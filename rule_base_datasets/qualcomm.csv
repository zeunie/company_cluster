Following an investigation, DRI has accused the Indian arm of the Chinese firm that produces and sells cell phones and different devices in India of ""evading customs duty by way of undervaluation"", an announcement issued by the finance ministry stated.

""At Xiaomi India, we give utmost importance to ensuring we comply with all Indian laws. We are currently reviewing the notice in detail. As a responsible company, we will support the authorities with all necessary documentation,"" a spokesperson for the Chinese firm's Indian arm stated. DRI had lately carried out searches at Xiaomi India, which allegedly led to the restoration of incriminating paperwork, indicating that Xiaomi India was remitting royalty and licence charge to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, beneath contractual obligation.

The funds weren't being added within the transaction worth of the products imported by Xiaomi India and its contract producers. DRI has alleged that not together with these within the assessable worth is a violation of the Customs Act. ""The investigations conducted by the DRI further showed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in India by importing parts and components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India. The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement,"" the official assertion stated.

The tax demand is for the interval between April 2017 and June 2020.

In a separate case, final month, the earnings tax division had carried out raids towards Chinese cellular producers Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus.","{'uri': 'pehalnews.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pehal News'}",[],https://www.pehalnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BSF-jawan-arrested-for-raping-Bangladeshi-woman-India-News.jpg,0.1843137254901961,eng-7385274,False,0.8549019694328308,0.1843137254901961,379122480,1

Both the iQOO 9 and iQOO 9 Pro can be had with BMW M stripes on the back in a special version.

The 'vanilla' phone comes with a flat screen - a 6.78"" 1080x2400 AMOLED panel with 120 Hz refresh rate and 1,500 nit peak brightness, more specifically. On the rear it has Samsung's ISOCELL GN5 1/1.57"" sensor for its main 50 MP camera with f/1.75 aperture and OIS, alongside a 13 MP 120-degree ultrawide, and a 12 MP 2x zoom lens. Selfies are taken care of by a 16 MP snapper with f/2.45 aperture.

Running the show is Qualcomm's latest and greatest, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, paired with 8/12GB of RAM and 256/512GB of UFS 3.1 storage. The 4,700 mAh battery charges at 120W, with a promised time from zero to 100% of just 19 minutes. The phone runs OriginOS Ocean based on Android 12.

iQOO 9 colors

The iQOO 9 is offered in the three colorways you can see above and starts at CNY 3,999 (approximately $629 or €556 at the current exchange rates) with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The next step up keeps the same storage amount but bumps up the RAM to 12GB, and this version can be yours for CNY 4,399 ($692 or €611), while the top of the line iteration has 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for CNY 4,799 ($755 or €667).

As you can tell from the currencies used, this was a China-only launch. For now it's unclear when the iQOO 9 will make it to other countries.

The Pro model keeps the same screen size of its sibling but makes it curved and hikes the resolution all the way up to 1440x3200. The refresh rate is the same at 120 Hz but this is an LTPO 2.0 panel, which means it should be able to vary it from 1 Hz to 120 Hz dynamically.

The SoC at the helm is unchanged too, as is the main rear camera. However, the ultrawide here is a 50 MP one with a 150-degree field-of-view (which would be record-breaking had the Realme GT 2 Pro not been announced first). As for the tele, that's a 16 MP unit with 2.5x optical zoom. The selfie snapper stays the same though.

iQOO 9 Pro colors

Also unchanged is the 4,700 mAh battery with 120W wired charging, but the iQOO 9 Pro also gets 50W wireless charging and 10W reverse wireless charging support. Like its sibling, it too runs OriginOS Ocean based on Android 12. Weirdly enough, the Pro loses one color option and, as you can see, settles for two instead of three.

This model can be yours for CNY 4,999 ($786 or €695) with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, CNY 5,499 ($865 or €763) with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and finally if you want to go all in for the 12/512GB model you'll have to pay CNY 5,999 ($943 or €834). Sales for both devices start in China on January 12.","{'uri': 'gsmarena.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'GSM Arena'}",[],https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/22/01/iqoo-9-9-pro-announced/-728x314/gsmarena_001.jpg,0.2392156862745098,eng-7385589,False,0.7607843279838562,0.2392156862745098,379122420,1

The self-driving vehicle for personal use is being co-developed with GM's majority-owned Cruise, Barra said at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, in a remote keynote message focused on the twin themes of vehicle electrification and autonomy.

Barra said GM's expanding portfolio of electric vehicles, including the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup and the BrightDrop commercial vehicle range, also features two new Chevrolet crossovers, a $30,000 Equinox EV and a slightly larger Blazer EV, both of which will be introduced in 2023.

GM's new Ultra Cruise hands-free driving system will also debut in 2023 on another new EV, the Cadillac Celestiq ultra-luxury sedan. Barra said Ultra Cruise will use Qualcomm's new Snapdragon Ride compute platform for advanced driver assistance.

At last year's CES, Cadillac raised a few eyebrows with two futuristic concepts, including a flying car. At this year's event, Barra unwrapped a third Cadillac concept, the InnerSpace, described as a self-driving, two-passenger luxury coupe.

A fourth Cadillac concept, the OpenSpace, was teased in a brief video as a ""vision for the next decade and beyond."" It was described by a GM insider as a ""luxury hotel room on wheels.""

The Korean company is making changes to its most popular series, which affect the most advanced model. We already told you that the Galaxy S22 Ultra will be renamed Galaxy S22 Note. This change brings important news to the Samsung catalog, as the disappearance of the Note becomes less dramatic. Today we know that the Samsung most powerful of 2022 will arrive with 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage.

One of the latest leaks claims that the most advanced version of the new Galaxy S22 series It will come with astonishing hardware worthy of the most advanced gaming mobiles on the globe. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Note will include 16 GB RAM and 512 GB storage.

Of course, these two memories will come with the chips most advanced on the market: LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage. This setting may only be available on the Galaxy S22 Note and not on the Galaxy S22 and S22 +. These two could reach configurations of 12 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage at the most.

A couple of months ago the possibility came to light that SamsungFor the first time in a long time, do not use two different processors in the models dedicated to the US or China. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 was almost confirmed as the only chip of the Galaxy S22.

Now everything seems to change and this leak / rumor loses steam. In 2022 the Galaxy S22Again, they will be manufactured with two different processors depending on the sales market. In the US and China Samsung will bet on Qualcomm and in the rest of the world by Exynos.

It is a strategy that many users have been criticizing for years, since Qualcomm is always usually one step above Exynos as far as power is concerned. It is difficult to draw conclusions before the processors are in real devices, but everything indicates that in 2022 the Qualcomm superiority over Exynos.

Still, if you are thinking of buy a Galaxy S22 It shouldn't matter to you whether it includes one processor or another, since it has been shown that the differences in day-to-day life are minuscule and you can do the same with both devices obtaining practically the same experience.

If you want an extremely powerful phone the Samsung Galaxy S22 Note it will be one of the best on the market. Of course, its price could be around 1,500 euros / dollars.","{'uri': 'bullfrag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bullfrag'}","[{'uri': 'pooja_pundir@bullfrag.com', 'name': 'Pooja Pundir', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.proandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Samsung-Galaxy-s22-note-1.png,0.2784313725490195,eng-7385191,False,0.7803921699523926,0.2784313725490195,379121820,3

Intel, clinging to its title of world's largest chipmaker by revenue, showed off graphics chips aimed at fighting Nvidia and AMD in their area of domination. Nvidia's latest chips are targeted at persuading more laptop owners to choose its highly specialised graphics capabilities, and AMD touted products meant to maintain its market share gains.

Qualcomm, the biggest maker of mobile-phone chips, bolstered its push to win a chunk of the personal-computer market, leveraging its strength in smartphone technology.

The flurry of announcements at the annual CES technology conference, based in Las Vegas but mostly taking place virtually, highlights the shifting competitive landscape for the group of companies whose technology rules the computer and mobile-phone industries. Intel's loss of leadership in chip-manufacturing technology has exposed it to challenges from newly confident rivals in the PC market. The company's response under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is to defend that market and, at the same time, to chase sales in its rivals' strongest businesses.

That fight will likely play out beyond 2022, with most analysts predicting Intel will struggle to boost sales this year, compared with revenue gains forecast for the other companies.

Still, on Tuesday, investors rewarded Intel's aggressive competitive posture. While chip stocks in general lost ground, Intel shares rose as much as 1.4%. Nvidia and AMD, which were among the best-performing stocks of 2021, each fell more than 5%. Qualcomm slid as much as 2.8%.

In an online presentation earlier in the day, Intel announced its 12th generation Core mobile processors, including 28 new models that are as much as 40 percent faster than their predecessors. Crucially, it also said new Arc graphics chips are being shipped to PC makers, including Acer Inc., Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc., which will use them in upcoming machines aimed at gamers.

The Arc chips are Intel's attempt to cut into the dominance of Nvidia and AMD in high-end graphics. More laptops are using add-in graphics cards to bolster capabilities in gaming and content creation, which are increasingly determining customer preferences. Intel's chips in the past have only offered graphics built into main microprocessors, typically with less power to generate realistic images.

Nvidia countered by unveiling new graphics chips for laptops, aimed at bringing high-end gaming and artificial intelligence capabilities to the thinnest and lightest computers.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics processor will equip notebooks that will be priced starting at $2,499, giving them better capabilities than many previous high-end desktop models, Nvidia said Tuesday in a virtual presentation. Laptop models running on the 3070 Ti chip will start at $1,499.

Nvidia, whose market value is larger than any other chipmaker, is rolling out new products as it works to broaden the reach of its technology into the laptop market. Most thin computers contain what's called integrated graphics, capabilities typically built into central processors from Intel or AMD.

Also as part of CES, AMD CEO Lisa Su showed off new laptop and graphics processors, meant to continue the company's run of stealing market share from Intel. AMD's graphics chips have come closer in performance to Nvidia's, but the larger company still controls the majority of the market for add-in cards for PC gamers that can cost more than $1,000.

And in one of the few remaining in-person appearances at CES, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke about his commitment to bringing smartphone technology-based processors to the PC market. He listed customers such as Microsoft Corp., Acer and Lenovo.

Qualcomm's chief also talked up his push into automotive semiconductors, unveiling chips that will help cars pilot themselves. That move will put him in more direct competition with Intel's Mobileye unit and Nvidia, which is also working to make chips to be the brains of vehicles of the future.","{'uri': 'intellasia.net', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'IntellAsia'}",[],,0.2392156862745098,,True,0,0.2392156862745098,379121760,3

The hawkish tone of the minutes spooked investors, sending the S&P 500 down 1.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.3%.

Intel, however, was a notable exception.

The rest of the sector, however, reflected tech companies' sensitivity to rising interest rates, which The PHLX Semiconductor Index, or Sox, was down about 3.2% on Wednesday. Shares of Nvidia (ticker: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slid more than 5% to $276.04 and $136.15, respectively. Both companies, after strong performances in 2021, failed to with to send shares even higher this week.

That's typically when Meta -- the company formerly known as Facebook -- holds its developer conference.

Given that Meta changed the name of the Oculus Quest 2 to the Meta Quest 2, it's likely that this project is codenamed internally as Meta Cambria, as Lynch suggested in his tweet.

Lynch's report is also corroborated by Display Supply Chain Consultants, or DSCC, which also claims that Meta is set to launch a ""high-end headset"" in 2022. Per DSCC's report, which also swings in past comments by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Connect 2021, said Project Cambria ""will enable high resolution color passthrough AR. The device will be 'pushing the limits of display technology and form factor' and will be based on pancake optics, which enable a slimmer form factor.""

Meta already confirmed that Project Cambria would be coming out in 2022, though no specific date was given.

Per Lynch, Project Cambria is looking to sell 3 million units and will feature Mini LED displays, like the ones found in the 2021 iPad Pro. Combining Mini LED with pancake optics, which involve folding light ""several times over,"" could make for a thinner and lighter VR headset with fantastic colors.

At Connect 2021 last year, Meta already confirmed that Project Cambria would not be a replacement to the Quest 2 or the Quest 3, but ""a high-end device at a higher price point, packed with all the latest advanced technologies, including improved social presence, color Passthrough, pancake optics, and a lot more.""

Meta also published a quick teaser video last year of Project Cambria, which looks very similar in design to the first Oculus Quest.

As for the Oculus Quest 3, Lynch claims the headset will not utilize Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR3 processor, which is expected to ship in late 2023. Instead, Meta is trying to make a chip of its own that's better designed for VR. And apparently Meta wants to differentiate itself from other VR headset makers by not packing in a Qualcomm chip. The current Meta Quest 2 uses the Snapdragon XR2.

According to Lynch, the Quest 3 will use uOLED displays.

Of course, fans are wanting to know whether they should buy a Meta Quest 2 now, wait for Project Cambria or hold out even longer for the Meta Quest 3. According to Lynch, Meta is hoping to announce the Quest 3 at or after Connect 2023 next year. The past few Connects took place in the September-October timeframe, meaning that Connect 2023 might take place then. If true, that means Meta's next-gen headset is almost two years off.","{'uri': 'tomsguide.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': ""Tom's Guide""}","[{'uri': 'imad_khan@tomsguide.com', 'name': 'Imad Khan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XHLYMi5nptfKowwigTD3f-1200-80.jpg,0.05882352941176472,eng-7387084,False,0.6431372761726379,0.05882352941176472,379120860,2

Android's January security patch is out, and it's addressing one of the nastiest Android bugs to come up in some time: certain apps can stop you from contacting 911 or other worldwide emergency services numbers.

In early December, a harrowing tale popped up in the GooglePixel subreddit from a user whose Pixel 3 crashed when they needed it most: while dialing 911 for their grandmother who ""appeared to be having a stroke."" The whole phone subsystem seemed to immediately crash upon calling emergency services, with user ""KitchenPicture5849"" saying they couldn't get the call to connect or hang up to try the call again. Luckily, a nearby landline was available after their Android phone let them down, and emergency services was able to be contacted.

After the crisis was over, the user gave calling 911 from their smartphone another shot, and Android crashed again, indicating it wasn't a one-off bug. A check of their phone bill also revealed that KitchenPicture5849 never actually connected to 911. They say they also got a few other DMs from users reporting that they were experiencing the same bug.

Google contacted the user and publicly responded to the post on December 8:

Based on our investigation we have been able to reproduce the issue under a limited set of circumstances. We believe the issue is only present on a small number of devices with the Microsoft Teams app installed when the user is not logged in, and we are currently only aware of one user report related to the occurrence of this bug. We determined that the issue was being caused by unintended interaction between the Microsoft Teams app and the underlying Android operating system. Microsoft has collaborated closely with Google to resolve this unintended interaction.

Google said that Microsoft would be pushing an app update out ASAP and that users should check for an update in the Play Store. The company also mentioned that an OS-level patch would be out a full month later, in early January (that's today). Then Google provided no further comments on the issue.

Why apps can break 911

Hold up. Microsoft Teams broke 911? Random Android apps can break the emergency services functionality? How? Why can third-party apps come within a thousand feet of such a critical function? Do any other apps break 911, or just Microsoft Teams? While Teams got fixed, was it really OK to let Android users hang out with this OS-level bug for a month, especially when we have no idea if other apps are doing it? Android being Android, many phones will never get patched anyway. How can users know emergency services will work? Other than saying to wait a month for a fix, Google wasn't providing any answers.

Luckily, some very smart people in the Android community could provide the answers Google wouldn't share. Mishaal Rahman, the Senior Technical Editor for Esper, wrote an incredible Medium post detailing how the bug works and why it happens. Apps on Android with phone call functionality can register a ""PhoneAccount"" with the system indicating they have some capability of placing calls. There are a few flags apps can set with PhoneAccount, including one called ""CAPABILITY_PLACE_EMERGENCY_CALLS."" When the time comes to call to 911, Android sorts the list of PhoneAccounts that have been registered and picks one. This all seems fine so far.

One of the several bugs identified in Rahman's post is that Microsoft Teams will register an additional PhoneAccount with the system every time Teams starts up, provided you aren't logged in. Note that this isn't the rare occurrence of installing Microsoft Teams and then never using it -- a common complaint of the Teams Android app is that it frequently logs users out automatically. If you're logged out, launching Microsoft Teams 10 times will result in 10 duplicate PhoneAccounts from Teams clogging your phone. Teams shouldn't do this, and Microsoft's update stopped Teams from doing this, but a bunch of duplicate PhoneAccounts also shouldn't be enough to bring Android's phone system to its knees.

Next bug: when picking a PhoneAccount to run the emergency call through, Android goes through a complicated sorting process to figure out which account to use. The last step in this sort process, the tiebreaker, is sorting by hashcode. The hashcode comparison just subtracts one hashcode from the other. But just like that stupid Y2K22 Microsoft Exchange bug from the other day, it's possible for this to result in an integer overflow or underflow, and now the phone subsystem is going to crash. Google's code is buggy, but since it's the last sorting tiebreaker after trying more obvious things like the package name, it should only get invoked in the very specific instance of an app spawning duplicate PhoneAccounts. So thanks, Microsoft!

Google's fix for this bug is here, titled ""Fix the integer overflow/underflow caused by sorting of duplicate phone accounts during emergency call attempt."" Instead of subtracting one hashcode from another and potentially running into a really big or really small number that crashes the system, Google now runs the two numbers through the java function ""Integer.compare."" This only returns -1, 0, or 1, indicating a smaller, identical, or bigger compare result.

If you're like me at first and wondering why Android is sorting through phone accounts at all rather than just using the default account on the SIM card, I'll take a wild guess and say this was an attempt at making 911 work no matter what. Just in case the main account doesn't work, Android wants a list of every possible phone account it can try, and it wants to do that automatically, to connect to 911 by any means necessary. This sorting system only exists for contacting emergency services, which is why regular phone calls still work for the affected users.

A third bug in this mess is that Microsoft Teams does not even register itself as an emergency call handler. Teams made a million PhoneAccounts, and it did not use the flag ""CAPABILITY_PLACE_EMERGENCY_CALLS,"" but it still broke 911. Google's sort process starts with querying all phone accounts when a better first step would be to start with all emergency call-capable phone accounts. Google is taking an even more drastic solution to this last bug and culling every ""self-managed"" phone account from the system's 911 procedure. ""Self-managed"" Android phone accounts, like Microsoft Teams, get more direct access to the Android telephony stack and can roll their own features. The Android emergency call system will now only consider simpler telephony providers that plug into the default phone app, like your carrier account. All those other VoIP apps can still probably be used to contact 911 on their own (many countries require 911 functionality by law). But if you open the default dialer and hit ""911,"" Android is only going to pick from standardized, system-managed phone accounts.

Who's getting patched, and how you can check for the 911 bug

Rahman says Google's bug for this is CVE-2021-39659, which the monthly security bulletin categorizes as a high-severity ""denial of service"" vulnerability with patches for devices running Android 10, 11, and 12. In the Android codebase, Google is actually backporting this fix all the way to Android 8.0, which technically isn't supported anymore. This is mostly purely theoretical since zero manufacturers are actually pushing security updates to devices this old. But the code is there if anyone wants it.

Android's telephony stack is not (yet?) an easily updatable Project Mainline module, so the only way you're getting a fix is via the Android January 2022 monthly security update. Samsung should be updating every phone on this list starting this week, while Google is pushing out fixes for the Pixel 3a, 4, 4a, 5, and 5a.

An update is not arriving for the Pixel 6 yet. Google's newest flagship is going though a bit of an update crisis at the moment. The December 2021 update was pulled due to unrelated ""mobile connectivity issues"" (phone calls don't work). While Google scrambles to fix everything, the next Pixel 6 update with this 911 fix is due in ""late January."" Until then, it's normal to be on the November patch. Both of Google's ""early January"" and ""late January"" patch timelines seem incredibly slow for a bug that could cause users to literally die.

I'll take another wild guess and say the Pixel 6 is the odd phone out because it's a totally different SoC and modem (both from Samsung's Exynos division, while every other Pixel uses Qualcomm). Making the holiday shopping season didn't give Google much wiggle room for launch delays. That doesn't make it any less disappointing for a phone with the big selling point of day-one updates, but hopefully, this is a temporary problem.

I'm amazed that this is only a ""high"" severity bug (instead of ""critical"") and that the roll-out is taking one-to-two months. Delaying an ambulance could be fatal, so it would be nice if all of this arrived faster, instead of how Google is choosing to deal with the issue.

If you're waiting for a patch, or if you have one of the billions of Android devices that won't ever get patched, there is a way to see if your phone is currently overflowing with duplicate PhoneAccounts. Mobile security analyst Linuxct whipped up the incredible ""PhoneAccount Abuse Detector,"" an open-source app that will just list every phone account currently registered on your device. There's no hard rule here, but you should be seeing about one Phone Account per VoIP app.

So far, we've only heard of Microsoft Teams triggering this bug with duplicate phone accounts, but there's no telling if any other apps are making a similar mistake. If you see an app on this list generating tons of duplicate accounts, there's a chance it will stop you from connecting with emergency services. I recommend uninstalling the app, contacting the developer, and letting the rest of us know on Twitter or something.","{'uri': 'arstechnica.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Ars Technica'}","[{'uri': 'ron_amadeo@arstechnica.com', 'name': 'Ron Amadeo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ambulance-lights-760x380.jpg,-0.2470588235294118,,False,0,-0.2470588235294118,379120740,1

As such, the 10.5 inch tablet supports up to 8GB of LPDDR4x memory, up to 128GB of eMMC storage, and features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c processor.

Thanks to a detachable keyboard and support for an optional digital pen, you can use the tablet like a laptop or a writing & drawing slate. The pen supports Microsoft Pen Protocol 2.0 and slides into a garage in the tablet for safe keeping when you're not using it.

So the tablet is versatile. It's just not all that powerful, with the kind of specs you'd typically find on a Chromebook rather than a high-end Windows PC. In fact, the entry-level configuration looks even more Chromebook-like, with just 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.

The tablet does have a few nice features including a 1920 x 1200 pixel IPS LCD touchscreen display, a 13MP world-facing camera and 5MP front-facing camera which should come in handy during Zoom calls, and a USB 3.0 Type-C port and 3.5mm audio jack.

Other features include stereo speakers, dual microphones, a 38 Wh battery, and support for WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0. The tablet comes with a 45W USB-C power supply and there's optional support for a keyboard with backlit keys.

The Asus ExpertBook B3 Detachable measures 260 x 172 x 9mm (10.2'' x 6.8'' x 0.4'') and the tablet weighs 630 grams (1.4 pounds), plus another 245 grams for the keyboard and 172 grams for the detachable kickstand which brings the total weight to 1.05kg (2.3 pounds).

With COVID-19 cases surging to all-time highs, tech giants like Google and Microsoft are among those who have decided they won't be physically present at CES 2022, the massive annual consumer electronics trade show being held this week in Las Vegas.

But the show must go on. Whether they'll be there in person or participating virtually, some of Southern California's most notable tech firms will be taking part in CES -- including using the opportunity to unveil new products and services.

Santa Monica-based electric scooter operator Bird is among those who will be in the house at CES. The company has a 3,500-square-foot interactive booth, which will highlight how its scooters positively impact the economies and carbon emissions of more than 350 cities globally. Bird will also be showcasing vehicles including its new electric bike, the Flex e-scooter, and the Birdie Glow children's kick scooter.

In the realm of electric automobiles, Manhattan Beach-based Fisker will be showcasing its Fisker Ocean all-electric SUV and highlighting the vehicle's digital radar-enabled driver assistance system. And Playa Vista-based VinFast Automotive will reveal its complete EV lineup, announce prices for its two electric SUVs, and share its plans to cease manufacturing gasoline-powered vehicles by the end of this year.

On the hardware front, San Diego-based wireless technology firm Qualcomm is a prominent presenter at this year's event; the company is using the opportunity to reveal a partnership with Microsoft on chips for the Seattle giant's new AR glasses, as well as expanded relationships with automakers Volvo, Honda, and Renault. Irvine-based gaming hardware firm Razer is rolling out new models of its Blade gaming laptop (among an array of other products), and will be livestreaming an in-person event at its RazerStore in Las Vegas on Thursday.

While Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon is one of the few major CEOs speaking on-site at CES, other SoCal-based companies have opted instead for a virtual or limited presence. That includes two of the region's social media giants: Culver City-based social media giant TikTok announced last month that it would be participating digitally ""in light of the increase in positive COVID-19 cases across the country,"" while Santa Monica-based Snap plans to keep a small presence at CES, primarily for managing sales meetings.

The world of crypto and blockchain technology will also be represented at CES. One of L.A.'s most notable NFT companies, Blockparty, will be in attendance and recently announced the launch of its new app just in time for the expo. The app allows content creators to securely connect an NFT to a physical object and tokenize physical goods.

This year's hybrid edition of CES, which runs Jan. 5-7, will be more abbreviated than the usual four-day affair. ""We are shortening the show to three days and have put in place comprehensive health measures for the safety of all attendees and participants,"" Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), the event's organizer, said in a press release.

Still, more than 2,200 exhibitors are expected to attend in-person following last year's virtual-only event. The CTA is providing attendees with a complimentary Abbott BinaxNow COVID-19 self-testing kit to test for the virus within 24 hours of entering the venue. For international attendees, there will be complimentary PCR testing for those who require a test to travel abroad after the show ends.","{'uri': 'dot.la', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'dot.LA'}",[],https://dot.la/media-library/file-ces-2012-central-hall-floor-6764012529-jpg-wikimedia-commons.jpg?id=28738103&width=1200&coordinates=0%2C400%2C0%2C0&height=600,0.1450980392156862,eng-7384930,False,0.47843137383461,0.1450980392156862,379119840,2

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has said that the Indian arm of Chinese mobile manufacturer Xiaomi has evaded customs duty of Rs 653 crore via undervaluation of imports.

Acting on intelligence, the DRI had launched an investigation against Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers, the finance ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The duty evasion took place between April 2017 and June 2020.

""During the investigation, it emerged that the 'royalty and licence fee' paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software, China (related party of Xiaomi India), were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers,"" the ministry said.

Xiaomi India sells the Mi brand of mobile phones, which are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in the country by importing parts and components by the company's contract manufacturers. Mi brand phones manufactured by contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, under the contract agreement.

Evidence gathered by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufacturers had included the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by them, which is in violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962, and Customs Valuation (determination of value of imported goods) Rules, 2007.

An even more premium audio brand than Master & Dynamic, Mark Levinson, long owned by Harman (now a Samsung subsidiary), is known for its high-end amps, preamps and turntables that also have numbers for names.

The No. 5909 are Mark Levinson's first headphones and yes, they're expensive at $999 (£1,000, approximately AU$1385). However, judging from my conversation with Master & Dynamic's Levine and the number of AirPods Max models I see on people's heads in the streets of New York City, there are plenty of folks who don't mind dropping big money on a set of cans. The fact that the No. 5909's cost about double what the AirPods Max cost could very well make them more desirable to a certain class of buyers.

Not surprisingly, the No. 5909 are really good headphones. They have a sturdy design without managing to feel hefty on your head (read: they're substantial but not too heavy) and they're comfortable to wear over long periods thanks to their nicely padded (and replaceable) leather-covered earcups and headband. They fold flat but not up, and are similar in some ways to the Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 in that they have an aluminum frame and seem hard to break.

Features-wise, most of what you'd expect in a pair of premium wireless headphones is here: Strong, effective noise canceling, a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in (I thought it sounded pretty natural) and sensors that automatically pause and resume your music when you take the headphones off and replace them on your ears, respectively. Battery life is rated at up to 30 hours with noise canceling on at moderate volume levels, and they appear to have multipoint Bluetooth pairing (so you can pair them to two devices simultaneously), but I'm still awaiting confirmation of that.

While they have 4-microphone technology for voice calls instead of 6-microphone technology, I tested them on the noisy streets of New York City and callers said my voice sounded clearer compared to the AirPods Max, and the headphones did a good job muffling background noise. They were superior to the AirPods Max for voice calls. That said, I do think the AirPods Max's noise-canceling is superior overall. And the AirPods Max feature Apple's spatial audio virtual surround sound with head tracking that I find enhances my movie and TV watching experience (I'm less enamored with it when it comes to music listening).

As for sound, it's a fairly even battle if you're streaming wirelessly from an iPhone. The No. 5909 are high-res certified with support for Sony's LDAC and Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive codecs that allow for near-lossless streaming over Bluetooth. Apple's iPhones and iPads don't support those codecs while certain Android devices do. Using the No. 5909 headphones over Bluetooth on my iPhone 13 Pro, it sounded a tad more natural and refined than the AirPods Max (the No. 5909 had a touch more ""pure"" and accurate sound).

I did notice a difference when I paired the No. 5909 to my Google Pixel 4 XL, which has support for LDAC (you can turn on ""HD Audio: LDAC"" in the settings next to the headphones in the Bluetooth menu so you know you're actually getting LDAC). I use the Qobuz audio streaming service that offers high-res streaming, and the sound while listening to the No. 5909 on the Pixel 4 XL was noticeably better. Overall, the sound had a little more depth and texture, and there's a touch more sparkle, definition and openness. (The AirPods Max add similar depth when you use them in wired mode.)

The press release for the headphones talks about how the headphones are optimized for the Harman Curve, which is a way of describing how the headphones have been tuned to a balanced sound profile with the option to boost the bass or ""attenuate"" it in the companion app. The EQ consists of 3 bass ""countour"" settings -- neutral, enhanced and attenuated. That's it, which I liked.

Headphones like the Sony WH-1000XM4 that also have support for LDAC streaming over Bluetooth aren't a huge step behind the No. 5909. But the No. 5909 definitely sound better with superior overall clarity, definition and accuracy (they are clearly the more articulate headphone). It's easily one of the best-sounding Bluetooth headphones if you have the right device and streaming service (services such as Tidal offer ""high-resolution"" streaming but I prefer Qobuz).

But Bluetooth is Bluetooth, and the truth is if you're really serious about your music listening, you're going to do it with a set of wired headphones and not bother with wireless. Mark Levinson is accommodating in that regard. You get a couple of sets of cables that allow you to plug into a headphone jack (you get one long and one shorter USB-C to 3.5mm cable) and you can store all the cables, including the USB-C charging cable, in a compartment in the headphone's case.

Going wired, you'll get another slight bump in sound quality, especially when you get into true lossless music, and the headphones sound excellent in wired mode. However, I think there are plenty of less expensive wired headphones that measure up pretty well to the No. 5909. For instance, I plugged in a set of $300 Beyerdynamic DT 700 Pro X ""studio"" headphones for comparison and ended up finding the two headphones almost equally appealing with only a slight edge to the No. 5909 (I found them slightly warmer).

Anyway, the No. 5909 are great wireless headphones and excellent headphones overall. I liked them a lot, but then again, I didn't have to pay $1,000 for them.

I'll still need to use them for another week or so before I post my full review with a rating, but in the meantime here's a look at the headphones' key specs.","{'uri': 'cnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNET'}","[{'uri': 'david_carnoy@cnet.com', 'name': 'David Carnoy', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/DOQLd49meBmNo2q4JOf0QASeHP0=/1200x630/2022/01/05/3e625962-72a2-4180-9ce6-486219423775/mark-levinson-no-5909-headphones-1.jpg,0.2313725490196079,eng-7383204,False,0.6000000238418579,0.2313725490196079,379118220,1

If you're a Samsung fan looking to buy a new phone this year, there's a good reason why you might find yourself deciding between two devices. The Galaxy S22 is expected to be the successor to the Galaxy S21, meaning it'll be the least expensive model in Samsung's new Galaxy S family. And the Galaxy S21 FE is a more budget-friendly version of the Galaxy S21. So both the S22 and the S21 FE are expected to be on the lower end of the spectrum when it comes to price.

There's likely to be a notable cost difference between them, though. The Galaxy S22 will probably be more expensive than the $700 Galaxy S21 FE, and rumors suggest it'll include a sharper camera and faster processor to justify that difference. Still, the Galaxy S21 FE might still have the edge when it comes to screen size and battery life.

Here's a closer look at what we're expecting to see based on the rumors.

The Galaxy S22 is shaping up to be Samsung's option for those who prefer a compact phone, like the Galaxy S10E. The Galaxy S22 may have a 6.06-inch screen, according to specifications published by prominent leaker Ice Universe. The Galaxy S21 FE, on the other hand, features a 6.4-inch display. Just like the S21 FE, the Galaxy S22 is expected to have a display refresh rate of up to 120Hz.

If the leaks turn out to be true, the Galaxy S22 will be smaller than the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S20. In comparison, the Galaxy S21 FE falls between the sizes of the Galaxy S21 and the Galaxy S21 Plus.

For cameras, the Galaxy S22 is expected to have a 50-megapixel wide lens, a 12-megapixel ultrawide lens and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens. That's according to Twitter leaker Tron, who has a mixed track record when it comes to reporting on unreleased Samsung products. (He correctly said the Galaxy Z Fold 3 would be slimmer than its predecessor, but he also said the Galaxy Z Flip 3 would cost $1,249 whereas it actually starts at $999.99). The Dutch website Galaxy Club, which has been posting a lot of leaks that have yet to be confirmed about the Galaxy S22 series, also says the lineup will have a 50-megapixel main sensor and a 12-megapixel wide sensor. In addition, it suggests the phone could have a 10-megapixel front camera.

If these rumors turn out to be true, the Galaxy S22 will have a much sharper main sensor than the Galaxy S21 FE, but a slightly less sharp selfie camera. Samsung's budget phone has a triple-lens camera. That's a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, a 12-megapixel wide camera and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera, as well as a 32-megapixel front-facing camera.

Samsung also makes its own line of Exynos processors, but those chips are usually available only in certain areas -- not including the US. And that's a shame, because the next version of Samsung's Exynos chip sounds like it could potentially bring a big leap forward in graphics performance. Samsung and AMD are collaborating on a future Exynos chip, which will bring high-end gaming features like ray tracing to Samsung phones. But Samsung and AMD haven't revealed further details about the chip, such as when it'll launch or which products it'll be in.

The Galaxy S21 FE, by comparison, runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, the same processor that powers the Galaxy S21. That means the phone's performance is similar to the Galaxy S21, which will likely be considered a previous-generation product in the not-too-distant future.

Samsung was seemingly focusing on screen size and battery life with its most recent budget phone. The Galaxy S21 FE has a 4,500-mAh battery capacity. The Galaxy S22, on the other hand, is expected to come with only a 3,700-mAh battery, according to leaks from Ice Universe and Galaxy Club. That would make it smaller than the Galaxy S21's 4,000-mAh battery. But keep in mind that the Galaxy S22 is also rumored to be smaller.

In terms of memory and storage, we're expecting to see 8GB of RAM and 256GB of space. That's according to a YouTuber called Super Roader, who claims to be a former employee of Samsung's wireless division. The amount of RAM we see in the Galaxy S21 FE is similar, with options for either 6GB or 8GB.

The Galaxy S21 FE comes fitted with a 6.4-inch screen. This makes it just a bit larger than the Galaxy S21's display, which has a 6.2-inch screen. The Galaxy S21 FE is a good middle ground for those who want a screen that's bigger than the S21's but not as large as the 6.7-inch Galaxy S21 Plus.

Just like the Galaxy S21, Samsung's new budget phone comes with a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. The Galaxy S21 FE also uses Samsung's Dynamic AMOLED technology and has an FHD+ resolution the same as the Galaxy S21. However, the pixel density, or number of pixels per inch, is lower than the Galaxy S21's since the S21 FE's screen is larger, but the difference isn't noticeable.

Like many of Samsung's other Galaxy phones, the Galaxy S21 FE comes with a triple-lens camera. The smartphone is fitted with a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 12-megapixel wide camera, an 8-megapixel telephoto camera with a 30x digital zoom and a 32-megapixel front-facing camera.

The Galaxy S21, by comparison, has a triple-lens camera with a 12-megapixel wide, 12-megapixel ultrawide, and 64-megapixel telephoto lens with a 10-megapixel selfie camera.

That suggests the Galaxy S21 FE may take sharper selfies, but the Galaxy S21 will likely take crisper zoom and ultrawide shots. It sounds like Samsung wants to provide the flexibility that comes with having three cameras and multiple shooting modes, but may have opted for lower-resolution sensors to keep the price down.

One area where Samsung didn't compromise is in the Galaxy S21 FE's performance. It runs on Qualcomm's high-end Snapdragon 888 processor, just like the Galaxy S21. This is a key factor that distinguishes the Galaxy S21 FE from Samsung's other budget phones, namely the Galaxy A52 5G, which runs on a less powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G 5G chip.

In terms of RAM, or random access memory, Samsung gave the Galaxy S21 FE options of 6GB or 8GB. RAM is essentially your phone's short-term storage. It lets you jump right back into an app and pick up where you left off without having to reload, making the experience feel snappier. The Galaxy S21 comes with 8GB of RAM.

Galaxy S21 FE additionally comes with a 4,500-mAh battery, which is larger than the regular Galaxy S21's 4,000-mAh battery.

After one day of the 2022 version of CES, it is abundantly clear that automobiles are (pun intended) the driving force behind a huge chunk of the innovations on display in Las Vegas both in-person and virtually.

It doesn't matter what kind of company it is, if they aren't showcasing some innovative aspect of autonomous vehicles and computer-assisted driving systems, they are not generating as much buzz in 2022; in fact, just about every major company - from Qualcomm and Microsoft to small startups you have never heard of - made big announcements related to the auto industry at CES.

Those of us who follow CES for potential security industry innovation may have been a bit disappointed by this turn of events, but this is a case where it helps to see the forest instead of the trees.

The good news is that like most hot tech trends in the long history of CES, the R&D and innovations pouring into one industry are bound to leak into another, and the vast resources being put into technologies to power autonomous vehicles and Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) will uncover innovation in the security industry.

Here are some show floor examples that made big news on day one of CES:

LiDAR technology has long been foundational to autonomous vehicles, but as our tech expert correspondent Steve Surfaro has written about on multiple occasions, it is building a place among perimeter security options.

""The biggest barrier is that prices need to come down to allow our industry to really drive mass adoption and democratize LiDAR so that more people can use it in more applications,"" said Dr. Ted Tewksbury, CEO of LiDAR provider Velodyne, during a virtual CES press conference. ""The prices will come down as they always do when new technologies start to get the volume. One of our pillars is to develop new architectures that will bring down prices so that we can drive broader adoption of LIDAR across a wider range of applications.""

Autonomous vehicles are hungry for the processing power these chips provide. A company like NXP Semiconductors may not be focused on video surveillance, but its flagship S32R45 and new S32R41 processors are enabling 4D imaging radar for 360-degree surround sensing in cars. It isn't hard to imagine these innovations coming to an intelligent security camera in the near future.

One of the goals of ADAS is to create a more user-friendly and safer driving experience by making display technologies easier to disseminate in real time.

Qualcomm - a company more known for its smartphone technologies - made big news at CES with its newest Snapdragon Cockpit Platform, which ""features enhanced graphics, multimedia, computer vision and artificial intelligence capabilities to provide a more integrated, contextually aware and constantly adaptive cockpit system that evolves to its passengers' preferences. The 4th Generation Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms are engineered as a homogenous and multipurpose solution to address the transition to zonal architectures, serving as a central hub for high-performance compute, computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-sensor processing with a flexible software configuration to address the compute, performance and functional safety needs for that zone or domain.""

These chips will be featured in new vehicles from Volvo and Honda in the future, but once fully adopted by the automotive industry, imagine what these chips could do for an operator in a modernized Security Operations Center or monitoring center.

In order to perform optimally, exterior automotive cameras and systems need nearly perfect vision that cannot be obscured. In searching the CES exhibitors, I found a company that has created a waterdrop resistant glass to be used in the lenses of these cameras. This technology is already being used for outdoor security cameras as well (more on that in the days to come from Surfaro, who is on site).

Cybersecurity is a big deal when it comes to autonomous vehicles. As cars get more connected, the risk of cybersecurity breaches increases - and just like CISOs dealing with evolving ransomware threats, it is a constant battle to keep up with changing methods and attack vectors.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), in fact, created in August ISO/SAE 21434, a standard that addresses the cybersecurity perspective in engineering of electrical and electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles.

C2A Security, a provider of trusted automotive cybersecurity solutions, earned a CES 2022 Innovation Award for its flagship product, AutoSec, a comprehensive cybersecurity lifecycle management system (CSMS) that empowers industry stakeholders to identify and mitigate cyber-attacks in this challenging environment.

According to a press release, the product ""allows organizations to manage all of their cybersecurity needs in one centralized location, including Threat Modeling (TARA), vulnerability management, and in-vehicle protection, along with collaboration, delegation of threat identification, and prevention across the supply chain. Its embedded orchestration layer significantly shortens response time to security events.""

Such is the case of the latest collaboration announced by Qualcomm and Microsoft, who have decided to work together ""to expand and accelerate the adoption of augmented reality (AR) in both the consumer and enterprise sector.""

Qualcomm and Microsoft will be working together to develop custom AR chips to enable new power-efficient, and lightweight AR glasses aimed to deliver rich and immersive experiences. Both companies are also planning on integrating software like Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Space XR Developer Platform.

Hugo Swart, vice president and general manager of XR, Qualcomm Technologies, said that ""Qualcomm Technologies' core XR strategy has always been delivering the most cutting-edge technology, purpose-built XR chipsets and enabling the ecosystem with our software platforms and hardware reference designs. We are thrilled to work with Microsoft to help expand and scale the adoption of AR hardware and software across the entire industry.""

While Rubén Caballero, corporate vice president of Mixed Reality, Microsoft explained that their goal ""is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation.""

""With services like Microsoft Mesh, we are committed to delivering the safest and most comprehensive set of capabilities to power metaverses that blend the physical and digital worlds, ultimately delivering a shared sense of presence across devices. We look forward to working with Qualcomm Technologies to help the entire ecosystem unlock the promise of the metaverse.""

Finally, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon expressed that they are ""developing a custom augmented reality Snapdragon chip for next-generation, power-efficient, very lightweight AR glasses for the Microsoft ecosystem.""

""And we're integrating into that chip platform software from both companies: the Microsoft Mesh platform and the recently announced Qualcomm Snapdragon Spaces XR development platform. Snapdragon Spaces will be fully integrated into Microsoft Mesh, and this platform will be available for next-generation lightweight glasses.""

We will have to wait sometime to see the results of this collaboration, but we can expect great things from this collaboration, as Qualcomm and Intel are two well-known companies in the tech world, with some of the most powerful chipsets in the market.","{'uri': 'pocketnow.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pocketnow'}",[],https://media.pocketnow.com/styles/large/public/2022-01/Qualcomm%20Microsoft%20Collaboration.jpg?itok=0LLm9KkY,0.4901960784313726,eng-7383810,False,0.9098039269447327,0.4901960784313726,379116480,5

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has joined the board of prpl Foundation, the organization announced Wednesday. prpl Foundation is a non-profit focused on improving security and interoperability of embedded devices, with a particular focus on ""Open Gateway"" Customer-Premises Equipment (CPE). AWS IoT Greengrass is the template for a new cloud-to-CPE architecture aimed at service providers.

The organizations are hoping to harmonize cloud-to-CPE app lifecycle management, with AWS's own IoT services platform as the framework for standardization. The objective of their effort is to build a platform-independent service delivery framework to manage cloud-to-CPE app orchestration - not something that's specific to AWS.

Leonard Dauphinee, president of prpl Foundation, said that service providers are increasingly turning to carrier-grade open-source software to manage a burgeoning variety of CPE hardware platforms. That makes it imperative for them to adopt a more modular design approach, he added.

""With containerization, providers can further simplify the scaling of operations,"" said Dauphinee.

""The announcement aims to help standardize cloud-based application orchestration to manage the life cycles of containerized software components for next-generation customer-premises equipment (CPE) software stacks. This will enable service providers to more easily scale operations through the containerization of apps and services, moving away from monolithic firmware updates to a modularized approach that allows for simplified CPE application deployments and updates,"" said prpl in a statement.

IoT Greengrass is AWS' open-source edge runtime and cloud service for Internet of Things (IoT). IoT Core connects and manages IoT device fleets without requiring servers to be provisioned or managed.

""AWS IoT Core and AWS IoT Greengrass, along with other AWS cloud services, provide built-in capabilities for CPE devices, including security, updateability, easy configurability and reliability at scale. Many service providers and CPE vendors are looking for these capabilities as they build with prpl's open reference architectures to implement a modular design approach for CPE software stacks that leverage the advantages of the cloud,"" said Shyam Krishnamoorthy, General Manager, AWS IoT.

This past July, the Broadband Forum and prpl Foundation announced a collaboration to develop the User Services Platform (USP/TR-369) standard as the backbone of future modular smart gateways. Their goal is to create a secure, cross-platform service delivery framework.

Other prpl Foundation members include Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Dish, Vodafone, and Qualcomm.","{'uri': 'rcrwireless.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'RCR Wireless News'}","[{'uri': 'peter_cohen@rcrwireless.com', 'name': 'Peter Cohen', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.rcrwireless.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Industrial-IoT-Image.jpg,0.223529411764706,,False,0,0.223529411764706,379116360,1

Dubbed simply the Vision-S 02, the midsize sport utility appeared remarkably production ready inside and out, and appeared on stage alongside the Vision-S sedan prototype that had been undergoing testing for the past two years.

The seven-seat SUV concept is based on the same platform as the sedan, which was developed with a number of supplier partners including Magna Steyr, Qualcomm, Nvidia, ZF, Continental, Bosch, and others. The latest concept once again showcases a number of technologies from the electronics giant, including an advanced driver-assist system equipped with LiDAR and wide dynamic range CMOS image sensors, with Sony indicating that it is currently conducting verification tests aimed at the release of a Level 2+ semi-autonomous driver-assist system. That's right: Sony is working on its own semi-autonomous system, that will be roughly analogous to the ones currently on the market.

Interior tech aimed at passenger use is also one of the main aims of this concept, with Sony demonstrating a large front panoramic screen featuring gesture and voice controls, in addition to two rear-seat screens.

""Vehicle settings, key locks, and user settings can be synchronized by linking the vehicle to the cloud using mobile communication, including 5G communication, which features low-latency, high-capacity, and high-speed capabilities,"" the company noted. ""In addition, since updates are reflected in the vehicle via over the air (OTA), it is possible to provide security and evolve service functions and value-added offerings continuously.""

Arguably the bigger piece of news at CES than the concept itself was the planned launch of Sony Mobility Inc. later this spring, via which Sony ""intends to explore entry into the EV market.""

Does this mean Sony plans to become an automaker in the near future?

This still appears to be up in the air, as it has been for at least the past two years, but it's worth noting that Sony has managed to create not one but two working prototypes with the help of its supplier friends, so most of the ingredients certainly appear to be there if it were to go the direct-sales route like Tesla and Polestar. It's also worth noting that Sony has been road-testing its sedan prototype since its first appearance two years ago while playing coy regarding an outright entry into the EV market.

The planned formation of Sony Mobility Inc. is another step in that direction, even if Sony has not made up its mind regarding becoming an EV maker. At the very least, at this point Sony appears to have come much further publicly than Apple in taking that step.","{'uri': 'autoweek.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Autoweek'}",[],"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/1-1641405003.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.584xh;0,0.323xh&resize=640:*",0.2078431372549019,eng-7384366,False,0.658823549747467,0.2078431372549019,379114320,1

Qualcomm (QCOM) executives announced on Tuesday that the company will work with Microsoft (MSFT) on next-generation chips for lightweight AR glasses. This is a big deal.

Investors should consider buying Qualcomm shares.

This is not the first time Qualcomm and Microsoft have collaborated. The Snapdragon 850 chip powers Microsoft's HoloLens headset. Headsets like goggles were born in 2010 as an expensive toy, a $ 3,000 add-on for Xbox gaming consoles. Headsets have evolved into mixed reality industry and even military applications.

Microsoft announced in March 2021 that it had won a $ 21 billion contract to supply the US Army with military units.

The appeal of AR technology is hands-free operation. The ability to instantly see information in real time makes a lot of sense for maintenance workers repairing power lines and military cognitive personnel at the scene. Really lightweight devices may have a wider range of appeal.

It's clearly the market that Qualcomm is focusing on.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Qualcomm ceo Cristiano Amon unveiled the Snapdragon Spaces XR, a development platform that integrates into Microsoft Mesh software for lightweight AR glass. The last part is important. These devices are glasses, not goggles or headsets.

When moving to AR glasses, Qualcomm and Microsoft will be in direct competition with Apple (AAPL). CEO Tim Cook told analysts in 2016 that AR could be huge, and companies based in Cupertino, California promised to invest accordingly. Since then, Apple has filed numerous patents, acquired start-ups, hired a new product manager, and launched ARKit, an AR software developer kit. Apple's AR glasses are clearly in the product pipeline.

Jaguar Note, based in Cupertino, California, is setting the trend.

The company launched AirPods in 2016 and spread the ridicule. The wireless white earphones were expensive, poor sound quality, and looked like a pair of golf tees hanging from the wearer's ears. Airpods had all the landmarks of a huge failure. Then cool kids started wearing them. According to Min-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TFI Asset Management, Apple could have sold 90 million pairs in the last two months of 2021.

Now Apple is trying to make AR cool. Qualcomm is ahead of the wave of new buyers.

As AR becomes mainstream, it's a mistake to think of Apple as the only logical winner. Qualcomm has won the high-end smartphone chip war by creating a microprocessor that works well across the Android ecosystem. Today, the Snapdragon family of processors is used in 70% of top-tier Android smartphones, including most new Samsung devices, despite the fact that major Korean electronics manufacturers make competing processors.

What Amon and his predecessor were right was integration and partnership.

Transactions with Microsoft have traditionally continued. Based in Redmond, Washington, the software giant has the marketing power to expand lightweight AR glasses on the market.

For the time being, Qualcomm has a strong portfolio of chipsets across different sectors.

Qualcomm was a notable partner on Nio (NIO) Day in January 2021. Chinese car makers have announced a high bandwidth / low latency 5G, Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 6, and an ET7 sedan with an always-on network connection for a complete user experience from vehicle to everything.

Apple also relies on Qualcomm for its 5G modem. After several years of proceedings, the two companies signed a $ 4.5 billion deal in April 2019 to bring Qualcomm's best-in-class wireless technology to the iPhone and iPad. The license is valid until 2025.

Qualcomm was a strong trader in a turbulent market. Tuesday's closing price was $ 187.23, less than 1% from record levels. Stocks are traded with only 16x futures earnings and 6.2x sales.

Given the strong outlook for AR growth, these ratios look very cheap.

The DRI has issued three show cause notices to the company in order to recover the amount.

According to officials, the investigation by the DRI was initiated based on an intelligence input that Xiaomi India was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation. The probe was conducted against Xiaomi India as well as its contract manufacturers.

WHAT DID DRI FIND?

During the investigation, searches were conducted by the DRI at the premises of Xiaomi India. This led to the recovery of incriminating documents which indicated that the company was remitting royalty and licence fees to Qualcomm USA and Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd. under contractual obligation.

The statements of key individuals associated with Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of the company purportedly confirmed the aforementioned payments.

""During the investigations, it further emerged that the royalty and licence fee paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., China [related party of Xiaomi India] were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers,"" a statement by the Union finance ministry said.

Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones. These devices are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in India by importing components of the mobile phones via contract manufacturers. The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, as per the contract agreement.

""Evidence gathered during the investigations by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufactures were including the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of the Customs Act and Customs valuation [determination of value of imported goods] Rules 2007. By not adding royalty and licence fee into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading customs duty, being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof,"" the finance ministry's statement added.

According to the DRI, between April 2017 and June 2020, Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited evaded custom duty of Rs 653 crore.

The moves include a new computer vision processor called the Snapdragon Ride Vision System, which will deliver advanced driver assistance via onboard cameras beginning in 2024.

The San Diego company's new leading-edge chip will square off against Intel's Mobileye -- the dominant firm in machine vision technology used in cars. Mobileye announced its own new chip at CES to help enable autonomous driving in partnership with Volkswagen and Ford.

Qualcomm also unveiled digital cockpit/infotainment deals with Volvo, Honda and Renault to bring onboard connectivity, high-tech dashboards and entertainment systems to vehicle models, some of which are arriving this year.

""We are always going to be the company focused on mobile, but there is more to Qualcomm,"" Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said at a press conference at CES, previously known as the Consumer Electronics Show. ""Car companies, many of them now, are tech companies. Technology assets have become extremely important.""

Automakers have embraced technology not only to make vehicles safer but to potentially enable new revenue streams in the era of electric and autonomous cars. They include possible subscriptions for onboard services as more screens are installed in vehicles.

Chip sales to automakers reached $1 billion last year for Qualcomm -- mostly from connectivity and infotainment systems. Auto revenue is forecast to climb to $3.5 billion annually in five years.

The company currently has a $13 billion order pipeline across its digital chassis portfolio for cars, which includes 4G/5G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, audio, rear-seat video and digital dashboards -- as well as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies.

BMW and General Motors are Qualcomm's cornerstone customers, but it sells to myriad other brands ranging from Hyundai to Audi, Chrysler to Lexus.

With the new Snapdragon Ride Vision System, Qualcomm isn't targeting full driverless capabilities known as Level 4 autonomy, at least for now.

Instead, it's steering toward driver assistance camera systems that help motorists behind the wheel without taking complete control. It aims to make technology flexible enough to be offered across all vehicle price ranges, said Amon, from luxury to entry level.

""When we think about ADAS, we think the real opportunity is to attach Level 2 and Level 3 to every car,"" said Amon. ""It can become as pervasive as anti-lock braking systems and airbags.

""We are working on full autonomy as well,"" he continued. ""We know that has more regulatory challenges and needs more time to mature. But the opportunity to do Level 2 and Level 3 as an assisted solution to the driver is real and is one that can really scale.""

Last year, Qualcomm joined with private firm SW Partners to acquire Swedish auto technology firm Veoneer for $4.5 billion. The complex deal calls for Qualcomm to retain Veoneer's Arriver autonomous driving software stack, while SW Partners will sell off the rest of Veoneer's remaining auto sensor businesses.

Arriver software is included in the Snapdragon Ride Vision System.

With Volvo, Qualcomm inked a deal to supply Snapdragon Cockpit technologies to infotainment systems in upcoming fully electric SUVs under the Volvo and Polestar brands.

The first vehicles are slated to hit the market later this year. Working with Google's Android automotive operating system, the SUVs will feature hands-free help from Google Assistant and navigation with Google Maps, among other things.

Honda will begin using Qualcomm's digital cockpit chips in models expected to hit the market in the second half of this year in the U.S. The technology will be available in Honda cars globally in 2023.

Renault Group also plans to plug in Qualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chassis technologies but didn't reveal when vehicles would be available.

Qualcomm's shares ended trading Tuesday up slightly at $187.23 on the Nasdaq exchange.

The two companies believe better hardware is the key to encouraging adoption, so they've decided to work together to create custom chips for AR glasses.

Microsoft and Qualcomm already have a strong partnership with respect to Windows on Arm. The Redmond giant integrated a custom Snapdragon chipset into the Surface Pro X, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 powers its HoloLens 2 mixed-reality headset. According to Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, over 200 enterprise customers have adopted Snapdragon-powered laptops so far.

The two companies have announced plans to collaborate on developing custom augmented-reality chips to use in future lightweight and energy-efficient glasses that work within Microsoft's ecosystem. The renewed partnership was revealed during Qualcomm's CES 2022 keynote and is part of the two companies' strategy to accelerate the adoption of mixed-reality solutions for consumer and enterprise sectors.

Another part of the plan is the integration of two AR software platforms -- Microsoft Mesh and the Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform.

""This collaboration reflects the next step in both companies' shared commitment to XR and the metaverse,"" Qualcomm's Vice President and General Manager of XR Hugo Swart explained in a statement. ""We are thrilled to work with Microsoft to help expand and scale the adoption of AR hardware and software across the entire industry.""

""Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future--a future that is grounded in trust and innovation,"" added Rubén Caballero, corporate vice president of Mixed Reality at Microsoft. ""With services like Microsoft Mesh, we are committed to delivering the safest and most comprehensive set of capabilities to power metaverses that blend the physical and digital worlds, ultimately delivering a shared sense of presence across devices.""

The ""metaverse"" is still a nebulous term that seems to encompass everything from augmented reality to virtual reality, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and more. Microsoft says it's working on a more practical version of this concept, and enlisting Qualcomm's help for developing purpose-built chips and improving reference hardware does seem like a logical move. The two companies didn't provide a timeline for when we'll be able to see the fruits of this new partnership, so we'll have to wait and see.","{'uri': 'techspot.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechSpot'}","[{'uri': 'adrian_potoroaca@techspot.com', 'name': 'Adrian Potoroaca', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://static.techspot.com/images2/news/ts3_thumbs/2022/01/2022-01-05-ts3_thumbs-119.jpg,0.3176470588235294,eng-7383810,False,0.8039215803146362,0.3176470588235294,379112040,5

Launched at a Chinese event in late December, and presented alongside a Pro sibling, this will likely be one of the best phones of 2022, and it'll go up against rivals like the Samsung Galaxy S22, OnePlus 10 and iPhone 14 if it's going to win that crown.

The Xiaomi 12 follows the Mi 11 (Xiaomi dropped its 'Mi' identifier in mid-2021), and following the release pattern of that phone, we'll likely see a global launch sometime in February or March.

Thanks to its launch event, we know most of the Xiaomi 12 and Xiaomi 12 Pro's information - find out everything you need to know about each of the mobiles below.

The Xiaomi 12 series made its debut in China on December 28, but we'll likely have to wait until February or March until a global launch. That's according to some top leakers, anyway.

We'll have to wait until then to get the official international pricing - but we've got how much the devices will cost in China for different configurations, and we'll put that below along with conversions, but just use these as references for now.

That price might not convert exactly with the Xiaomi 12 series though, as the main phone is quite a bit smaller than the Mi 11, with the 12 Pro being the 11's true successor. That is to say, the Xiaomi 12 could launch for less than the Mi 11 did.

The Xiaomi 12 is a rather petite thing, with a 6.28-inch display, though its Pro sibling bumps that right up to 6.73 inches. The smaller mobile has a 1080 x 2400 resolution while the bigger one goes to 1440 x 3200.

That's not the only screen difference - while the Xiaomi 12 has an OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1100 nits max brightness, the Pro has an AMOLED panel with 120Hz refresh and 1500 nits max brightness. Both support Dolby Vision and HDR10+.

Both phones look roughly the same, other than the size. The screens curve at the edge, and are broken up by a 'punch-hole' at the center-top that houses the selfie camera.

On the back, the cameras are housed in rectangular bumps with one giant and two smaller lenses - sadly, the stepped look of the Xiaomi Mi 11 has been forsaken. The devices come in black, gree, blue or pink.

Both the Xiaomi 12 and 12 Pro have the same 50MP f/1.9 main camera and 32MP selfie snapper, but that's where the photographic similarities end.

The Xiaomi 12 gets the 5MP telemacro camera that we enjoyed on the Mi 11 for close-up pictures, as well as a 13MP f/2.4 ultra-wide camera. However the Pro gets a 50MP f/1.9 telephoto camera for 2x optical zoom, and a 50MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera too.

In total, the Xiaomi 12 gets exactly 100MP shared between its four cameras, but the Pro has a grand total of 182MP.

Battery-wise, there are fewer differences, as the Xiaomi 12 gets a 4,500mAh power pack and the Pro gets one just 100mAh bigger.

While both mobiles get 50W wireless and 10W reverse wireless powering, the Xiaomi 12 Pro once again gets ahead with its super-speedy 120W wired charging - that's a spec we saw on the Xiaomi 11T Pro, allowing for incredibly quick recharges, and it's a lot quicker than the Xiaomi 12's 67W.

Both the Xiaomi 12 and 12 Pro get Qualcomm's newest super-powerful chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, paired with either 8GB or 12GB RAM as we've already explained.

How fast is this processor? Well, definitely a little faster than the older Snapdragon 888, though we haven't actually tested it in a phone just yet.

These mobiles are the latest from Xiaomi to have speakers tuned by Harman Kardon, a big name in the audio space, so sound played out loud should sound great.

The software is Android 12, with Xiaomi's MIUI 13 laid over the top - this is the latest version of MIUI and its highlights are security and user interface customization.

The Xiaomi 12X was launched alongside the two phones we've detailed - it's basically the same as the 12, but with an older chipset, and it also likely won't launch outside China.

We've heard rumors about quite a few different Xiaomi 12 phones in the family other than the two launched ones, including two Lite models and an Ultra model.

Most recently we hearda leak about a Xiaomi 12 Ultra Enhanced, an even more premium version of the top-end phone, though we don't know what distinguishes this from the other model.

Later in 2022, we'll also likely see a Xiaomi 12T series, of mid-range takes on the main-series phones.","{'uri': 'techradar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechRadar'}","[{'uri': 'tom_bedford@techradar.com', 'name': 'Tom Bedford', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BGaA2CmXAZmbUkzMK6AbK4-1200-80.jpg,0.2313725490196079,eng-7385274,False,0.6941176652908325,0.2313725490196079,379111980,1

Qualcomm Inc. on Tuesday said it is working with Microsoft Corp. on custom chips that would control lightweight augmented reality glasses for use by both consumers and businesses for metaverse apps.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said during a press conference that the two companies will work together to mate the custom chips with the software developers need to create virtual worlds in which people can work and play.

He said future devices from the collaboration will work with a Microsoft software product called Mesh that allows users to beam a realistic likeness of themselves into the headset of another user so that it feels like the two people are in the same room.

The future hardware will also use software from Qualcomm called Snapdragon Spaces that helps perform basic augmented reality functions like mapping out physical spaces so that digital objects can be overlaid on them and hand-tracking so that users can manipulate those digital objects with hand gestures.

""We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale,"" Amon, one of the few major tech executives not to cancel his physical presence at the trade show, said from a livestreamed talk on stage in Las Vegas.

The two companies did not give details about when the chips and headsets would be available.

""Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation,"" Rubén Caballero, corporate vice president for mixed reality at Microsoft, said in a statement.","{'uri': 'news.cgtn.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'news.cgtn.com'}",[],https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-01-05/Qualcomm-Microsoft-partner-on-metaverse-chip-for-AR-glasses-16zQgtAg73a/img/9b64873c09044cf68edbd13751afbc78/9b64873c09044cf68edbd13751afbc78-750.jpeg,0.3254901960784313,,True,0,0.3254901960784313,379111020,2

""After completion of the investigation by the DRI, three showcause notices have been issued to M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited for demand and recovery of duty amounting to Rs. 653 crore for the period April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962,"" the Finance Ministry said in a statement issued Wednesday.

The showcause notices have been issued following recovery of documents during searches on its premises that indicated remittance of royalty and licence fee to US and Chinese firms under contractual obligations.

Evidence gathered during investigations by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufacturers were including the amount of royalty paid by the firm in the assessable value of the goods imported by the company and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of the customs law.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Xiaomi said the company would support the authorities will all necessary documentation.

""At Xiaomi India, we give utmost importance to ensuring we comply with all Indian laws. We are currently reviewing the notice in detail. As a responsible company, we will support the authorities with all necessary documentation,"" a spokesperson for the company said.

By not adding royalty and licence fee in the transaction value, Xiaomi India was allegedly evading Customs duty, being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof, the ministry said. During the investigations, it further emerged that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by the firm and its contract manufacturers, it said.","{'uri': 'indianexpress.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}",[],https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/01/Xiaomi-New-Logo-1.jpg,,eng-7385274,False,0.8509804010391235,,379110060,1

If you like devices, you are probably among the 66% of households that have smart home devices, according to Deloitte. We also know you don't just stick with one company or brand, but probably have purchased from at least half a dozen different companies. That's why for any company launching a smart home device this year, having Matter support will be helpful.

Not only is the protocol being developed by some of the biggest tech companies -- think Apple, Amazon and Google -- and smart home device makers, it is designed to finally fix the issues around fragmented smart home systems so that all of your devices can be easily set up and routed from one place.

Matter, via a local controller device, is essentially the infrastructure, the pipeline and the language that will enable all of the devices to communicate. Its Internet Protocol will define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification so that manufacturers can build devices that are compatible with your Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Matter's first protocol will run on Wi-Fi and Thread network layers and will utilize Bluetooth Low Energy for commissioning.

The Connectivity Standards Alliance, formerly the Zigbee Alliance, which is organizing the testing for the first Matter-certified devices, identified over two dozen companies that were exhibiting or showcasing Matter at their booths, meeting rooms or virtually at CES this year. They include NXP, Qualcomm, Samsung SmartThings, Telink, Texas Instruments and Universal Electronics.

In May, Google said it was bringing Matter to Android and Nest, and today announced that in a few months, you will be able to use its Android ""Fast Pair"" feature to quickly connect new Matter-enabled smart home devices to your home network, Google Home and other apps with just a few clicks.

And earlier today, Amazon said its ""frustration-free setup"" documentation was now available for device makers to review, and it is working with a host of companies on both set-up experience and Alexa capabilities, including adding that device as a second administrator for Matter devices so you can still control them even if your internet connection is down.

It is also collaborating with silicon vendors on what will become a Matter System-on-a-Chip to support the frustration-free setup. All of this comes after last year's announcement that most Echo devices would support Matter and that 4th gen Echo and eero devices will become Matter Thread border routers.

In addition, here are some other companies that announced new devices or services that support Matter:

One device Michelle Mindala-Freeman, vice president of marketing for the Connectivity Standards Alliance, is watching is Schlage's announcement made Tuesday introducing it new smart Wi-Fi deadbolt, which will be among the first to support Apple's latest enhancement to its HomeKit experience with home keys capability.

She says 2022 will be a big year for Matter. There are hundreds of companies involved in both CSA and Matter, and 50 companies have brought through 134 products already, Mindala-Freeman told TechCrunch.

It is expected that CSA will have the certification, specifications, testing tools and SDK released by the middle of the year. This will enable companies to be faster to market with new hardware and innovations and reach a broader consumer audience.

""At a fundamental level, our job at CSA is to eliminate fragmentation and help companies to grow and do it in a way that is highly valuable to consumers,"" Mindala-Freeman said. ""Standards like Matter do that, and we believe it is a rising tide that raises all boats.""","{'uri': 'finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

I have been going to CES since 2013 and last year the event was cancelled. This year it is back on but with many restrictions and requirements that kept us from making it out to Vegas. We're not the only ones though, many other media including corporate media did not go. So this year, once again we are evaluating the Best of CES 2022 from afar.

Estimated reading time: 19 minutes

Given that most of the items on our list we could not actually see, it was again, hard to choose the Best of CES 2022. So it is with our best virtual judgement, that we went through what we could to pick what we thought was the Best of CES 2022.

Congratulations to all of the winners and read on for the full rundown of what we thought cut the mustard at CES this year.

While this is technically a redesign, it's not grossly overdone or overthought. Dell struck a balance and paid tribute to its heritage while updating it simultaneously. The modern yet simple design tweaks only made this laptop look even sleeker than its older brothers.

The most noticeable difference in design is the keyboard and the apparent disappearance of the trackpad. That keyboard comes with broader keycaps which Dell calls ""zero-lattice."" The top row of F keys has been replaced with a capacitive touch area, and you can switch between function keys and media keys. This reminds us of Apple's TouchBar but maybe not as obnoxious and overthought.

Congrats to the Dell XPS 13 Plus for winning our Best of CES 2022 award!

If you're looking for your next gaming desktop or ATX case, the HP OMEN 45L is a clear winner. Not only does it have a solid design, but the separate Cryo Chamber offers additional and better liquid-cooling for your CPU. Easily expandable and customizable, this desktop should last you for quite a few years should you pick on up.

On the surface, The Freestyle portable projector by Samsung is a pretty decent first attempt from the company in this segment. It has a great picture and solid audio, however, some of the minor issues can make it a bit annoying to use at times. Hopefully, these are just issues with our pre-production unit and aren't present in the final production units. On that note, hopefully, we'll be able to have a look at a final production unit at some point soon and have a full review for you. Regardless, the Freestyle still earned our Best of CES 2022: Small Projector award.

Expanding screen real-estate for improved productivity and efficiency usually requires connecting a second display which is not typically portable. ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 changes that by introducing the industry's first 17.3-inch laptop with a built-in secondary 8-inch full-color LCD display.

Productive multitasking has become the new norm but often requires multiple devices and a larger workspace. Now with ThinkBook Plus Gen 3, that workspace becomes mobile. The ultra-wide 21:10 aspect ratio primary display already offers more space to take advantage of Windows 11 Snap layouts but adding a second touch-enabled display, with an integrated digital pen, presents new productive scenarios.

""Our goal is to support Volvo Cars by integrating cutting-edge, scalable, and upgradable technology that provides premium experiences today and into the future for their customers,"" said Enrico Salvatori, Senior Vice President and President of Europe/MEA, Qualcomm Europe, Inc. ""We are proud of the strong organizational concentration in automotive that we have in Europe, which spans across engineering, services, product marketing, and go-to-market.""

Although the system will be based on the Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms, users will still interact with a Google Android operating system. Volvo says it will be the first automaker to directly integrate Google Assistant-enabled devices into its vehicles. It will also soon add YouTube as a built-in app in its cars.

By integrating its vehicles with Google Assistant-enabled devices, owners will be able to control a variety of the vehicle's features from outside their vehicle. A customer could, for instance, ask their assistant to warm up their car from the breakfast table if they notice that it's cold outside.

""Volvo Cars is a company that believes in collaborating with technology leaders such as Qualcomm Technologies Inc. and Google to deliver the best experience to our customers,"" said Henrik Green, Volvo Cars Chief Product Officer. ""With Qualcomm technology in our forthcoming fully electric SUV, our Google Android-based infotainment system will reach the next level.""","{'uri': 'carscoops.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Carscoops'}",[],https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-Volvo-C40.jpg,0.2862745098039217,eng-7386745,False,0.7568627595901489,0.2862745098039217,379109760,3

The collaboration between Arriverand Qualcomm Technologies is focused on meeting this challenge and will showcase the integrated software and hardware solutions that are anticipated to bring more safety benefits to more drivers starting in 2024.

A deeper, first-time look at the innovations coming from Arriver and Qualcomm Technologies will be on display in the Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall, booth #5005. Together, they will be showing how Arriver's perception and drive policy software enables safety and autonomy. These functions are delivered in a multi-domain approach - unique to Qualcomm Technologies - by combining ADAS and Infotainment and minimizing overall vehicle electronics complexity.

Just this past November, Arriver announced that it would work together with Qualcomm Technologies and BMW to deploy deep learning algorithms for vision perception with a full suite of full vision functions, among other innovations, combining the company's next-gen Vision Perception software with the Snapdragon Ride Vision System. The Vision Perception software represents an important first step in realizing Arriver's vision, having been created earlier in 2021 by Veoneer, a global leader in automotive technology, to create a world where people arrive safe and sound at their destination by combining human and AI to be the real-world standard in safe mobility.

The opportunity for such innovation is huge, in large part because of the need for roads that are safer for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. That need also defines the immense scope of the challenge, and we already have functional safety solutions in practice or production in all aspects of systems on chips (SoCs) from the ground to actuation/control (i.e., driving).

For instance, for a car to automatically map the environment around it and provide those insights to trigger automated responses (like braking) or warnings to drivers, sensors must not only be able to accurately capture that data but integrate with systems, both inside the vehicle and connected to it wirelessly, to augment, process, and apply it in real time.

Reliability is key, as it's not good enough to have a wonderfully detailed map that's either incorrect or out of date.

Arriver is one of the very few entities in the world with the ability to develop the necessary software to address this challenge - when put together it's called a ""stack"" - ranging from perception algorithms to support for automated driving features. When incorporated seamlessly with Qualcomm Technologies' industry-leading low power/high performance Snapdragon Ride platform - which took only a short time to port using the Snapdragon Ride SDK - it yields a fully functioning solution. The collaboration is poised to deliver not just next-gen technology but a solution that's road-tested and ready for production starting in 2024.

What's exciting for us is that our solution offers carmakers unique benefits that will help them speed delivery of greater safety benefits to their markets: It's scalable, working across a wide range of vehicle types; modular, so it can be combined with other products; energy efficient, providing industry-leading performance with very low power consumption, and; integrated with a deep understanding of performance requirements, called ""drive policy,"" so that our solution will work seamlessly with other vehicular systems.

As development continues toward a fully autonomous mass market vehicle (Level 5 in a scheme that ranks autonomous safety capabilities on a scale of 1 to 5), the automotive and commercial markets' need for greater safety will be filled with automated safety technologies that vary by model and region for the foreseeable future. These Level 3 and 4 technologies will share a common reliance on perception, or sensing what's going on inside the vehicle, the communication between vehicle and driver, and the vehicle's awareness of the world around it.

Arriver and Qualcomm Technologies are focused to meeting the challenge of providing those levels of perception and awareness and, in doing so, mapping the future for automotive safety.

Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi's India unit evaded customs duty worth Rs 653 crore by suppressing and undervaluing royalty and licence fee paid to overseas affiliates and partners, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) said on Wednesday.

Based on intelligence that Xiaomi India was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, the DRI had initiated an investigation against the company and its contract manufacturers. ""During the investigation, searches were conducted by the DRI, which led to the recovery of incriminating documents indicating that Xiaomi India was remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co, under contractual obligation,"" the agency said in a statement.

It said that statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments.

""During the investigation, it further emerged that the 'royalty and licence fee' paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported,"" the DRI said.

It said three show-cause notices had been issued to Xiaomi India to recover duty amounting to Rs 653 crore for the April 2017-June 2020 period, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962.

A company spokesperson said, ""At Xiaomi India, we give utmost importance to ensuring we comply with all Indian laws. We are currently reviewing the notice in detail. As a responsible company, we will support the authorities with all necessary documentation.""

The DRI said evidence gathered during the investigation indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufacturers were including the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported. By not adding 'royalty and licence fee' into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading customs duty being the beneficial owner of imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof.

Just last month, the tax department carried out raids on foreign mobile phone manufacturers, which could be liable to pay fines of up to Rs 1,000 crore. The search and seizure operations were conducted across several states on December 21. The action revealed that two major companies had made remittances in the nature of royalty to group companies located abroad, which aggregates to over Rs 5,500 crore. Evidence also emerged that the two companies could be under-stating taxable profit by more than Rs 1,400 crore. The earlier statement did not name the two firms. A report by NDTV said that they were Xiaomi and Oppo.","{'uri': 'business-standard.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Business Standard'}","[{'uri': 'arup_roychoudhury@business-standard.com', 'name': 'Arup Roychoudhury', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2022-01/06/full/1641411919-6785.jpg,0.2784313725490195,eng-7385274,False,0.8941176533699036,0.2784313725490195,379109220,2

Every year, CES unveils the newest technologies our industry has to offer, and this year, the event is once again setting a new standard for cutting edge devices. Technology brings us together and allows us to collaborate in a rich environment that meets the needs of businesses, students, educators, gamers and consumers. After a year of tremendous technological advancements, including the launch of Windows 11, CES 2022 gives us a front row seat to see how devices continue to evolve to meet customers' needs. I am looking forward to what we will see and hear from Microsoft's partners launching new devices and solutions that include powerful new silicon, plus features and functionality born out of incredible imagination and innovation. These richly capable devices and services are redefining how we work, play, learn and connect.

Devices focus on promise of greater good, improved security and performance

It's impressive to see the clear commitment to sustainability in the ecosystem, with so many companies designing sustainably minded devices this year. This is truly inspiring to see, and I believe these efforts will lead our entire industry towards better sustainability practices overall. From recycled paper for packaging and ocean-bound plastics used in chassis, screen bezels and keyboards, to purchases that give back, our ecosystem of device partners has clearly made a commitment to developing products with lighter ecological footprints. Even more impressive, is that they accomplished this without compromising on performance.

Themes of hybrid work and security are central to the discussion around devices, and it is clear the past few years have fostered great learnings that our partners have integrated into the design of these devices. These learnings - and the new ways of working - also influenced many of the innovations in the design of Windows 11. Windows 11, Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams, coupled with new products like Microsoft Viva - an employee experience platform that helps companies navigate how to empower people and teams to do their work from anywhere - on these cutting-edge devices, are extraordinarily powerful for customers. I am proud to see security at the forefront of our Windows 11 offering, and especially the new Microsoft Pluton processor, our collaboration with AMD and Qualcomm. The enhanced security at the core of Windows 11 PCs is incredible, and it's exciting to see AMD as our first partner to offer Pluton on the x86 platform, with the Lenovo Z Series!

The moves include a new computer vision processor called the Snapdragon Ride Vision System, which will deliver advanced driver assistance via onboard cameras beginning in 2024.

The San Diego company's new leading-edge chip will square off against Intel's Mobileye -- the dominant firm in machine vision technology used in cars. Mobileye announced its own new chip at CES to help enable autonomous driving in partnership with Volkswagen and Ford.

Qualcomm also unveiled digital cockpit/infotainment deals with Volvo, Honda and Renault to bring onboard connectivity, high-tech dashboards and entertainment systems to vehicle models, some of which are arriving this year.

""We are always going to be the company focused on mobile, but there is more to Qualcomm,"" Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said at a press conference at CES, previously known as the Consumer Electronics Show. ""Car companies, many of them now, are tech companies. Technology assets have become extremely important.""

Automakers have embraced technology not only to make vehicles safer but to potentially enable new revenue streams in the era of electric and autonomous cars. They include possible subscriptions for onboard services as more screens are installed in vehicles.

Chip sales to automakers reached $1 billion last year for Qualcomm -- mostly from connectivity and infotainment systems. Auto revenue is forecast to climb to $3.5 billion annually in five years.

The company currently has a $13 billion order pipeline across its digital chassis portfolio for cars, which includes 4G/5G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, audio, rear-seat video and digital dashboards -- as well as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies.

BMW and General Motors are Qualcomm's cornerstone customers, but it sells to myriad other brands ranging from Hyundai to Audi, Chrysler to Lexus.

With the new Snapdragon Ride Vision System, Qualcomm isn't targeting full driverless capabilities known as Level 4 autonomy, at least for now.","{'uri': 'arcamax.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ArcaMax'}",[],https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/221/22151/2215157.gif,0.2627450980392156,eng-7383748,False,0.6117647290229797,0.2627450980392156,379107600,4

Like fellow semiconductor giants, Intel and Qualcomm, Nvidia joined the party at CES 2022 where it showcased the latest generation of its Drive Hyperion 8 automotive stack. It is a suite of hardware solutions that will power self-driving cars and trucks. Hyperion 8 includes the latest Drive Orin system on chip, 12 surround cameras, nine radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, one front-facing LiDAR, and three interior cameras. Of course, the Orin chip crunches the data from all these sensors, radars, cameras, and LiDAR in real-time on-device.

Nvidia says the platform has been designed in such a way that there are multiple layers of redundancies baked in ensuring that a self-driving car can transport its passengers safely. Volvo and its subsidiary Polestar have announced that they will be integrating the Drive Hyperion 8 stack in their vehicles. Later today, Volvo along with LiDAR maker Luminar which whose hardware Nvidia integrates into Drive Hyperion 8 will share more information about what they are doing together.

Nvidia also has dealt with Chinese players like Nio, Xpeng, Li Auto, R auto, and IM motors - all of whom have adopted Drive Hyperion 8. In fact, considering Nvidia's hardcore chops in autonomous driving it even counts robotaxi startups like Amazon-owned Zoox, DiDi Chuxing, GM-backed Cruise, and trucking services like Navistar and Plus as its customers. Autonomous trucking company TuSimple has also built its latest platform on the Drive Orin autonomous chipset.

Nvidia also showcased Drive Concierge, an always-on, digital assistant for drivers which is part of the software that the world's most valuable semiconductor maker has been developing. Its Omniverse Avatar created an agent which leverages Nvidia's advances in speech recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, using recommendation engines and simulation technologies. It basically acts like Siri or the Google Assistant for the car and Nvidia even showed a demo of the restaurant reservation being done by the assistant using just speech.","{'uri': 'carandbike.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'carandbike'}",[],https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-11/5f2ac9fg_nvidia-_625x300_27_November_21.jpg,0.2705882352941176,,False,0,0.2705882352941176,379107180,1

However, there are still certain Android phones that come with a headphone jack. Most of these phones have budget lineups and are last-gen devices.

Even though smartphone users have requested phone companies to include the 3.5 mm headphone jack with their devices, the companies have already started to ditch the feature.

At this rate, there might come a time when all Android phones will come without a headphone jack. Thankfully, that time hasn't come yet, and there are still some Android phones with the headphone jack. These phone companies have heard the plea of their customers and decided to keep the 3.5 mm jacks.

Note: This article reflects the writer's personal opinion.

Even though many phone manufacturers have decided to lose the headphone jack, many Android devices still provide the 3.5 mm jack. With so many options, it always becomes tricky to narrow down the list to just five Android phones. So here is a list of the top five Android phones with 3.5 mm headphone jacks available today.

Top 5 Android phones with a headphone jack in 2022

Google Pixel 4a is one of the top five mobile phones with a 3.5 mm headphone jack. It also has other specifications, like fingerprint, barometer, accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.

In addition, it comes with a Li-Po 3140 mAh and a non-removable battery with a fast-charging feature. It also has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G Octa-core CPU and Adreno 618 GPU. Due to these reasons, Google Pixel 4a is very popular among its customers.

According to the users, the Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro is one of the best Android mobiles with a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Apart from this, it also comes with fingerprint, gyroscope and accelerometer sensors.

In addition, it has a 5160 mAh, non-removable battery and a fast-charging facility. Moreover, it comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 860 CPU and the Qualcomm Adreno 640 GPU. Furthermore, it has a 6.67-inch touchscreen display with 1080 x 2400 pixels resolution and 8GB RAM.

The Samsung Galaxy A52 is a phone with super AMOLED, 90Hz, 800 nits (HBM) and Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G Octa-core processor. Like the Google Pixel 4a, it also has an Adreno 618 GPU.

Furthermore, it comes with stereo speakers and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. It also has a Li-Po 4500 mAh, non-removable battery, and a fast-charging feature. Apart from these features, it is also available in four great colors- black, white, violet, and blue.

Asus Zenfone 8 is one of the best models in the Android phone market. It has a dimension of 148 x 68.5 x 8.9 mm and weighs 169 g. It comes with a Gorilla Glass front, an aluminum frame and a 3.5 mm headphone jack.

It also has Android 11 and ZenUI as its operating system, which can be upgraded to Android 12. Furthermore, it has Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Octa-core CPU and Adreno 660 GPU.

Oneplus Nord CE is the best Android phone on this list that comes with a 3.5 mm headphone jack. It weighs 170 g and has a dimension of 159.2 x 73.5 x 7.9 mm.

It is a phone with a Fluid AMOLED, 90Hz and has a 6.43 inch display screen. Furthermore, it comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G 5G Octa-core CPU. It can even support features like HDR, LED flash and panorama. In addition to this, it also comes with a Li-Po 4500 mAh, non-removable battery with a fast-charging facility.","{'uri': 'sportskeeda.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Sportskeeda'}",[],https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/01/932b9-16413241639518-1920.jpg,-0.02745098039215688,,False,0,-0.02745098039215688,379107000,4

Building upon Nokia's older C- and G-series devices, the phone maker announced the C100, C200, G100, and G400 models. In addition, it also showed a clamshell phone, the 2760 Flip.

We don't yet know the full specifications of these phones, as Nokia plans to share them closer to launch. We do, however, have enough information to paint a picture of the target audience for each.

Starting with the C-series phones, both handsets will come with a MediaTek Helio A22 SoC running Android 12 and packing 3GB of RAM with 32GB of storage. The C100 will feature a 5.45-inch display, an 8-megapixel rear camera, and a 4,000mAh battery. As for the C200, it also packs a 4,000mAh battery but has a 6.1-inch screen. The C100 is scheduled to release this quarter for $99, while the C200 should be out during Q2 2022 for $119.

Then, there are the new G-series phones, including the G100 and the G400. The G100 looks like most other $150 phones, featuring a 6.5-inch display with an HD+ resolution, a sizable 5,000mAh battery, a triple camera setup, and a built-in fingerprint sensor on the phone's power button. The SoC is said to be a Snapdragon 615, but the remaining specifications of this handset contradict that statement.

The SD615 is a 7-year-old SoC based on the 28nm process that only supports a single camera (up to 21MP). If the G100 has three cameras, it's hard to believe it comes with this SoC. Our bet is this handset instead uses the Snapdragon 662, which Qualcomm also refers to as SM6115 (hence, the confusion with the SD615).

The Nokia G400 should be the best phone of the batch, and that is reflected in its premium-like design.

Moving to the G400 specifications, it packs a 6.6-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a 5,000mAh battery, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. Out of all new Nokia phones, this is the only one that supports 5G connectivity, enabled the Snapdragon 480 5G it features. In addition, this phone uses a triple camera setup with a 48MP primary camera, a 5MP ultrawide, and a 2MP macro.

The G100 and G400 are coming in Q2 2022 for $149 and $239, respectively.

At last, there's the 2760 Flip, a clamshell phone designed to be intuitive and straightforward to use, focusing on providing users with a reliable device that can last. To further simplify the phone's usage, Nokia decided to use KaiOS, a mobile operating system based on Linux featuring basic Google services like Maps and YouTube, making this phone suitable for children and seniors.

The 2760 Flip features an external screen for notifications and an emergency side-button that can be configured to call a specific contact and share your location. Scheduled to release this quarter, the 2760 Flip will be available for $79.","{'uri': 'techspot.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechSpot'}","[{'uri': 'joao_silva@techspot.com', 'name': 'Joao Silva', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://static.techspot.com/images2/news/ts3_thumbs/2022/01/2022-01-05-ts3_thumbs-8e6.jpg,0.02745098039215677,eng-7385699,False,0.6745098233222961,0.02745098039215677,379106700,1

A show-cause notice has been slapped on Xiaomi India following recovery of documents during searches on its premises that indicated remittance of royalty and licence fee to US and Chinese firms under contractual obligations, the union finance ministry said on Wednesday.

Replying to an email query, a Xiaomi spokesperson said, ""At Xiaomi India, we give utmost importance to ensuring we comply with all Indian laws. We are currently reviewing the notice in detail. As a responsible company, we will support the authorities with all necessary documentation.""

Evidence gathered during investigations by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufacturers were including the amount of royalty paid by the firm in the assessable value of the goods imported by the company and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of the customs law, the ministry said.

By not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" in the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading customs duty, being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof, it added.

""After completion of the investigation by the DRI, three show cause notices have been issued to M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited for demand and recovery of duty amounting to Rs. 653 crore for the period April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962,"" the finance ministry said.

During the investigations, it further emerged that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by the firm and its contract manufacturers. Investigations further showed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by the company or assembled in India by importing components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India.

The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.","{'uri': 'dailypioneer.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Pioneer'}",[],https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,0.2,eng-7385274,False,0.929411768913269,0.2,379106100,1

Regardless of the outcome, a challenged Intel and Apple are good for the entire industry.

The company announced its new H-series Alder Lake mobile CPUs at CES 2022. The lineup includes the Core i9-12900HK, which Intel touts as the ""the fastest mobile processor. Ever.""

Here's what you should know about Intel's new chips, as well as how its flagship mobile silicon stacks up against Apple's M1 Max. The 12th-generation Alder Lake CPUs are Intel's first laptop chips to sport its hybrid architecture, which combines high-performance cores and efficient cores based on the company's Atom chips.

All of Intel's new chips are based on the company's ""Intel 7"" fabrication process, which is actually a 10nm process, Ars Technical points out. Intel justifies the name by claiming that its transistor density is similar to a 7nm process, and in any case, it's the first move away from the chipmaker's 14nm process in about six years.

In addition to the hybrid core design that's similar to Apple's, the new chips also support up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports, 96 EUs of Intel graphics, memory support for DDR5, LPDDR5, DDR4, and LPDDR4X, and offerings like Wi-Fi 6E and PCIe 4.0.

Intel did not unveil its entire lineup of Alder Lake chips at CES 2022. Instead, it showed off its most powerful 45W H-series chips. The company is also planning on releasing 9W U-series chips and 28W P-series chips later in the year.

The H-series chips follow the release of Intel's Alder Lake desktop CPUs in 2021 which also did not exactly sip power -- but that's less important in a desktop. The new announcements at CES could indicate that Intel is gearing up to try and take back its crown in the mobile processor space.

Intel's flagship Core i9-12900HK, which is a 14-core chip with six performance cores and eight efficient cores, is said to offer up to 28% faster gaming performance and 44% faster content creation performance compared to its predecessor. The company also says that the 5.0GHz chip can outclass both the AMD Ryzen 5900HX and Apple's M1 Max.

There are some caveats to Intel's own benchmark testing. For one, the Core i9-12900HK appears to outclass Apple's M1 Max at power draws over 35 watts. However, the M1 Max operates at a much lower wattage -- about 20 watts. If Intel's own figures are right, it takes twice the power to deliver 50% more performance than the M1 Max.

That means, when it comes to power efficiency, it's hard to beat Apple Silicon. In a mobile setup, efficiency is a key metric. For laptop users, getting that power to performance isn't the best tradeoff.

And with that power, will come heat. And fan noise.

Batteries in laptops can only get so big, because of FAA regulations, so a larger internal battery isn't an option, really. And, a discrete GPU, if utilized, will draw even more power than Intel's estimates above, and require more heat dissipation.

Intel said it conducted some of its productivity testing for platforms like Adobe Premiere Pro before those apps were optimized for Apple Silicon. Even then, the M1 Max was still neck-and-neck with the Core i9-12900HK in Premiere Pro.

All of this is to say that Intel's chips are powerful, but they're not necessarily M1 killers just yet -- particularly if you take power efficiency into account. While Intel's aim here is obviously to dethrone Apple by making chips better than the ""lifestyle company in Cupertino,"" it's not likely that the Alder Lake chips are going to end up being M1 killers.

For one, competition is good in the market. Apple delivered Apple Silicon in the Mac because Intel wasn't giving it what it wanted. The A-series processors that begat Apple Silicon were developed under pressure from Qualcomm.

If there's no hardware challengers, then there won't be improvement. Apple and Intel must continue innovating in the face of rivals -- Intel hasn't been a threat to Apple's chip dominance in years.

Of course, there's the matter of Intel chips not being currently available for hands-on testing. All chipmakers -- including Apple -- cherry-pick their benchmarks and specifications in announcements like these.

Until the new Alder Lake chips actually debut in a consumer machine, there's no telling whether they live up to Intel's claims -- or how they perform in real-world scenarios.

It's also clear that Apple will no longer rely on Intel-based chips for its Mac products. While better Intel chips and the race between it and AMD are going to make a difference for Windows or Linux users, those deeply integrated in Apple's ecosystem or who rely on macOS won't really be affected.

In other words, the new Alder Lake chips are a step in the direction of Intel becoming competitive again -- but Apple Silicon isn't going anywhere.

And both companies are made better by each other.

If you like devices, you are probably among the 66% of households that have smart home devices, according to Deloitte. We also know you don't just stick with one company or brand, but probably have purchased from at least half a dozen different companies. That's why for any company launching a smart home device this year, having Matter support will be helpful.

Not only is the protocol being developed by some of the biggest tech companies -- think Apple, Amazon and Google -- and smart home device makers, it is designed to finally fix the issues around fragmented smart home systems so that all of your devices can be easily set up and routed from one place.

Matter, via a local controller device, is essentially the infrastructure, the pipeline and the language that will enable all of the devices to communicate. Its Internet Protocol will define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification so that manufacturers can build devices that are compatible with your Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Matter's first protocol will run on Wi-Fi and Thread network layers and will utilize Bluetooth Low Energy for commissioning.

The Connectivity Standards Alliance, formerly the Zigbee Alliance, which is organizing the testing for the first Matter-certified devices, identified over two dozen companies that were exhibiting or showcasing Matter at their booths, meeting rooms or virtually at CES this year. They include NXP, Qualcomm, Samsung SmartThings, Telink, Texas Instruments and Universal Electronics.

In May, Google said it was bringing Matter to Android and Nest, and today announced that in a few months, you will be able to use its Android ""Fast Pair"" feature to quickly connect new Matter-enabled smart home devices to your home network, Google Home and other apps with just a few clicks.

And earlier today, Amazon said its ""frustration-free setup"" documentation was now available for device makers to review, and it is working with a host of companies on both set-up experience and Alexa capabilities, including adding that device as a second administrator for Matter devices so you can still control them even if your internet connection is down.

It is also collaborating with silicon vendors on what will become a Matter System-on-a-Chip to support the frustration-free setup. All of this comes after last year's announcement that most Echo devices would support Matter and that 4th gen Echo and eero devices will become Matter Thread border routers.

In addition, here are some other companies that announced new devices or services that support Matter:

Comcast mentioned it while launching its new xFi Advanced Gateway Router equipped with features like ""IoT for Smart Homes of the Future"" that was Zigbee and Matter compatible to act as a central connector for IoT and home automation devices like smart lights, plugs and locks. Eve Systems, which produces connected home products, created Eve MotionBlinds, touting it as ""the first connected blinds and shades motors in the market to support Thread."" Home security brand Arlo Technologies unveiled its Arlo Security System, a set of sensors with eight different functions, that correspond with a security hub and integrated keypad for small businesses and consumers that want more of a do-it-yourself security monitoring solution. The company also stated its commitment to Matter as a way of solidifying its stance on broad-range compatibility in the smart home space. Edge computing company Veea unveiled its Smart-home-as-a-Service offering which will include support for Matter, Thread and Wi-Fi 6. The offering includes the Veea SmartHub mesh router for the home called STAX. Among Belkin's several Matter-enabled product announcements at CES for the home are its new Wemo video doorbell that works with Apple's HomeKit, and the Wemo Smart Plug, Smart Light Switch and Smart Dimmer that will work with Matter over Thread. Mui Lab debuted its Matter-ready ""muiPlatform"" that turns smart devices into ""calmer ones,"" which includes a board that turns Amazon's Alexa into a more visual interface.

One device Michelle Mindala-Freeman, vice president of marketing for the Connectivity Standards Alliance, is watching is Schlage's announcement made Tuesday introducing it new smart Wi-Fi deadbolt, which will be among the first to support Apple's latest enhancement to its HomeKit experience with home keys capability.

She says 2022 will be a big year for Matter. There are hundreds of companies involved in both CSA and Matter, and 50 companies have brought through 134 products already, Mindala-Freeman told TechCrunch.

It is expected that CSA will have the certification, specifications, testing tools and SDK released by the middle of the year. This will enable companies to be faster to market with new hardware and innovations and reach a broader consumer audience.

""At a fundamental level, our job at CSA is to eliminate fragmentation and help companies to grow and do it in a way that is highly valuable to consumers,"" Mindala-Freeman said. ""Standards like Matter do that, and we believe it is a rising tide that raises all boats.""

Intel now claims it has the mobile chips to rival Apple's M1, but the tale will be told after the chips ship. Regardless of the outcome, a challenged Intel and Apple are good for the entire industry.

The company announced its new H-series Alder Lake mobile CPUs at CES 2022. The lineup includes the Core i9-12900HK, which Intel touts as the ""the fastest mobile processor. Ever.""

Here's what you should know about Intel's new chips, as well as how its flagship mobile silicon stacks up against Apple's M1 Max.

The 12th-generation Alder Lake CPUs are Intel's first laptop chips to sport its hybrid architecture, which combines high-performance cores and efficient cores based on the company's Atom chips.

All of Intel's new chips are based on the company's ""Intel 7"" fabrication process, which is actually a 10nm process, Ars Technical points out. Intel justifies the name by claiming that its transistor density is similar to a 7nm process, and in any case, it's the first move away from the chipmaker's 14nm process in about six years.

In addition to the hybrid core design that's similar to Apple's, the new chips also support up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports, 96 EUs of Intel graphics, memory support for DDR5, LPDDR5, DDR4, and LPDDR4X, and offerings like Wi-Fi 6E and PCIe 4.0.

Intel did not unveil its entire lineup of Alder Lake chips at CES 2022. Instead, it showed off its most powerful 45W H-series chips. The company is also planning on releasing 9W U-series chips and 28W P-series chips later in the year.

The H-series chips follow the release of Intel's Alder Lake desktop CPUs in 2021 which also did not exactly sip power -- but that's less important in a desktop. The new announcements at CES could indicate that Intel is gearing up to try and take back its crown in the mobile processor space.

Intel's flagship Core i9-12900HK, which is a 14-core chip with six performance cores and eight efficient cores, is said to offer up to 28% faster gaming performance and 44% faster content creation performance compared to its predecessor. The company also says that the 5.0GHz chip can outclass both the AMD Ryzen 5900HX and Apple's M1 Max.

There are some caveats to Intel's own benchmark testing. For one, the Core i9-12900HK appears to outclass Apple's M1 Max at power draws over 35 watts. However, the M1 Max operates at a much lower wattage -- about 20 watts. If Intel's own figures are right, it takes twice the power to deliver 50% more performance than the M1 Max.

And with that power, will come heat. And fan noise.

Batteries in laptops can only get so big, because of FAA regulations, so a larger internal battery isn't an option, really. And, a discrete GPU, if utilized, will draw even more power than Intel's estimates above, and require more heat dissipation.

Intel said it conducted some of its productivity testing for platforms like Adobe Premiere Pro before those apps were optimized for Apple Silicon. Even then, the M1 Max was still neck-and-neck with the Core i9-12900HK in Premiere Pro.

The company aims to first introduce the feature, named ""Ride Pilot,"" as an add-on subscription to an electric SUV that will be revealed later this year.

Ride Pilot is what Volvo is calling an ""unsupervised"" AD feature - meaning the car will be able to drive itself, giving passengers plenty of time to enjoy ""secondary activities like reading, writing, working or socializing,"" according to Volvo. Luminar and Zenseact, in which Volvo owns a majority stake, have been working on building these capabilities since at least March 2021, when the two companies shared plans to combine tech and create a ""holistic autonomous vehicle stack"" that could be offered to other automakers. Nvidia's system-on-a-chip will power Volvo's core compute system.

Volvo is the latest automaker to create a strategy around getting commercial passenger vehicles with autonomous capabilities to market. Tesla has pushed out its misleadingly named ""Autopilot"" and ""Full Self-Driving"" software, which rely solely on cameras and computer vision tech to provide advanced driver assistance features that can handle tasks like autosteering within a clearly marked lane, traffic-aware cruise control, auto lane change, auto park, summon and traffic and stop sign control. Chinese automaker Xpeng is also rolling out its next generation of ADAS called ""Xpilot,"" which relies on lidar, radar and cameras to provide automated navigation assisted driving from point to point based on the route set by the driver.

""The key thing here with Ride Pilot is that it's actually self driving,"" Martin Kristensson, Volvo's VP of digital business, told TechCrunch. ""You don't have to keep your hands on the steering wheel. You don't have to look at the road ahead. You can actually eat your breakfast in the car or read a book or watch a movie and the car will drive itself. We will take liability when the car is driving itself. So I think that in that sense, it is an offer that doesn't exist in the market today.""

Before Ride Pilot goes to market, the software will undergo rigorous verification and testing protocol, which includes validating the technology for safe use on highways in a number of conditions, Volvo says. Initially, Ride Pilot will be available on a limited operational design domain. Specifically, it will only operate on highways that Volvo has validated and at lower speeds.

Customers in California will be the first to experience Ride Pilot before a gradual rollout to other markets, which makes sense given the state's favorable regulatory environment to autonomous testing, sunny weather and accumulation of highways packed with cars. Los Angeles commuters apparently spend an average of 119 hours per year stuck in traffic, time Volvo thinks can be better spent.

Volvo will still need to secure permits for testing its vehicles on public roads in California, but Kristensson says the company is ""in dialogue with relevant regulatory bodies, including the California DMV, to secure all necessary approvals."" So far, the company is only testing Ride Pilot in Sweden with Zenseact, but it expects to receive the necessary permits to begin testing on public roads in California by the middle of the year. The regulation Volvo will need to actually implement this tech on a commercial scale is not yet mature enough for what the industry is offering. For example, California currently has laws to prohibit drivers from using their phones while driving, which might be a snag in Volvo's plans to entice drivers to subscribe to Ride Pilot so they can scroll through Twitter or respond to emails while the car drives itself.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles did not respond to TechCrunch's request for information in time.

Volvo did not share how much the Ride Pilot subscription would cost, nor how much the SUV might sell for, but Kristensson did say the car would be around the same price of the 2022 Volvo XC90, which has a starting price of around $50,000. Whether or not customers choose to add on the software, their vehicles will be built with all of the sensors needed to make AD and ADAS capabilities happen. Chief among those sensors is Luminar's Iris lidar sensor, which is more seamlessly integrated into the roofline of the vehicle rather than attached to the rooftop like a glowing jewel. In addition, the new SUV will come with five radars, eight cameras and 16 ultrasonic sensors.

""Volvo decided to standardize the hardware meaning that all the vehicles, whether people are subscribing to Ride Pilot or not, will have the hardware that's possible to launch this software, and also possible to collect the data that we need to monitor and make sure we're safe and able to launch,"" Zenseact CEO Ödgärd Andersson told TechCrunch. ""So every car will have a basic level of safety, which is like helping you do emergency braking or steering, and that's standard. Now with this new level of technology and the lidar to actually take it to a whole new level, on top of that there's the cruise functionality to assist while you're driving that's taken to a new level because we have better sensing and compute.""

As with Tesla's FSD, the software itself and updates can be sent over-the-air to both users in new markets as well as existing users in order to continuously ensure redundancy.

Volvo hasn't yet shared details about the design of its upcoming electric SUV, but Kristensson said its concept EV revealed in July called ""Concept Recharge,"" which looks a bit like a crossover with a flat floor, a glass ceiling and rear suicide doors, is ""a good indication of what the actual car will look like."" Volvo is partnering with companies like Northvolt, which makes EV batteries, Google and Luminar to build out this EV, as well as future vehicles.

During CES, the automaker also shared plans to implement Qualcomm's Snapdragon digital cockpit infotainment center into the new electric SUV. Volvo also announced on Wednesday more details of its partnership with Google, like an integration with Google Assistant-enabled devices that will allow users to do things like ask Google to warm up their car, as well as enabling YouTube to be downloaded to the vehicles.

""We see that drivers will spend more time in the car not driving, while electrical cars are charging and you're waiting for it to charge, or maybe in a situation with an autonomous vehicle where you're riding and relaxing rather than driving, so we want to enable more digital services in the car,"" said Kristensson.

The suite of digital services that Volvo is building through strategic partnerships give Volvo a chance to build out its subscription model and learn how customers want to interface with these new products.

""We will see a lot of services and experiences coming through to our consumers in the next year that they can actually subscribe to rather than buy it upfront,"" Anne-Mette Nygaard, head of digital consumer products, told TechCrunch. ""So more flexible ownership and more transparency directly with our consumers is the way to go.""","{'uri': 'news.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}",[],https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/75q.TMP4bfzgOXFU29ieHQ--~B/aD0zNjM7dz05NDM7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_350/3898d9bf7b4fb2bc1f4cd32017174c02,0.2941176470588236,eng-7385337,False,0.8156862854957581,0.2941176470588236,379105680,1

Right off the bat, we can see that the upcoming flagship will be powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, which Qualcomm claims is the fastest CPU available for Android-based smartphones. The new chip, which was announced in November, is expected to support always-on cameras and has already made its way into the Chinese market with the Motorola Edge X30. The device will run on the in-house developed OxygenOS 12, built on Android 12.

The flagship will also be Hasselblad-tuned, with a triple camera setup sporting 48, 50 and 8-megapixel shooters housed inside a ceramic bump on the rear end. According to OnePlus, the ceramic camera bump is 13x stronger than glass, so the phone isn't likely to have durability issues. Lau's post also states that the front shooter will be 32-megapixels and that the phone will feature a 120Hz AMOLED display.

The OnePlus 10 Pro will feature a 5,000mAh battery, along with support for wired (80W), wireless (50W) and reverse-wireless charging.

The smartwatch comes with Razer-themed green and black straps and has three themed watch faces included in the software. The ""chroma"" watch face will allow you to set up a colorful theme similar to the lighting on a Razer keyboard.

The two other Razer-themed watch faces are Text, which spells out the time, and an Analogue theme.

Apart from the bands and the watch faces, the Fossil Gen 6 ships with Google's Wear OS 2, with plans to upgrade to Wear OS 3 sometime in mid- to late 2022. The Gen 6 line debuted last summer, with a particular focus on being able to charge its battery from zero to 80% in 30 minutes and its faster Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 Plus chip. The watch also includes GPS, a heart rate sensor, an Sp02 blood oxygen sensor and Bluetooth 5.0 LE connectivity.

The Gen 6 watch will eventually get support for Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, which Fossil said will be coming in the near future. Alexa will be preloaded on the watch, and will be activated when Amazon adds that version of the assistant to Google's app store.

The watch will go on sale Monday with a 44mm black case, starting at $329. The limited edition will only be 1,337 units, because why not. It costs a bit more than the standard Gen 6's starting price of $299 (£279, AU$499).

A Fossil rep told CNET that the Razer collaboration is partially a test to see how a member of the gaming audience would approach the smartwatch, whether as a new customer, an existing customer or someone who would be into the limited-edition element of this smartwatch.

The Razer-themed Gen 6 watch debut comes to CES the same day as Razer's Zephyr Pro face mask, the Enki Pro Hypersense gaming chairs and the Project Sophia gaming desk prototype.

Fossil is also unveiling its Gen 6 collaboration with Skagen Wednesday, called the Falster Gen 6 Smartwatch, in a 41mm case size. The metal bezel on the Falster is slimmer than the Razer's, but in every other way the watch is identical to the other Gen 6 models.

The Skagen smartwatches will come in several colors, with cases in silver, rose gold, charcoal and black. Strap options will be available in stainless-steel mesh, silicone and leather. The Skagen Gen 6 line becomes available Wednesday and will be starting at $295.","{'uri': 'cnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNET'}","[{'uri': 'mike_sorrentino@cnet.com', 'name': 'Mike Sorrentino', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/tPdzwus88ZzRYkJaoIogr8va-SQ=/1200x630/2022/01/03/f61fd200-1355-4630-8aca-f7ab512a32a6/fossilrazer-6.jpg,0.08235294117647052,eng-7386037,False,0.7921568751335144,0.08235294117647052,379105380,1

This panel is at least found in an appreciably thin and light chassis, at 14mm high and 1.3kg in weight. Then again, this has been done through the inclusion of plastic in most areas apart from a metallic hinge. The resulting Book 14 Go contains the Snapdragon 7c processor, which means it also has a SIM card slot for optional, continual 4G/LTE data.

The Book 14 Go is also rated to leverage its light-on-performance Qualcomm platform for a battery life estimated at up to 12 hours between charges. This is done via USB type-C, even if the rate involved is just 25 watts (W).

OnePlus' recently revealed flagship device, the OnePlus 10 Pro, is set to release in China on January 11th, with a more global release following suit at a later date.

While the company only released a teaser image of the phone earlier, similar to how Google teased the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro for months on end, we now how official information about the flagship device's specifications, courtesy of OnePlus co-founder and CEO Pete Lau.

Right off the bat, we can see that the upcoming flagship will be powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, which Qualcomm claims is the fastest CPU available for Android-based smartphones. The new chip, which was announced in November, is expected to support always-on cameras and has already made its way into the Chinese market with the Motorola Edge X30. The device will run on the in-house developed OxygenOS 12, built on Android 12.

The flagship will also be Hasselblad-tuned, with a triple camera setup sporting 48, 50 and 8-megapixel shooters housed inside a ceramic bump on the rear end. According to OnePlus, the ceramic camera bump is 13x stronger than glass, so the phone isn't likely to have durability issues. Lau's post also states that the front shooter will be 32-megapixels and that the phone will feature a 120Hz AMOLED display.

The OnePlus 10 Pro will feature a 5,000mAh battery, along with support for wired (80W), wireless (50W) and reverse-wireless charging.

Other information revealed by Lau includes support for NFC, VoLTE (Voice over LTE), VoWi-Fi (Voice over Wi-Fi) and dual stereo speakers.

The collaboration and future chip would help power a new integration of lightweight, energy-efficient glasses in conjunction with Mesh, Microsoft's upcoming take on the metaverse platform. Using this newly announced custom chip, users will be able to access Microsoft's applications providing the ability to connect over a holographic, virtual space using a multitude of devices, such as virtual reality headsets, tablets, mobile phones and PCs.

In addition, the combination of the chip and Microsoft Mesh will allow users to collaborate over work platforms such as Microsoft Teams using virtual likenesses of themselves.

The Snapdragon Spaces XR development platform will afford users the ability to use spatial mapping so digital objects can be overlaid upon the space. The Spaces XR platform also comes with features such as positional tracking, object recognition and hand tracking, affording the ability to manipulate spaces using hand gestures.

Qualcomm has already tackled both the VR and AR realms using its chips in the past, as the Snapdragon 850 now powers Microsoft's Hololens 2 headset and the Oculus Quest 2 headset, which is powered by the Snapdragon XR2 chip.

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has served three show cause notices to M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited for demand and recovery of duty amounting to Rs. 653 crore for the period 01.04.2017 to 30.06.2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962.

According to an official statement, based upon intelligence that M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited (Xiaomi India) was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, an investigation was initiated by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) against Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.

During the investigation, searches were conducted by the DRI at the premises of Xiaomi India, which led to the recovery of incriminating documents indicating that Xiaomi India was remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., under contractual obligation. Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments.

During the investigations, it further emerged that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.

The investigations conducted by the DRI further showed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in India by importing parts and components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India. The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

Evidence gathered during the investigations by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufactures were including the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 and Customs valuation (determination of value of imported goods) Rules 2007. By not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading Customs duty being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof.","{'uri': 'pragativadi.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pragativadi: Leading Odia Dailly'}",[],https://pragativadi.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/xiomi.jpg,0.2705882352941176,eng-7385274,False,0.9764705896377563,0.2705882352941176,379104540,2

If you thought there was no more room for televisions to improve, think again. At CES 2022, TV makers have outdone themselves and taken giant leaps with new technologies such as MicroLED. Though LG and Samsung grabbed the lion's share of headlines with their refreshed range of televisions, it was Sony that claimed the prime spotlight with the world's first QD-OLED TV. The rest of the brands, on the other hand, focused more on offering more at less. TCL, more specifically, wants to sell you a monstrous 98-inch 4K TV for a cool $8,000.

Sony dropped the world's first Quantum Dot OLED TV

Sony beat LG and Samsung to launch the first consumer Quantum Dot OLED TV. Jargon aside, this technology -- developed, in fact, by Samsung Electronics -- morphs the best of OLED and quantum dot technology to produce unparalleled picture quality, with perfect blacks and higher brightness.

Although Sony has yet to announce the pricing and availability of its QD-OLED televisions, it did share a handful of specs. They'll be available in 65-inch and 55-inch sizes at 4K resolution and come equipped with top-of-the-line hardware, including built-in cable management, variable refresh rate, and a pair of HDMI 2.1 ports.

LG 2022 OLED TVs get brighter, bigger, and ... smaller?

LG is storming the CES show floor with a gargantuan 97-inch OLED television and teased a 136-inch 4K HDR MicroLED TV. Although these display technologies continue to remain best in class, it's the more practical additions that caught most people's eyes. Its most premium 4K OLED TVs, for instance, can now sustain higher brightness for longer periods without negative effects, thanks to a refreshed thermal management system.

LG is also working on bringing OLED screens to the masses. It introduced a new 42-inch variant of the high-end C-Series OLED TV, which has the potential to become a crowd favorite among both general TV enthusiasts and gamers.

Samsung's new TVs bring NFTs to life

Samsung's TVs got bigger, brighter, and its MicroLED displays went ""bezel-free"" at CES. But since 2021 itself was a groundbreaking year for Samsung, it didn't feel the need to do much on the hardware front this time. Instead, CES 2022 was all about software for Samsung's TV division,.

For starters, Samsung revamped its televisions' home screen to ""put all streaming service content into one, easy-to-browse place."" There's also a new ""Watch Together"" feature that allows you to plug in a camera or your phone to chat while watching content with your friends and family remotely. Samsung is also bringing NFTs to your living room, and says it will soon let you ""browse, purchase, and display your favorite art -- all in one place.""

Samsung's weird new pivoting projector

Samsung's new Freestyle projector can do much more than just project movies. For $900, it features a LED swiveling display that produces images in sizes from 30 to 100 inches -- but that's not all. The translucent lens cap can turn your room into a visual light show or create mood lighting to match whatever music you're playing.

TCL's giant 98-inch 4K TV hits CES -- and stores -- for under $8,000

If you don't intend to pay ungodly sums of money (tens of thousands of dollars) for LG's and Samsung's new giant MicroLED displays, TCL's latest 98-inch 4K QLED Google TV could be right up your alley. For a little over $7,500, it gets you a 4K panel, HDR, 144Hz refresh rate, and of course, a whole lot of screen.

Computing

Computers turned a new chapter at CES 2022 as well. Whether it's Dell embracing the Touch Bar that Apple killed last year or Intel's claim for the chip crown, there were plenty of surprises and announcements to get excited about. The show has had its fair share of weirdness, too, with Samsung's rotating cockpit of monitor madness and TP-Link's motorized router.

Dell revives the Touch Bar

Dell pushed the envelope for how slim its Ultrabook can be with the XPS 13 Plus, but that, unfortunately, meant some unexpected compromises. The XPS 13 Plus' keyboard has no space between keys and minimal travel. The touchpad isn't outlined either and responds with haptic feedback. And function row has been swapped out for a Touch Bar-like capacitive touch strip. It's a radical overhaul -- but will it work? We'll have to wait to find out.

A router that follows you

You can easily mistake TP-Link's new router for a compact drone. The latest Archer AXE200 Omni router has four antennas at the top that automatically fold out and swivel to grab the best possible signal for your devices. It's compatible with the new Wi-Fi 6E technology and offers triband speed, with a 6Ghz band joining the existing 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz ones.

Intel thinks it has Apple's chips beat

Intel is catching up with Apple's silicon prowess. Its new 12th-gen chips are up to 40 percent faster than the previous generation mobile processor. But most importantly, the silicon maker claims the top-of-the-line i9 processor has ""superior performance"" compared to Apple's M1 Max. Intel's new mobile processors are expected to be available later this year.

Lenovo's ThinkPad line of laptops gets 'progressive'

Lenovo is rolling out a huge visual refresh for its ThinkPad laptops to target the younger boardroom members. The new Z-Series ThinkPad notebooks come with a sleek exterior and will go on sale in funky colors. They skip Intel and run on AMD's latest Ryzen Pro processors, boast an edge-to-edge 16:10 screen with a protruding housing for the 1080p webcam, and feature the tiny red TrackPoint.

Asus ROG Flow Z13 is a beefed-up Windows tablet for gamers

Asus' new Windows gaming tablet, the ROG Flow Z13, manages to cram more in a 12mm-thick enclosure than you'd think. You can configure it with Intel's Core i9-12900H 45-watt processor and Nvidia's RTX 3050 Ti or connect it to an external GPU via a proprietary port. It has a 13.4-inch display, a kickstand, and a detachable keyboard with per-key RGB backlighting.

Samsung ARK is a rotating cockpit of monitor madness

You have to see the Samsung Odyssey Ark to believe it exists. It's the biggest and curviest monitor ever with a 55-inch screen you can even flip vertically to be completely consumed by it. The screen size is adaptable, which means you can adjust it to fit whatever game or program you're using, and there's a dedicated dial controller to manage its lighting and interface.

Acer Swift X features Intel's most powerful discrete GPU yet

Acer is back with an annual upgrade for its Swift X notebook. Its 16-inch model sports Intel's first competitive discrete GPU, known as Intel Arc graphics. Other than that, they carry standard upgrades, including 2K screens, Windows 11, plenty of ports, and Intel's 12th Gen Intel Core processors.

Mobile

CES isn't a mobile-first event -- that comes later in the year at Mobile World Congress. However, there were still a ton of new announcements at CES for improved computing on the go.

Qualcomm and Microsoft team up to build AR chips

The augmented reality arms race is on and Microsoft doesn't want to be left behind. It's partnering with Qualcomm to develop a new, customized Snapdragon augmented reality chip for powering AR glasses within Microsoft's ecosystems. The alliance, the two giants promise, will lead to ""next-generation, power-efficient, very lightweight AR glasses.""

Samsung's new Galaxy S21 FE is an affordable flagship phone

CES is Samsung's display division's territory, not mobile. Yet, the latter still managed to dominate the headlines with the release of the new Galaxy S21 FE smartphone. In spite of the $699 price, the Galaxy S21 FE sports top-of-the-line specs, including a variable refresh rate, Snapdragon 888 chipset, a total of four cameras, and a 4,500mAh battery.

Garmin Vivomove Sport is a fashionable smartwatch with a hidden screen

Garmin is moving beyond the fitness niche and wants to take a shot at the mainstream smartwatch market. Its new Vivomove Sport watch, at first glance, looks like a standard timepiece but hidden underneath its analog hands is a touchscreen display. It has all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a Garmin wearable, such as the ability to track blood oxygen levels, sleep, and more.

TCL's NXTWEAR AIR wearable display is like a cinema on your face

The second iteration of TCL's display glasses no longer look like something you'd be embarrassed to wear in public. Along with a more normal sunglasses design, the new NxtWear Air are also 30 percent lighter and have a pair of 1080p Micro OLED displays that give the effect of viewing a 140-inch screen from about 13 feet away. TCL's glasses are only meant to be cinema for your face with in-built speakers and don't have any AR or VR abilities.

Smart Home

One of the key themes of CES 2022 is the focus on simplifying the smart home experience. Appliances have come a long way, but setting up a smart home from scratch and dealing with a gazillion standards and hubs is nothing short of a nightmare. A few companies have set their sights on fixing that, from Arlo to Samsung.

Arlo's security system makes managing sensors a breeze

Arlo's new security system solves one of the biggest pain points of monitoring your home: Proprietary sensors. Instead, Arlo's signature new feature is an all-in-one multi-sensor that you can link to any of eight different functions. It can recognize motion, windows being opened, water leaks, smoke alarms, and more.

Whirlpool's smart oven now doubles as an air fryer

Whirlpool has a new software update for its range of smart ovens, which brings not just a feature, but pretty much adds an entirely new appliance to the oven. The company's Smart Slide-in Gas and Electric Ranges, as well as the Smart Single, Double, and Combination Wall Ovens, can now act as air fryers. All you need to buy is an air fry basket that will be available sometime in early 2022.

A light bulb that tracks your sleep and heart rate

Sengled's latest smart light bulb packs much more than what meets the eye. With a groundbreaking new radar technology, it can measure several vital signs of anyone within range -- including sleep quality stats, heart rate, and body temperature. On top of that, it can tell when someone has fallen within a room and automatically call for help.

Schlage's smart deadbolt lets you unlock doors with a tap of your watch

Schlage has announced the first lock with support for Apple's Home Key. Introduced with iOS 15, the functionality allows you to store a digital key in your phone or watch and lock or unlock doors with just a tap. Called the Schlage Encode Plus, it will hit the shelves in spring 2022 for $300.

Talk to Panasonic's smart microwave via Alexa

Panasonic is the latest appliance maker to let you cook popcorn by talking to Alexa. Its latest Smart Inverter Countertop Microwave Oven works with Amazon's voice assistant. Once you set it up, you can simply talk to the microwave to remotely perform over 100 functions.

New alliance seeks to simplify setting up a smart home

The Achilles' heel of investing in a smart home is that you're stuck within one particular company's walled garden. A handful of smart home companies have joined hands to solve that and enable interoperability across appliances. Called the Home Connectivity Alliance, it involves American Standard Air Conditioning and Heating, Arcelik, The Electrolux Group, Haier, GE Appliances, Samsung Electronics, and Trane Residential.

Automotive

It wouldn't be CES without the next generation of automobile tech, and we're glad to report that this year is no exception. From more giants throwing hats in the ring to a high-speed autonomous car race, CES 2022 has got it all.

Sony gets serious about electric cars

Sony announced not just a product, but a new subsection of the company that will focus on building commercial electric vehicles: Sony Mobility. In addition to the Sony Vision-S sedan it showcased last year, the electronics giant took the wraps off a new SUV prototype model this time around called the Sony Vision-S SUV. Safety was the centerpiece of Sony's pitch. ""A total of 40 sensors are installed inside and outside of the vehicle to monitor safety,"" President and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said.

Mercedes' next-gen electric car can go 1,000km in one charge

It's hard to take our eyes off Mercedes' handsome new Vision EQXX concept car. But it's what's inside that matters more. The automobile company says it's the longest-range electric vehicle, capable of going about 621 miles on a single charge. The efficiency, as per Mercedes, comes from improved aerodynamics and a lightweight design instead of just a bulkier battery.

CES is hosting a high-speed autonomous car race this year

On January 7, a pack of race cars will hit the Las Vegas Motor Speedway with speeds touching 180 miles per hour -- and not a single one of them will have a human driver at the wheel. They'll be competing in the Indy Autonomous Challenge, where university teams from around the world put their algorithms to the test. The event will be livestreamed and you can watch it either on the official website or Twitch.

GM set to unveil Chevy Silverado EV line

GM revealed the Chevy Silverado EV line of pickup trucks. Though much has been kept under the wraps so far, it will likely share the design of the latest non-EV Silverado models. It could also have a similar platform as the latest Hummer EV, which means up to 1,000 horsepower and 400 miles of range.

Gaming

The rise of video games, especially during the pandemic lockdowns, has turned the CES show floor into a gaming gear battleground. At CES 2022, gaming processors hit new performance heights (and got cheaper), monitors adapted next-gen tech for better split-second reactions, and laptops somehow gained more powerful internals in the same, thin form factor.

Nvidia's $249 GPU

Thanks to Nvidia, building high-end gaming PCs will no longer break the bank. Its new RTX 3050 starts at just $249 and offers everything you'd require to play most games.

Alienware's Concept Nyx puts a dedicated game streaming server in your house

Alienware has a bizarre new idea for a house full of gamers. Its Concept Nyx imagines a dedicated game streaming server in your home that would let you stream multiple games on any screen you want. So say you want to boot up Forza on your television and your sibling wants Uncharted on their monitor, you wouldn't need to buy two computers. Nyx would theoretically allow you both to stream your own games separately.

Now in her mid-70s, the longtime Ramona resident has spent 30 years rescuing animals, mostly for the nonprofit Help for the Homeless Pets.

Cannon, the mother of three grown children, said she got involved in the organization after meeting its founder Bea Hoskins. Cannon was working at Ramona Animal Hospital when Hoskins brought in a Newfoundland dog for a check-up.

""I loved it and adopted it,"" said Cannon, who discovered she had a lot in common with Hoskins and formed a friendship that has lasted 30 years. ""Bea puts a lot of money and effort into the animals she takes in and she takes in mostly special needs dogs, smaller ones.""

Hoskins said the dog was one of two Newfoundlands that were dumped out of a van in front of her while she was picking pomegranates on a property off Highland Valley Road.

""She's a true compassionate, caring friend who has never let me down,"" Hoskins said of Cannon. ""She's somebody you can count on through the worst of times. We've always leaned on each other's shoulders. She's somebody that you don't find every day.""

Along with rescuing animals in Ramona and neighboring communities, Hoskins has rescued dogs and cats as far away as Siberia. Cannon helped rescue strays in Mexico. Sometimes the special needs dogs that have been injured or abused are brought to the United States.

But these days Cannon mostly gathers supplies because of health issues.

Hoskins said Cannon gets credit, along with the other volunteers, for working tirelessly without pay.

""Every bit of money that we have all goes to the animals,"" said Hoskins, who formed Ramona-based Help for the Homeless Pets in 1993. ""We've never had hired employees.""

Cannon said she has always had an affinity for animals even though her parents never had more than one small dog. As a girl, she played with a farm set instead of dolls.

""It was always in my blood from the beginning even though I was not raised that way,"" she said.

By the time Cannon met Hoskins she had already been living in Ramona for a decade with her husband, Jerry. While the couple were building their house in Ramona, they acquired a number of animals, including horses, pigs, sheep and chickens. By the time their house was built two years later, they had a whole farm set up.

""The animals just kept multiplying and when we moved here onto four acres we ended up taking in things people didn't want anymore,"" Cannon said. ""My husband called them drive-bys. People would drop off animals.

""We had domestic animals and we did wildlife rescues for a while and had some exotics. Our barn was always full and we had a variety of stuff. I had a lot of interesting wild animals, including skunks and raccoons. These are animals that just got better and were mostly released.""

As their menagerie grew, local school children would visit her house for lessons about her animals. Cannon would teach them vocabulary words, such as the difference between nocturnal and diurnal, and also how to care for animals and be responsible pet owners.

Hoskins said she feels blessed that she met Cannon and a few others who really care about animals and can be counted on to help. Even if it means getting up in the middle of the night to set a live trap for an animal that is lost or abandoned.

""The rewards are when these animals recuperate and trust people again,"" Hoskins said. ""Not all of them do. If we can find loving homes for them, that's the rewarding part. Those are the highlights.""

For a decade, Cannon also helped the San Diego Humane Society bring animals to senior care homes. Cannon would tell the seniors how she acquired the animals and how she cared for them.

When her daughter, Lisa, was 11 years old and involved in a 4-H Club, she wanted to learn to raised guide dog puppies. As Cannon acquired knowledge about guide dog training, she became a leader. Through Guide Dogs for the Blind, Inc. in San Rafael, Cannon would take dog owners to stores and other places to teach them how to get the dogs to behave in public.

She volunteered with Guide Dogs for the Blind for 18 years. Lisa also continued raising dogs with her husband after she married, and combined the family raised over 20 guide dogs.

Aside from her work with animals, Cannon has helped with other causes, too. One was providing respite care to caretakers of terminally ill patients through the Elizabeth Hospice. Cannon said her 14 years volunteering with Elizabeth Hospice was a rewarding experience.

One day she met a woman in the grocery store checkout line who told her about the organization Heart to Heart and its mission of helping people in Romania who had lost homes and jobs and were without food and clothes.

Cannon held a clothing drive, enlisting local schools that organized contests to see who could turn in the most clothes.

""The children would be dumping out last year's wardrobe anyway,"" Cannon recalled. ""Over a month we collected the clothes and separated them into boys and girls clothes, tops and bottoms, and approximate sizes. We put them in banana boxes I kept collecting at grocery stores.""

Eventually, Cannon said they had enough clothes to fill a large storage unit. With financial help from the local wireless technology firm Qualcomm, they put the clothes into a shipping container and had them shipped to Romania.

""I had a lot of wonderful opportunities to live a life of love and I'm blessed to have come across those things,"" said Cannon, noting that the First Congregational Church of Ramona she attends has a motto to live a life of love. ""And that's my mission statement for being who I am, too. It fits us perfectly.""

Over the years, Cannon said she parted ways with many animals, but she still has four pigs, a couple goats and alpacas, a llama, a deer, a miniature horse and an emu in addition to some dogs and cats.

""If I was young and could live my life over, that's all I would do, is keep rescuing animals needing a home,"" she said, adding that she appreciates the help she gets from her husband. ""That's my most important reason for being is helping animals and we've done a lot of that over the years.""

How to help

Anyone who wants to assist Help for the Homeless Pets, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, can send donations to P.O. Box 1406, Ramona, CA 92065.

Animal adoptions are arranged in conjunction with the AmazingDogs.org website at least twice a month at the Poway PetCoach store and at a private residence in Carlsbad, Hoskins said. Adoption event schedules are posted on the website.

The company offered us a little peek at its 2022 portfolio at the CES show floor, and we even got to play around with some of the devices. You can find our initial hands-on impressions on the following pages, but before we get to that - a quick recap of the devices TCL decided to showcase.

First and foremost, there is the new TCL 30 series of mobile phones, which will, in typical TCL fashion, first be offered as US carrier exclusives. TCL has 30-series phones ready to launch in Europe, but they will be unveiled at the MWC. In particular, TCL showed us the 30 V 5G and 30 XE 5G, which are kicking off the TCL 30 series, with more devices expected to join the family later this year. Both are well-rounded mid-range offers, with some of their highlights including a 90Hz refresh rate on the 30 XE 5G and a 50MP main camera and mmWave support on the TCL 30 V 5G.

Beyond the TCL 30 pair of phones, we also spotted an early clamshell foldable prototype on the show floor. Officially still going by its internal name - the Project Chicago foldable could actually end up being called the TCL Flex V. Naturally, official details are still sparse and probably subject to change, but TCL did bring along an actually functioning prototype, which we will offer our impressions on.

Last, but not least, we'll also be discussing the TCL NxtPaper 10s tablet. It was also available at the event for us to check out.

Beyond these devices, TCL also unveiled a slew of other hardware. In no particular order, these include a few other regular tablets - the TCL TAB 8 4G and TCL TAB 10L and a trio of tablets designed for children - the new TCL TKEE series: TCL TKEE MINI, MID, and MAX. Six in total, by our count. There is also the rather interesting TCL NxtPaper full-color e-reader, with a special LCD panel with no backlight.

The extensive list of new TCL devices also includes the company's first laptop - the TCL Book 14 GO, running on a Qualcomm ARM chip. Also, a few pieces of smart eyewear - the TCL NXTWEAR AIR, HXTWEAR Pro and TCL XR Glasses. If that wasn't enough, there are also the TCL LINKHUB 5G router and a portable 4G solution - the LINKZONE LTE Cat4 Mobile Wi-Fi.","{'uri': 'gsmarena.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'GSM Arena'}",[],https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/reviews/22/tcl-ces-2022-hands-on/-728x314/gsmarena_001.jpg,0.2549019607843137,eng-7382870,False,0.8627451062202454,0.2549019607843137,379103760,1

You'll be able to control certain functions remotely via Google Assistant. You might tell your phone to lock the doors or ask a smart speaker to start warming up your car as you're getting ready to leave home.

Two-factor authentication is needed for ""more sensitive commands,"" like unlocking the doors. You can also learn info related to your car through Google Assistant.

More features will be added later, such as the option to schedule charging. Volvo will roll out Google Home integration in the coming months. To use it, you'll need an Android-powered infotainment system that's connected to the Volvo Cars app and a Google Assistant-enabled device.

It's not the first time we've seen integration with connected home platforms in cars. GM and BMW owners can control smart home devices from vehicles with built-in Alexa, while Samsung and Google brought a SmartThings dashboard to some models with Android Auto. Still, Google Home is one of the more prominent connected home platforms around. If you have a smart speaker with Google Assistant enabled, these features might come in useful.

In addition, YouTube will be the first video streaming service on Volvo's infotainment system. You'll be able to download the app from the Play Store. The automaker offers unlimited data in certain markets, so you might be able to watch as many videos as you like without worrying about busting your data allowance.

For safety reasons, you'll only be able to watch YouTube videos on the screen when the car's stationary. That will ensure Volvo avoids the kind of controversy Tesla was embroiled in recently, when it emerged that games were playable on the infotainment system while a car was moving. The company said it would disable that option after the NHTSA said it was looking into the matter.

Other apps that Volvo owners will soon be able to download to their infotainment system include navigation apps Sygic and Flitsmeister; charging apps ChargePoint and Plugshare; and parking services SpotHero and ParkWhiz.

Earlier this week, Volvo announced it will use Qualcomm's car chipsets to power the infotainment systems in Polestar 3 and its upcoming electric EV.

As more vehicles go electric and automakers evolve into software developers, we can only expect to see more plays directed at turning cars into connected devices.

One exemplar of this phenomenon is Volvo Cars, which will launch a direct integration with the Google Home ecosystem in the coming months, both Volvo and Google announced on Wednesday. The integration should allow car owners to turn their car on and off, control the temperature and get car information like battery life by issuing voice commands to Google Assistant-enabled home and mobile devices. Once customers pair their Volvo car to their Google account, they also can talk directly to Google while in their car.

This feature will be available in the United States and in European markets, like Sweden, Norway, Germany, Italy, France and Spain, with others soon to follow, according to Google.

In addition, because newer Volvo car models have Google built-in, they will soon be able to serve as a platform on which to download YouTube, thus enabling video streaming in cars, according to the automaker. YouTube will be available via Qualcomm's Snapdragon digital cockpit infotainment system, which Volvo announced would be implemented into its upcoming electric SUV. The partnership with Google is part of a larger move by Volvo to facilitate more digital services and keep passengers entertained, particularly as it prepares to introduce Ride Pilot, its new ""unsupervised"" autonomous driving feature that is expected to fully self-drive Volvo's upcoming electric SUV on highways to start, allowing drivers to be completely hands-free for whatever other activities they'd rather be doing than holding onto a steering wheel.

""Allowing our customers to watch videos while charging or when waiting to pick up their children from school is part of our promise to make their lives better and more enjoyable,"" said Henrik Green, chief product officer at Volvo Cars, in a statement. ""With YouTube and other major streaming services coming soon, our customers can enjoy their charging break instead of seeing it as just a hassle -- making electric car ownership that bit easier.""

Google isn't stopping with Volvo. In December, the tech giant unveiled its digital car key, which enables users to lock, unlock and even start compatible BMW cars from 2020, 2021 and 2022 through select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones. On Wednesday, Google said users later this year will be able to utilize the ultra-wideband digital car key to both unlock their vehicle without taking their phone out of their pocket, as well as share the key with others. The feature will be available in multiple markets across Europe, Asia, North America and parts of Africa, as well as Russia, New Zealand and Australia.","{'uri': 'finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

The moves include a new computer vision processor called the Snapdragon Ride Vision System, which the company says will deliver advanced driver assistance via onboard cameras beginning in 2024.

The San Diego firm's new leading-edge chip will square off against Intel's Mobileye, which currently dominates machine vision technology used in cars. Mobileye announced its own new chip at CES to help enable autonomous driving in partnership with Volkswagen and Ford.

Qualcomm also unveiled digital cockpit/infotainment deals with Volvo, Honda and Renault to bring onboard connectivity, high-tech dashboards and entertainment systems to vehicle models as soon as this year.

""We are always going to be the company focused on mobile, but there is more to Qualcomm,"" Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said at a Tuesday news conference at CES, previously known as the Consumer Electronics Show. ""Car companies, many of them now, are tech companies. Technology assets have become extremely important.""

Automakers have embraced technology, not only to make vehicles safer but also to potentially enable new revenue streams, such as from subscriptions for onboard services.

Qualcomm's chip sales to automakers reached $1 billion last year -- mostly from connectivity and infotainment systems. It forecasts auto revenue to climb to $3.5 billion annually in five years.

The company currently has a $13-billion order pipeline for automotive technology, including for 4G/5G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, audio, rear-seat video and digital dashboards -- as well as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies.

BMW and General Motors are Qualcomm's main customers, but it sells to several other carmakers, including Audi, Chrysler, Hyundai and Lexus.

With the new Snapdragon Ride Vision System, Qualcomm isn't targeting full driverless capabilities, known as Level 4 autonomy, at least for now.

Instead, it's steering toward driver assistance camera systems that help motorists without taking complete control. It aims to make the technology available across all vehicle price ranges, Amon said, from entry level to luxury.

""When we think about ADAS, we think the real opportunity is to attach Level 2 and Level 3 to every car,"" Amon said. ""It can become as pervasive as anti-lock braking systems and airbags.

""We are working on full autonomy as well,"" he said. ""We know that has more regulatory challenges and needs more time to mature. But the opportunity to do Level 2 and Level 3 as an assisted solution to the driver is real and is one that can really scale.""

Last year, Qualcomm joined with private firm SW Partners to acquire Swedish auto technology firm Veoneer for $4.5 billion. The complex deal calls for Qualcomm to retain Veoneer's Arriver autonomous driving software stack, while SW Partners will sell off the rest of Veoneer's remaining auto sensor businesses.

Arriver software is included in the Snapdragon Ride Vision System.

With Volvo, Qualcomm inked a deal to supply Snapdragon Cockpit technologies in upcoming fully electric SUVs.

The first vehicles are slated to hit the market later this year. Working with Google's Android automotive operating system, the SUVs will feature hands-free help from Google Assistant and navigation with Google Maps, among other things.

Honda will begin using Qualcomm's chips in models expected to be available in the second half of this year in the U.S. and globally in 2023.

Renault Group also plans to plug in Qualcomm's technologies but didn't reveal when vehicles would be available.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a0dd957/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2F28%2F99e85ae6403c943bcda3fe44b846%2Fsnapdragon-digital-cockpit.jpg,0.2784313725490195,eng-7383748,False,0.6549019813537598,0.2784313725490195,379103340,7

You can skip our comprehensive of these companies, and go directly to 5 Metaverse Stocks to Invest In.

The advent of technology has created new industries and transformed our daily lives in a previously unthought manner. The transistor, which represents the basic block of computing, has been shrunk to microscopic dimensions, resulting in a vast growth of computing power that has enabled new technologies to take root. Additionally, advances in manufacturing technology have enabled companies to design, build, and produce gadgets that would seem like science fiction to humans living just a century ago.

Two such technologies are augmented and virtual realities, both of which serve to expand the way an ordinary user can interact with others and with technology products. Some use cases for AR and VR include video games and simulations, with both allowing users to immerse themselves in a virtual technological environment.

Another use case for AR and VR headsets is what is dubbed as a metaverse. A metaverse, for the uninitiated, is a three-dimensional virtual online environment that allows users to 'enter' a fully virtual social network to 'live' their lives in it. Derived from a combination of 'meta' and universe', a metaverse also includes virtual interaction with physical objects and digital transactions.

Despite being only recently popularized, the metaverse industry is believed to be on a strong growth trajectory by several research firms. For instance, a recent report from Reports and Data outlined that the metaverse industry is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44.1% between 2021 and 2028 to stand at a whopping $872 billion at the end of the forecast period. Another report, this time from Brandessence Market Research, outlined a similar CAGR of 44.8% to project a value of $596 billion by the end of 2027.

Owing to these optimistic projections and its nascent nature, large and small players in the broader technology space have their eyes set on the metaverse industry. Some of the big players that are developing products to either allow users the metaverse experience or create products that enable the vast amount of computing power required to create the virtual extension of physical reality are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc.

The company aims to first introduce the feature, named ""Ride Pilot,"" as an add-on subscription to an electric SUV that will be revealed later this year.

Ride Pilot is what Volvo is calling an ""unsupervised"" AD feature - meaning the car will be able to drive itself, giving passengers plenty of time to enjoy ""secondary activities like reading, writing, working or socializing,"" according to Volvo. Luminar and Zenseact, in which Volvo owns a majority stake, have been working on building these capabilities since at least March 2021, when the two companies shared plans to combine tech and create a ""holistic autonomous vehicle stack"" that could be offered to other automakers. Nvidia's system-on-a-chip will power Volvo's core compute system.

Volvo is the latest automaker to create a strategy around getting commercial passenger vehicles with autonomous capabilities to market. Tesla has pushed out its misleadingly named ""Autopilot"" and ""Full Self-Driving"" software, which rely solely on cameras and computer vision tech to provide advanced driver assistance features that can handle tasks like autosteering within a clearly marked lane, traffic-aware cruise control, auto lane change, auto park, summon and traffic and stop sign control. Chinese automaker Xpeng is also rolling out its next generation of ADAS called ""Xpilot,"" which relies on lidar, radar and cameras to provide automated navigation assisted driving from point to point based on the route set by the driver.

""The key thing here with Ride Pilot is that it's actually self driving,"" Martin Kristensson, Volvo's VP of digital business, told TechCrunch. ""You don't have to keep your hands on the steering wheel. You don't have to look at the road ahead. You can actually eat your breakfast in the car or read a book or watch a movie and the car will drive itself. We will take liability when the car is driving itself. So I think that in that sense, it is an offer that doesn't exist in the market today.""

Before Ride Pilot goes to market, the software will undergo rigorous verification and testing protocol, which includes validating the technology for safe use on highways in a number of conditions, Volvo says. Initially, Ride Pilot will be available on a limited operational design domain. Specifically, it will only operate on highways that Volvo has validated and at lower speeds.

Customers in California will be the first to experience Ride Pilot before a gradual rollout to other markets, which makes sense given the state's favorable regulatory environment to autonomous testing, sunny weather and accumulation of highways packed with cars. Los Angeles commuters apparently spend an average of 119 hours per year stuck in traffic, time Volvo thinks can be better spent.

Volvo will still need to secure permits for testing its vehicles on public roads in California, but Kristensson says the company is ""in dialogue with relevant regulatory bodies, including the California DMV, to secure all necessary approvals."" So far, the company is only testing Ride Pilot in Sweden with Zenseact, but it expects to receive the necessary permits to begin testing on public roads in California by the middle of the year. The regulation Volvo will need to actually implement this tech on a commercial scale is not yet mature enough for what the industry is offering. For example, California currently has laws to prohibit drivers from using their phones while driving, which might be a snag in Volvo's plans to entice drivers to subscribe to Ride Pilot so they can scroll through Twitter or respond to emails while the car drives itself.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles did not respond to TechCrunch's request for information in time.

Volvo did not share how much the Ride Pilot subscription would cost, nor how much the SUV might sell for, but Kristensson did say the car would be around the same price of the 2022 Volvo XC90, which has a starting price of around $50,000. Whether or not customers choose to add on the software, their vehicles will be built with all of the sensors needed to make AD and ADAS capabilities happen. Chief among those sensors is Luminar's Iris lidar sensor, which is more seamlessly integrated into the roofline of the vehicle rather than attached to the rooftop like a glowing jewel. In addition, the new SUV will come with five radars, eight cameras and 16 ultrasonic sensors.

""Volvo decided to standardize the hardware meaning that all the vehicles, whether people are subscribing to Ride Pilot or not, will have the hardware that's possible to launch this software, and also possible to collect the data that we need to monitor and make sure we're safe and able to launch,"" Zenseact CEO Ödgärd Andersson told TechCrunch. ""So every car will have a basic level of safety, which is like helping you do emergency braking or steering, and that's standard. Now with this new level of technology and the lidar to actually take it to a whole new level, on top of that there's the cruise functionality to assist while you're driving that's taken to a new level because we have better sensing and compute.""

As with Tesla's FSD, the software itself and updates can be sent over-the-air to both users in new markets as well as existing users in order to continuously ensure redundancy.

Volvo hasn't yet shared details about the design of its upcoming electric SUV, but Kristensson said its concept EV revealed in July called ""Concept Recharge,"" which looks a bit like a crossover with a flat floor, a glass ceiling and rear suicide doors, is ""a good indication of what the actual car will look like."" Volvo is partnering with companies like Northvolt, which makes EV batteries, Google and Luminar to build out this EV, as well as future vehicles.

During CES, the automaker also shared plans to implement Qualcomm's Snapdragon digital cockpit infotainment center into the new electric SUV. Volvo also announced on Wednesday more details of its partnership with Google, like an integration with Google Assistant-enabled devices that will allow users to do things like ask Google to warm up their car, as well as enabling YouTube to be downloaded to the vehicles.

""We see that drivers will spend more time in the car not driving, while electrical cars are charging and you're waiting for it to charge, or maybe in a situation with an autonomous vehicle where you're riding and relaxing rather than driving, so we want to enable more digital services in the car,"" said Kristensson.

The suite of digital services that Volvo is building through strategic partnerships give Volvo a chance to build out its subscription model and learn how customers want to interface with these new products.

""We will see a lot of services and experiences coming through to our consumers in the next year that they can actually subscribe to rather than buy it upfront,"" Anne-Mette Nygaard, head of digital consumer products, told TechCrunch. ""So more flexible ownership and more transparency directly with our consumers is the way to go.""","{'uri': 'techcrunch.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechCrunch'}",[],https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?w=764,0.2941176470588236,,True,0.5960784554481506,0.2941176470588236,379103100,1

The continent-wide STOXX 600 index rose 0.1% to 494.35 points, its third consecutive record closing high.

But a recent rally appeared to be losing traction, amid concerns over the omicron coronavirus variant, rising interest rates and mixed economic data.

The European automobile subindex was the best performer, jumping 2.7% to a record high as investors expected production to roar back from a semiconductor shortage, with car sales also likely to improve.

Germany's BMW added 2.2% after it achieved record sales from its BMW brand in 2021.

But JPMorgan took a cautious stance for the sector in 2022, citing consumer uncertainty over electric vehicles in Europe.

""We... see a sharper recovery in 2H22 as additional chip capacity comes online,"" analysts at the investment bank wrote. The bank is also overweight on automakers such as Daimler and Renault, as well as tyremakers Michelin and Nokian.

Renault jumped 5.3% to the top of France's CAC 40 after Qualcomm announced deals to supply chips to automakers including the French carmaker.

Mining stocks rose 1.6%, tracking stronger commodity prices as investors bet that demand would recover from a COVID-induced lull.

Other economically-exposed sectors also gained, with banks up 0.2% on expectations of higher interest rates.

Technology stocks fell 0.5% as the prospect of higher rates made the sector appear less attractive.

""There are wobbles in the global equity markets on the back of higher back-end U.S. Treasury yields and concerns about the Chinese tech sector,"" Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, said.

""We should see the fear ebb to leave us with the shape of a reality that is less clear cut than post COVID-19 shock.""

Data also painted a mixed picture of the euro zone economy, as a survey showed a recovery faltered in December due to a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.

Among other movers, Nestle slipped 2.7%, and was among the top drags on the STOXX 600 after Jefferies downgraded the firm on expectations that its margins would remain under pressure from commodity cost inflation.

Valneva fell for the seventh consecutive day amid uncertainty over its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

OnePlus has yet to confirm the phone's display size or resolution, though rumors suggest it will remain at 6.7 inches. The company confirmed on Tuesday that it will have a 120Hz refresh rate.

As for charging, the phone will support 80-watt wired fast charging and 50-watt wireless charging using OnePlus' respective SuperVOOC and AirVOOC accessories. The OnePlus 9 Pro supported 50-watt fast wireless charging, but its wired charging was capped at 65 watts, which brought its smaller 4,500-mAh battery from 1% to 100% in 29 minutes.

There will also be reverse wireless charging, but as with so many other aspects of this device, its speed remains a mystery. Pricing for the phone isn't known, either.

* European auto and auto parts index hits record high

* Sector has gained 33% in one year

* BofA expects light vehicles sales to increase by 10%

* Europe auto sector trades at 7x forward earnings, U.S. 42x

LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - European automobile stocks rose more than 2% to a record high on Wednesday as investors turned increasingly bullish on the sector on growing expectations for stronger car sales in 2022.

Investors' interest in car stocks across the region has ignited over the past few months with Europe's auto and auto parts index up more than 8% this week alone, surpassing a previous record high in November.

The sector has gained 33% in a year, outperforming the pan-European index, which has gained 23% over the same period.

After carmakers had to deal with high inventories over the past two years caused by a pandemic-induced slowdown in sales, things have started to turn around for the sector despite a 2021 shortage in chip supply, which forced some to cut production.

Shares in Germany's BMW rose 2.3% after the group said it achieved record sales of over 2.2 million vehicles from its BMW brand in 2021, outstripping 2019 levels.

BofA expects European light vehicle production and sales to increase by 10% this year, with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Renault and Stellantis leading the pack with projected growth rates at around 20%.

""We argue there is still substantial catch-up potential left and we remain positive on light vehicle sales growth in FY22,"" said Horst Schneider, research analyst at BofA.

ROOM FOR GROWTH

Higher car prices in 2021 offset an increase in costs in the second half of the year, analysts said. Yet European car stocks are much cheaper than U.S. peers.

Europe's auto sector is trading at just seven times forward earnings. That compares to 16.8 times for the STOXX 600 benchmark and a whopping 42.4 times for the U.S. auto sector . U.S. carmaker Tesla's market capitalization alone is more than twice the size of the entire STOXX 600 index.

""Autos are very cheap, but profitability is strong given excellent price mix, even on lower volumes, and chip shortages should ease,"" said Emmanuel Cau, equity strategist at Barclays.

Shares in Renault climbed 4.4% as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm said it had struck deals to supply the French carmaker and Volvo Cars.

Stellantis shares rose 3.4% as the Milan-listed company partnered with Amazon.com to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards and deploy electric vans on the online retail giant's delivery network.

Daimler's shares also rose 3% despite reports the company informed owners of its luxury cars of a technical defect that could spark a fire.

Not everyone is bullish, JP Morgan cut its production growth forecast for European light vehicles to 4% and 6% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, citing consumers' hesitancy towards buying internal combustion engines, postponing purchases of electric vehicles and the chips shortage.

But with demand still outstripping supply amid ongoing shortages of raw materials, the auto and auto parts space is poised for growth, according to Barclays.

You'll be able to control certain functions remotely via Google Assistant. You might tell your phone to lock the doors or ask a smart speaker to start warming up your car as you're getting ready to leave home.

Two-factor authentication is needed for ""more sensitive commands,"" like unlocking the doors. You can also learn info related to your car through Google Assistant.

More features will be added later, such as the option to schedule charging. Volvo will roll out Google Home integration in the coming months. To use it, you'll need an Android-powered infotainment system that's connected to the Volvo Cars app and a Google Assistant-enabled device.

It's not the first time we've seen integration with connected home platforms in cars. GM and BMW owners can control smart home devices from vehicles with built-in Alexa, while Samsung and Google brought a SmartThings dashboard to some models with Android Auto. Still, Google Home is one of the more prominent connected home platforms around. If you have a smart speaker with Google Assistant enabled, these features might come in useful.

In addition, YouTube will be the first video streaming service on Volvo's infotainment system. You'll be able to download the app from the Play Store. The automaker offers unlimited data in certain markets, so you might be able to watch as many videos as you like without worrying about busting your data allowance.

For safety reasons, you'll only be able to watch YouTube videos on the screen when the car's stationary. That will ensure Volvo avoids the kind of controversy Tesla was embroiled in recently, when it emerged that games were playable on the infotainment system while a car was moving. The company said it would disable that option after the NHTSA said it was looking into the matter.

Other apps that Volvo owners will soon be able to download to their infotainment system include navigation apps Sygic and Flitsmeister; charging apps ChargePoint and Plugshare; and parking services SpotHero and ParkWhiz.

Earlier this week, Volvo announced it will use Qualcomm's car chipsets to power the infotainment systems in Polestar 3 and its upcoming electric EV.

We currently have a wide variety of laptops. The manufacturers have put the batteries to be able to offer devices according to the needs of the different types of groups of the population. And, is that, now there is a huge range in which users can move.

Yes indeed, a key determining factor when choosing a laptop is the price. Many users are not willing to pay exorbitant amounts for a computer that they will only use to browse, reply to emails, and write text documents. Although companies always try to sell power, sometimes it is not necessary.

Qualcomm ventured to take the step and launched processors for laptops, this great promise of having a chip with low power consumption; but with sufficient power for day-to-day use, it was bought by companies and users. What happened is that these teams did not have the deserved reception.

What was the problem? The price. Laptops with Qualcomm processors and manufactured by other companies were uncompetitively priced and that they were placed almost at the same level as laptops capable of performing tasks such as video rendering, programming and 3D projects.

And, is that, faced with the dilemma of choosing between some teams or others; users bet on conventionality. Qualcomm itself has made it clear that the blame for this has been the way in which manufacturers have understood their processors, integrating them into premium equipment and for sectors that are too specific.

The example of the opposite is what has happened with the Apple MacBook with its M1 processor. This chip came to turn the thin, light and battery-powered Cupertino computers into true multitasking machines. In addition, the existence of models such as MacBook Air made this processor more democratized.

Qualcomm has also made it clear that it does not control the prices of devices that go on the market with its processors. We will have to see how the market evolves and how companies fit these Qualcomm statements, In the future, Arm laptops may reduce their price or have a more appropriate one.","{'uri': 'bullfrag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bullfrag'}",[],https://cdn.computerhoy.com/sites/navi.axelspringer.es/public/styles/1200/public/media/image/2021/01/qualcomm-2205461.jpg?itok=RM9wrp0T,0.04313725490196085,,False,0,0.04313725490196085,379102380,4

As more vehicles go electric and automakers evolve into software developers, we can only expect to see more plays directed at turning cars into connected devices.

One exemplar of this phenomenon is Volvo Cars, which will launch a direct integration with the Google Home ecosystem in the coming months, both Volvo and Google announced on Wednesday. The integration should allow car owners to turn their car on and off, control the temperature and get car information like battery life by issuing voice commands to Google Assistant-enabled home and mobile devices. Once customers pair their Volvo car to their Google account, they also can talk directly to Google while in their car.

This feature will be available in the United States and in European markets, like Sweden, Norway, Germany, Italy, France and Spain, with others soon to follow, according to Google.

In addition, because newer Volvo car models have Google built-in, they will soon be able to serve as a platform on which to download YouTube, thus enabling video streaming in cars, according to the automaker. YouTube will be available via Qualcomm's Snapdragon digital cockpit infotainment system, which Volvo announced would be implemented into its upcoming electric SUV. The partnership with Google is part of a larger move by Volvo to facilitate more digital services and keep passengers entertained, particularly as it prepares to introduce Ride Pilot, its new ""unsupervised"" autonomous driving feature that is expected to fully self-drive Volvo's upcoming electric SUV on highways to start, allowing drivers to be completely hands-free for whatever other activities they'd rather be doing than holding onto a steering wheel.

""Allowing our customers to watch videos while charging or when waiting to pick up their children from school is part of our promise to make their lives better and more enjoyable,"" said Henrik Green, chief product officer at Volvo Cars, in a statement. ""With YouTube and other major streaming services coming soon, our customers can enjoy their charging break instead of seeing it as just a hassle -- making electric car ownership that bit easier.""

Google isn't stopping with Volvo. In December, the tech giant unveiled its digital car key, which enables users to lock, unlock and even start compatible BMW cars from 2020, 2021 and 2022 through select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones. On Wednesday, Google said users later this year will be able to utilize the ultra-wideband digital car key to both unlock their vehicle without taking their phone out of their pocket, as well as share the key with others. The feature will be available in multiple markets across Europe, Asia, North America and parts of Africa, as well as Russia, New Zealand and Australia.","{'uri': 'techcrunch.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechCrunch'}",[],https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?w=701,0.2078431372549019,eng-7385337,False,0.5882353186607361,0.2078431372549019,379102380,1

Xiaomi did not immediately respond to the query on the issue.

The government said based upon intelligence that Xiaomi India was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, an investigation was initiated by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) against the company and its contract manufacturers. During the investigation, searches were conducted by the DRI at the premises of Xiaomi India, which led to the recovery of 'incriminating documents' indicating that Xiaomi India was remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., under contractual obligation.

It further added that statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments.

""During the investigations, it further emerged that the 'royalty and licence fee' paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers,"" the statement said.

It added that the investigations conducted by the DRI further showed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in India by importing parts and components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India. The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

""Evidence gathered during the investigations by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufactures were including the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 and Customs valuation (determination of value of imported goods) Rules 2007,"" the Ministry said, adding that by not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading Customs Duty being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof.","{'uri': 'thehindu.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Hindu'}",[],https://www.thehindu.com/business/zg5xcy/article38137722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2021-11-21T233248Z538496683RC28EN9OKDLORTRMADP3XIAOMI-RESULTSJPG,0.05882352941176472,eng-7385274,False,0.9764705896377563,0.05882352941176472,379102260,2

Barra said GM's expanding portfolio of electric vehicles, including the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup and the BrightDrop commercial vehicle range, also features two new Chevrolet crossovers, a $30,000 Equinox EV and a slightly larger Blazer EV, both of which will be introduced in 2023.

GM's new Ultra Cruise hands-free driving system will also debut in 2023 on another new EV, the Cadillac Celestiq ultra-luxury sedan. Barra said Ultra Cruise will use Qualcomm's new Snapdragon Ride compute platform for advanced driver assistance.

At last year's CES, Cadillac raised a few eyebrows with two futuristic concepts, including a flying car. At this year's event, Barra unwrapped a third Cadillac concept, the InnerSpace, described as a self-driving, two-passenger luxury coupe.

Iron ore futures rose on Wednesday as restocking demand in China propelled spot prices of the steelmaking ingredient to the highest in more than a week, despite renewed steel production controls in Tangshan city.

The most-traded May iron ore on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange ended daytime trading 2.1 per cent higher at 694 yuan ($US108.94) a tonne, rising for a second consecutive session. It touched 696.50 yuan earlier in the day, its strongest since December 27.

The steelmaking ingredient's most-active February contract on the Singapore Exchange was up 1.4 per cent at $US124 a tonne, as of 0710 GMT.

Despite a positive start to 2022, the overall outlook for iron ore and steel demand in China remains downbeat.

""We expect more restrictive policy in property (sector) will depress steel demand, with quotas for emissions intensive industries, specifically steel,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note.

""We predict 2022 will be a watershed year, with seaborne iron ore supply growing but China iron ore demand contracting,"" they said.

Google and Samsung have announced a new integrated version of Wear OS, but the problem was that non-Samsung watches, including Fossils, weren't eligible for upgrades from mid-to-late 2022. An updated version of the limited edition Razer smartwatch and Skagen Falster.

Before asking, no, the Razer X Fossil Gen6 smartwatch doesn't come with RGB lighting. However, it comes with three Razer branded watch faces, including a Chroma face that can be customized to match other Razers Chroma products. It's not technically RGB, but it's a workaround because it allows you to enable breathing and wave lighting patterns. The other two are more subtle. One is an analog face with the Razer logo, and the other is a Razer-inspired font that spells out time. The 44mm watch has a matte black case and two interchangeable straps. Black and stunning neon green.

This is pretty much the same as a gamer smartwatch, unless you count the fact that you can only buy 1,337. Garmin launched the esports fitness watch in late 2020. This allows you to track esports activity and stream biometrics on Twitch, but don't expect it here. The Razer X Fossil smartwatch is basically the same as the Gen6. In short, it's a Wear OS watch with a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear4100 + chip. A 1.28-inch color touch screen, built-in GPS, and contactless payment are also available. Like other Fossils watches, it can be charged quickly. This means you can use 80% battery in 30 minutes.

Fossil blamed whether to re-release the watch when it became popular, saying nothing was 100% planned. However, we couldn't rule out collaboration with Razer in the future. As for why Razer wanted to collaborate on smartwatches, Fossil says it's tied to recent efforts to promote mental health and wellness in esports. (And who can forget that Razer once tried to launch its own line of unlucky fitness bands and less smart smartwatches?)

If the Razer watch is a gamer version of Gen6, the new Skagen Falster is Gen6 with Danish minimalism veneer. The main upgrade here is to add a 4100+ chip and 6 colorways. It's not completely empty. According to Fossil, the more powerful 4100+ chip means it's possible to pack more features while maintaining Falsters' 42mm case size. It's refreshing to see the watch stay small in a world where smartwatches are getting bigger and bigger.

Both watches have the same health features, with a new SpO2 sensor, sleep tracking, and Fossil's new wellness app. More than 4100 power efficiency improvements also mean that you can finally use your Fossil smartwatch to track your sleep, but you still need to recharge it daily. Both are water resistant to 3 ATMs, so they are safe enough for showers and rainy days, but they cannot withstand swimming perfectly. (Usually, the pool needs to be water resistant to 5 ATMs.)

I had to spend time with both the Razer watch and the new Skagen Falster. The 4100 chip makes a big difference in performance and battery life compared to the Gen5 watch with the 3100. By design, the Falster looks great on the wrist, but it's not much different from the Falster 3. My unit had a metal strap, which made it stylish but not ideal for workouts or sleeping. The 44mm case was a bit big on my wrist, but the razor watch is also a handsome smartwatch. The neon green strap was also too big for my taste and was a bit unnecessary considering that most of the pizza comes from the Razer watch face. That said, if you want your smartwatch to match your mechanical keyboard, this should solve the problem.

The main thing to note is that both watches are currently running the old Wear OS 2. The advantage is that both are powered by the 4100+ platform, so you'll be able to upgrade to Wear OS 3 later this year (Google is working on pushing updates). However, it's a tricky time for Samsung watches to already run the new Wear OS, and there are rumors that Google is working on the 2022 Pixel Watch, which has prevented Fossil from selling the first Gen6. I admit that.

The 1,337 Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch will sell for $ 329 and will be available on the Fossil and Razers websites later this month. Meanwhile, all versions of Skagen Falster Gen 6 will sell for $ 295 this month.

Correction, January 5, 2022, 11:20 am: The original Fossils press release stated that the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 will be available on the GameStops website. The company informed us after announcing that this was incorrect.

This smartphone will replace the one known as Xiaomi Mi 11 and will arrive with a new processor, more battery and a new look, among other novelties. The leaks, in fact, have already advanced many details of this possible alternative to the iPhone 13, and we have compiled them. This is everything we know about the next high-end smartphone from the Asian company.

One of the data that we know for sure is its physical appearance. Although Xiaomi has only revealed the front, which seems to arrive with hardly any frames and with a small camera located at the top of the screen, the leaker OnLeaks has shared more detailed images where the possible design of the terminal can be appreciated from all its angles. According to the photographs, the Xiaomi 12 will arrive with a slightly different photographic module than its predecessor. It seems to take up more space at the back, even though it has the same number of lenses.

The rear area, as usual, will be made of glass, while the front will maintain the double curvature on the screen, although in the Xiaomi promotional image that curved panel does not seem to be so pronounced. The side frames, which will be made of aluminum, do not reveal any fingerprint scanners. Therefore, it is very likely that this system is included under the screen. The smartphone, yes, It will have more compact dimensions compared to the Xiaomi Mi 11. The Mi 12 could arrive with 152.7 millimeters in height, 70.0 mm in width and 8.6 mm in thickness. Therefore, it seems to be an alternative to models like the iPhone 13 or the future Samsung Galaxy S22.

Going into the specifications, and according to the latest reports, the Xiaomi 12 would arrive with a 6.52-inch AMOELD display. It will maintain the QHD + resolution, like the model last year, as well as a refresh rate of 120 Hz. The RAM and storage configuration does not seem to change compared to the Mi 11. Xiaomi will maintain the base configuration of 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory, adding, yes, a new processor. The company confirmed recently that this will be the first device of the brand - and one of the first in the world - to include the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, Qualcomm's most powerful SoC to date.

The battery, on the other hand, would go from the 4,6000 mAh of the Xiaomi Mi 11 tos 5,000 mAh for this new model. Also including a fast charge of nothing more and nothing less than 100W. Of course, the Xiaomi 12 is also expected to include wireless charging, and probably with a reversible charging mode, a function that allows other devices with Qi technology to be supplied with battery by docking them on the back of the smartphone.

Regarding the photographic section, everything indicates that the terminal will arrive with a triple lens and a configuration very similar to the model announced last year. That is, the primary sensor will stand out for its high resolution, probably 108 megapixels. The second sensor would be a 13-megapixel wide-angle camera, while the third camera would be dedicated to macro photography with a 5-megapixel resolution sensor.

The company has confirmed than Xiaomi 12 will be announced on December 28 in China. Subsequently, the smartphone is scheduled to launch globally, but we will probably have to wait until next year. The rest of the models that usually complete the high-end catalog, such as the Xiaomi 12 Pro or Xiaomi 12 Ultra, could be announced later.

The price of the Xiaomi 12, for the moment, is unknown. However, taking into account the list of specifications, it is likely that the terminal will be marketed from 700 - 800 euros, just like the Xiaomi Mi 11 did.","{'uri': 'bullfrag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bullfrag'}",[],https://hipertextual.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xiaomi-12-01-scaled.jpg,0.1372549019607843,eng-7385274,False,0.6313725709915161,0.1372549019607843,379101420,1

By Joice Alves

LONDON (Reuters) -European automobile stocks rose more than 2% to a record high on Wednesday as investors turned increasingly bullish on the sector on growing expectations for stronger car sales in 2022.

Investors' interest in car stocks across the region has ignited over the past few months with Europe's auto and auto parts index up more than 8% this week alone, surpassing a previous record high in November.

The sector has gained 33% in a year, outperforming the pan-European index, which has gained 23% over the same period.

After carmakers had to deal with high inventories over the past two years caused by a pandemic-induced slowdown in sales, things have started to turn around for the sector despite a 2021 shortage in chip supply, which forced some to cut production.

Shares in Germany's BMW rose 2.3% after the group said it achieved record sales of over 2.2 million vehicles from its BMW brand in 2021, outstripping 2019 levels.

BofA expects European light vehicle production and sales to increase by 10% this year, with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Renault and Stellantis leading the pack with projected growth rates at around 20%.

""We argue there is still substantial catch-up potential left and we remain positive on light vehicle sales growth in FY22,"" said Horst Schneider, research analyst at BofA.

ROOM FOR GROWTH

Higher car prices in 2021 offset an increase in costs in the second half of the year, analysts said. Yet European car stocks are much cheaper than U.S. peers.

Europe's auto sector is trading at just seven times forward earnings. That compares to 16.8 times for the STOXX 600 benchmark and a whopping 42.4 times for the U.S. auto sector. U.S. carmaker Tesla's market capitalization alone is more than twice the size of the entire STOXX 600 index.

""Autos are very cheap, but profitability is strong given excellent price mix, even on lower volumes, and chip shortages should ease,"" said Emmanuel Cau, equity strategist at Barclays.

Shares in Renault climbed 4.4% as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm said it had struck deals to supply the French carmaker and Volvo Cars.

Stellantis shares rose 3.4% as the Milan-listed company partnered with Amazon.com to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards and deploy electric vans on the online retail giant's delivery network.

Daimler's shares also rose 3% despite reports the company informed owners of its luxury cars of a technical defect that could spark a fire.

Not everyone is bullish, JP Morgan cut its production growth forecast for European light vehicles to 4% and 6% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, citing consumers' hesitancy towards buying internal combustion engines, postponing purchases of electric vehicles and the chips shortage.

But with demand still outstripping supply amid ongoing shortages of raw materials, the auto and auto parts space is poised for growth, according to Barclays.","{'uri': 'oann.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'One America News Network'}",[],https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-05T161930Z_1_LYNXMPEI040ND_RTROPTP_0_AUTOSTOCKS-EUROPE_1.jpg,0.3960784313725489,,True,0,0.3960784313725489,379101240,1

The self-driving vehicle for personal use is being co-developed with GM's majority-owned Cruise, Barra said at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, in a remote keynote message focused on the twin themes of vehicle electrification and autonomy.

Barra said GM's expanding portfolio of electric vehicles, including the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup and the BrightDrop commercial vehicle range, also features two new Chevrolet crossovers, a $30,000 Equinox EV and a slightly larger Blazer EV, both of which will be introduced in 2023.

GM's new Ultra Cruise hands-free driving system will also debut in 2023 on another new EV, the Cadillac Celestiq ultra-luxury sedan. Barra said Ultra Cruise will use Qualcomm's new Snapdragon Ride compute platform for advanced driver assistance.

At last year's CES, Cadillac raised a few eyebrows with two futuristic concepts, including a flying car. At this year's event, Barra unwrapped a third Cadillac concept, the InnerSpace, described as a self-driving, two-passenger luxury coupe.

A fourth Cadillac concept, the OpenSpace, was teased in a brief video as a ""vision for the next decade and beyond."" It was described by a GM insider as a ""luxury hotel room on wheels.""

It maintains practically the same design formula as previous Falster generations, right down to the 1.28-inch AMOLED display. But there are some changes. In fact, the size of the watch is slightly thicker at 11.5mm. (In terms of width, it's 42mm, or the same as the Falster 3.) The charging ring has an improved seal too, to stop metal rings from coming out - something that would happen before.

Fossil Group said the Skagen Falster Gen 6 supports 20mm watch bands, and it comes with a mesh steel one. Other physical features include a rotating crown for a power/primary button and two additional buttons that can be set by the user.

Inside the watch, there is Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chipset, 8GB of storage, and 1GB of RAM. Other specs include 3ATM water resistance, support for NFC and Bluetooth 5.0 LE, a heart rate sensor, and a 310mAh battery that can rapid-charge up to 80 per cent in 30 minutes.

Finally, the Skagen Falster Gen 6 will be upgraded to Wear OS 3 later in 2022.

As for pricing, the Skagen Falster Gen 6 starts at $295.

The self-driving vehicle for personal use is being co-developed with GM's majority-owned Cruise, Barra said at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, in a remote keynote message focused on the twin themes of vehicle electrification and autonomy.

Barra said GM's expanding portfolio of electric vehicles, including the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup and the BrightDrop commercial vehicle range, also features two new Chevrolet crossovers, a $30,000 Equinox EV and a slightly larger Blazer EV, both of which will be introduced in 2023.

GM's new Ultra Cruise hands-free driving system will also debut in 2023 on another new EV, the Cadillac Celestiq ultra-luxury sedan. Barra said Ultra Cruise will use Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s new Snapdragon Ride compute platform for advanced driver assistance.

At last year's CES, Cadillac raised a few eyebrows with two futuristic concepts, including a flying car. At this year's event, Barra unwrapped a third Cadillac concept, the InnerSpace, described as a self-driving, two-passenger luxury coupe.

Meanwhile, as UPST stock has fallen, the macro picture for growth stocks has improved.

As time has gone on, I've also become even more bullish on this company's longer-term growth outlook. Consequently, I recommend that long-term investors buy shares of Upstart at current levels. Today, the stock trades around the $150 mark.

Here's what you should know about UPST stock moving forward.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Ever since my previous article on Upstart was published on Nov. 26, UPST stock has fallen about 28%. The forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio is now 77, according to Seeking Alpha. That's down from a P/E of 84. Given Upstart's status as a rapidly growing, likely disruptive tech company, this is not a very high P/E.

Meanwhile, there are signs that the macro environment is also improving. That's largely because the omicron variant of Covid-19 appears to be much milder than delta. Further, it seems like the government is starting to prioritize things like the economy over strict pandemic protocols now, too. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for instance, recently lowered the quarantine period for workers.

This decision suggests that the government is approaching Covid in a new way, even mirroring recommendations made by some scientists over a year ago. The strategy? To ""allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.""

In my view, this new approach can in turn help lower inflation, preventing the Federal Reserve from having to quickly raise interest rates. As a result, growth names like UPST stock will likely rebound in 2022.

In addition to the improving macro environment, a few factors have made me more upbeat on this company's longer-term outlook. First, the company -- which entered the auto-lending market in October -- should benefit from the easing of the chip shortage and other supply-chain issues in that sector. Recently, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon said the crisis is becoming less intense. That trend should continue in 2022.

Secondly, one Seeking Alpha article recently reported that Upstart should soon enter the mortgage market. According to Statista, the primary U.S. mortgage market was worth about $16.6 trillion in 2020. Obviously, if Upstart could generate even 0.25% or 0.5% of the revenue from that sector, both its financial results and UPST stock would soar tremendously.

Finally, though, Upstart has said it's also looking to enter the U.S. micro loan market for both consumers and small businesses. In the States, microcredit is an ""underserved"" area where banks often fear to tread. In fact, in a May 2021 blog, credit-rating bureau Experian wrote the following:

I believe that Upstart -- with its advanced AI-based technology -- will likely be much better at predicting defaults on micro loans than more widely used, older technologies. All told, it could generate a great deal of revenue and profit in that area.

No doubt, micro loans could be a great avenue for Upstart as the company expands. However as I noted above, that's not the only thing this company has going for it.

Given the recent sharp decline in UPST stock, along with the improving macro picture and the big potential of its new products, shares here are definitely a buy for growth investors. Consider buying this name while you can.

The self-driving vehicle for personal use is being co-developed with GM's majority-owned Cruise, Barra said at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, in a remote keynote message focused on the twin themes of vehicle electrification and autonomy.

Barra said GM's expanding portfolio of electric vehicles, including the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup and the BrightDrop commercial vehicle range, also features two new Chevrolet crossovers, a US$30,000 Equinox EV and a slightly larger Blazer EV, both of which will be introduced in 2023.

GM's new Ultra Cruise hands-free driving system will also debut in 2023 on another new EV, the Cadillac Celestiq ultra-luxury sedan. Barra said Ultra Cruise will use Qualcomm's new Snapdragon Ride compute platform for advanced driver assistance.

At last year's CES, Cadillac raised a few eyebrows with two futuristic concepts, including a flying car. At this year's event, Barra unwrapped a third Cadillac concept, the InnerSpace, described as a self-driving, two-passenger luxury coupe.

A fourth Cadillac concept, the OpenSpace, was teased in a brief video as a ""vision for the next decade and beyond.""

GM, a company transitioning from automaker to platform innovator, provided a view of EV technology's inflection point at CES one year ago.

""Technology driven by purpose will change the world,"" said Deborah Wahl, GM global chief marketing officer. ""GM is redefining how people and goods are moved. Our commitment to a vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion has positioned us to lead. As we implement our growth strategy, we have an opportunity and, frankly, an obligation to create a better future for generations to come. That's the Ultium Effect.""

GM's ""Ultium Effect"" message guides the company's virtual CES experience accessible at www.GMExhibitZero.com. The site showcases waves of change that began with GM's introduction of the Ultium EV Platform in early 2020. Ultium, which was recently recognized among Fast Company's ""Next Big Things in Tech 2021"" underpins vehicles including the GMC HUMMER EV Edition 1 Pickup and the BrightDrop EV600, which were delivered to initial customers late last year, as well as the Cadillac LYRIQ when deliveries begin later this year.

Headlining GM's CES 2022 is the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV. This reimagined full-size pickup was developed from the ground up and leverages the power of GM's Ultium Platform. At launch, the Silverado EV will be available in two configurations, an RST First Edition and a fleet-oriented WT model - both offer a revolutionary mix of performance, capability, technology and style. The Silverado EV will offer an expected GM-estimated 400-mile range on a full charge1 along with 10.2kW of offboard power, available four-wheel steering, fixed-glass roof, Multi-Flex Midgate with a load floor of up to 10 feet, 10 inches when combined with the Multi-Flex Tailgate, a large, 17-inch-diagonal LCD freeform infotainment screen, and the latest vehicle technologies that can evolve over time.

Additional news and topics showcased at CES include:

GM's plan to reach leadership in EV market share in the U.S. that, beyond the Chevrolet Silverado EV, will include a Chevrolet Equinox EV SUV with an estimated MSRP starting around $30,000* in the U.S. as well as a larger Chevrolet Blazer EV SUV. Both Equinox EV and Blazer EV will be available in 2023. These three products will place Chevrolet EVs in the industry's two largest segments and one of the fastest growing segments in the U.S. Photos and initial details of the Equinox EV are available here. GM is working to build an EV movement beyond its retail business through the BrightDrop ecosystem, the Chevrolet Silverado EV Work Truck, and even component sales for commercial and recreational vehicles. Customers planning to place fleet orders include FedEx and Walmart (BrightDrop EV600) as well as Enterprise and Quanta (Chevrolet Silverado EV). Supported by the Chevrolet brand's rapidly expanding EV portfolio, GM intends to lead in electric vehicles. With GM's EV portfolio today and just on the horizon - including BrightDrop electric vans, Chevrolet Silverado EV, Equinox EV, Blazer EV, Bolt EV and EUV, along with GMC Sierra EV, GMC HUMMER EVs and Cadillac LYRIQ and CELESTIQ - GM believes that no other automaker today matches the depth and range of GM's growing all-electric portfolio. GM and Cruise are pursuing a comprehensive path to autonomous mobility with the aim to deliver the first personal autonomous vehicle from General Motors as soon as mid-decade. GM and Cruise's continued work together will create economies of scale that lower costs and increase quality of Cruise's rideshare and delivery networks while bringing the positive impacts of autonomous vehicles to a larger audience. Super Cruise remains on track to be available on 22 models across GM brands by 2023, while Ultra Cruise, which will enable door-to-door hands free driving, enters production in 2023, with the Ultium-based Cadillac CELESTIQ ultra-luxury sedan being among the first models to be equipped with the technology. GM will be the first company to use Qualcomm Technologies' Snapdragon Ride™ Platform for advanced driver assistance technology, defined by software developed in-house by GM. Co-developed by GM and Qualcomm for Ultra Cruise, the new compute architecture will have the processing capability of several hundred personal computers, but is only about the size of two laptops placed on top of one another. The expansion of Cadillac's Halo Concept Portfolio with the InnerSpace and OpenSpace autonomous vehicles. These two new concepts build on the PersonalSpace vertical takeoff and landing vehicle and the SocialSpace personal autonomous vehicle introduced at CES last year, and together the four illustrate a potential future for multimodal luxury travel when GM's Ultium EV and Ultifi software platforms are fused with autonomous driving technology. New examples of possible customer experiences enabled by Ultifi, GM's end-to-end vehicle software platform that enables frequent and seamless delivery of software-defined features, services and ownership experiences. Theoretical vehicle modes include ""Max Power Mode,"" which recalibrates electric vehicles for quicker acceleration; ""Choose Your Own Adventure Mode,"" which creates a scavenger hunt to discover shops, restaurants or landmarks; and ""Planetarium Mode,"" which uses a vehicle's GPS to project nearby constellations onto vehicle screens.

""We are witnessing what's possible when innovators and problem solvers embrace the opportunity to change the world, knowing they have the tools and technology to do precisely that,"" stated Wahl. ""With that capability comes the responsibility to use it. GM's Ultium Platform means we no longer need to imagine a zero-emissions future; we can start building it.""

The continent-wide STOXX 600 index rose 0.1% to 494.35 points, its third consecutive record closing high.

But a recent rally appeared to be losing traction, amid concerns over the omicron coronavirus variant, rising interest rates and mixed economic data.

The European automobile subindex was the best performer, jumping 2.7% to a record high as investors expected production to roar back from a semiconductor shortage, with car sales also likely to improve.

Germany's BMW added 2.2% after it achieved record sales from its BMW brand in 2021.

But JPMorgan took a cautious stance for the sector in 2022, citing consumer uncertainty over electric vehicles in Europe.

""We... see a sharper recovery in 2H22 as additional chip capacity comes online,"" analysts at the investment bank wrote. The bank is also overweight on automakers such as Daimler and Renault, as well as tyremakers Michelin and Nokian.

Renault jumped 5.3% to the top of France's CAC 40 after Qualcomm announced deals to supply chips to automakers including the French carmaker.

Mining stocks rose 1.6%, tracking stronger commodity prices as investors bet that demand would recover from a COVID-induced lull.

Other economically-exposed sectors also gained, with banks up 0.2% on expectations of higher interest rates.

Technology stocks fell 0.5% as the prospect of higher rates made the sector appear less attractive.

""There are wobbles in the global equity markets on the back of higher back-end U.S. Treasury yields and concerns about the Chinese tech sector,"" Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, said.

""We should see the fear ebb to leave us with the shape of a reality that is less clear cut than post COVID-19 shock.""

Data also painted a mixed picture of the euro zone economy, as a survey showed a recovery faltered in December due to a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.

Among other movers, Nestle slipped 2.7%, and was among the top drags on the STOXX 600 after Jefferies downgraded the firm on expectations that its margins would remain under pressure from commodity cost inflation.

Valneva fell for the seventh consecutive day amid uncertainty over its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

By Joice Alves

LONDON (Reuters) -European automobile stocks rose more than 2% to a record high on Wednesday as investors turned increasingly bullish on the sector on growing expectations for stronger car sales in 2022.

Investors' interest in car stocks across the region has ignited over the past few months with Europe's auto and auto parts index up more than 8% this week alone, surpassing a previous record high in November.

The sector has gained 33% in a year, outperforming the pan-European index, which has gained 23% over the same period.

After carmakers had to deal with high inventories over the past two years caused by a pandemic-induced slowdown in sales, things have started to turn around for the sector despite a 2021 shortage in chip supply, which forced some to cut production.

Shares in Germany's BMW rose 2.3% after the group said it achieved record sales of over 2.2 million vehicles from its BMW brand in 2021, outstripping 2019 levels.

BofA expects European light vehicle production and sales to increase by 10% this year, with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Renault and Stellantis leading the pack with projected growth rates at around 20%.

""We argue there is still substantial catch-up potential left and we remain positive on light vehicle sales growth in FY22,"" said Horst Schneider, research analyst at BofA.

ROOM FOR GROWTH

Higher car prices in 2021 offset an increase in costs in the second half of the year, analysts said. Yet European car stocks are much cheaper than U.S. peers.

Europe's auto sector is trading at just seven times forward earnings. That compares to 16.8 times for the STOXX 600 benchmark and a whopping 42.4 times for the U.S. auto sector. U.S. carmaker Tesla's market capitalization alone is more than twice the size of the entire STOXX 600 index.

""Autos are very cheap, but profitability is strong given excellent price mix, even on lower volumes, and chip shortages should ease,"" said Emmanuel Cau, equity strategist at Barclays.

Shares in Renault climbed 4.4% as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm said it had struck deals to supply the French carmaker and Volvo Cars.

Stellantis shares rose 3.4% as the Milan-listed company partnered with Amazon.com to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards and deploy electric vans on the online retail giant's delivery network.

Daimler's shares also rose 3% despite reports the company informed owners of its luxury cars of a technical defect that could spark a fire.

Not everyone is bullish, JP Morgan cut its production growth forecast for European light vehicles to 4% and 6% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, citing consumers' hesitancy towards buying internal combustion engines, postponing purchases of electric vehicles and the chips shortage.

But with demand still outstripping supply amid ongoing shortages of raw materials, the auto and auto parts space is poised for growth, according to Barclays.","{'uri': 'shorenewsnetwork.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Shore News Network'}",[],https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportBusinessNews/tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXMPEI040ND-BASEIMAGE.jpg,0.3960784313725489,,True,0,0.3960784313725489,379100040,1

By Joice Alves

LONDON (Reuters) -European automobile stocks rose more than 2% to a record high on Wednesday as investors turned increasingly bullish on the sector on growing expectations for stronger car sales in 2022.

Investors' interest in car stocks across the region has ignited over the past few months with Europe's auto and auto parts index up more than 8% this week alone, surpassing a previous record high in November.

The sector has gained 33% in a year, outperforming the pan-European index, which has gained 23% over the same period.

After carmakers had to deal with high inventories over the past two years caused by a pandemic-induced slowdown in sales, things have started to turn around for the sector despite a 2021 shortage in chip supply, which forced some to cut production.

Shares in Germany's BMW rose 2.3% after the group said it achieved record sales of over 2.2 million vehicles from its BMW brand in 2021, outstripping 2019 levels.

BofA expects European light vehicle production and sales to increase by 10% this year, with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Renault (PA:RENA) and Stellantis leading the pack with projected growth rates at around 20%.

""We argue there is still substantial catch-up potential left and we remain positive on light vehicle sales growth in FY22,"" said Horst Schneider, research analyst at BofA.

ROOM FOR GROWTH

Higher car prices in 2021 offset an increase in costs in the second half of the year, analysts said. Yet European car stocks are much cheaper than U.S. peers.

Europe's auto sector is trading at just seven times forward earnings. That compares to 16.8 times for the STOXX 600 benchmark and a whopping 42.4 times for the U.S. auto sector. U.S. carmaker Tesla's market capitalization alone is more than twice the size of the entire STOXX 600 index.

""Autos are very cheap, but profitability is strong given excellent price mix, even on lower volumes, and chip shortages should ease,"" said Emmanuel Cau, equity strategist at Barclays (LON:BARC).

Shares in Renault climbed 4.4% as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) said it had struck deals to supply the French carmaker and Volvo Cars.

Stellantis shares rose 3.4% as the Milan-listed company partnered with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards and deploy electric vans on the online retail giant's delivery network.

Daimler's shares also rose 3% despite reports the company informed owners of its luxury cars of a technical defect that could spark a fire.

Not everyone is bullish, JP Morgan cut its production growth forecast for European light vehicles to 4% and 6% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, citing consumers' hesitancy towards buying internal combustion engines, postponing purchases of electric vehicles and the chips shortage.

But with demand still outstripping supply amid ongoing shortages of raw materials, the auto and auto parts space is poised for growth, according to Barclays.","{'uri': 'uk.investing.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Investing.com UK'}",[],https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPEI040ND_M.jpg,0.3960784313725489,,True,0,0.3960784313725489,379098720,1

The phones were revealed on January 4 in a keynote by the Chinese giant, and the flagship GT 2 Pro is amongst the handful of devices to debut Qualcomm's flagship processor. The vanilla GT 2 model gets the outgoing Snapdragon 888 SoC which is no slouch either. Both these models tout a custom-developed bio-based polymer back material replicating the feel of paper.

Realme has positioned the GT 2 Pro as a high-end device for demanding users, and the unique use of material gives it an advantage in the similar seeming phone arena. The challenge for Realme's design studio and industrial designer Naoto Fukasawa was to create a non-fossil-based material with the same structural integrity while saving 2 kg CO2/kg of body weight.

Coming onto the high-end specifications, Realme GT 2 Pro gets a flat Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protected 6.7-inch LTPO 2.0 AMOLED display (QHD+ resolution) featuring 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate and 1,000Hz touch sampling rate. The adaptive refresh rate promises battery life improvement of around 50 percent as compared to previous AMOLEDs with 30Hz - 120Hz variable refresh rate.

On top of this, the phone gets 10bit colors and HDR10+ certification from DisplayMate. This should bring an immersive viewing experience, smooth UI, and enhanced performance in gaming for the users.

Realme GT 2 Pro has a potent camera setup in the form of a 50MP Sony IMX766 main sensor (OIS and 1.0µm pixels), secondary Samsung JN1 50MP ultrawide lens (150 field of view), and a microscope lens capable of shooting 40x close-ups. The device is loaded with a 5,000mAh battery and 65W fast charging capability.

According to Relame, the flagship phone has a very slim look and feel to it with a thickness of just 8.18mm and a weight of 189 grams. The flagship processor on the GT 2 Pro is paired to the top end 12GB RAM and 512GB storage - so, nothing has been left for users to complain about.

Both the Pro model and the GT 2 variant will get the Paper White, Paper Green, Steel Black and Titanium Blue color options. The 8GB/128GB trim of GT 2 Pro is priced at CNY 3,899 (approx. $615) and the 12GB/512GB costs CNY 4,999 (roughly $790).","{'uri': 'androidcommunity.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Community'}",[],https://androidcommunity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Realme-GT-2-Pro.jpg?w=640,0.4352941176470588,eng-7382953,False,0.7137255072593689,0.4352941176470588,379098660,1

Mobile chip maker Qualcomm has lifted the lid on its plans to provide hardware and software for future Volvo, Honda and Renault models at CES 2022.

The US-based company, which also confirmed it would be developing chips for BMW's self-driving cars towards the end of 2021, took to the trade show floor in Las Vegas to discuss the suite of infotainment and assistance tools now available to the above automakers.

Those tools, dubbed collectively as the Qualcomm Digital Chassis, include Snapdragon Ride, Snapdragon Cockpit, Snapdragon Auto Connectivity and Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud Services.

Each covers a different technological area - be it driving assistance or multimedia - and the partnered car brands can choose to implement these features collectively or in isolation.

Volvo, for instance, will implement Qualcomm's Snapdragon Cockpit - software for powering multiple displays and immersive audio systems - in its upcoming fleet of electric cars, including those under the Polestar banner.

That means vehicles like the Polestar 3 SUV and the Swedish automaker's soon-to-be-released fully electric SUV will boast infotainment systems that are ""twice as fast"" as their predecessors, with their ability to generate graphics ""up to 10 times faster.""

Honda will likewise utilize Qualcomm's advanced infotainment technology in cars coming to the US in the second half of 2022, and globally in early 2023. Upcoming models will benefit from improved AI experiences and in-cabin capabilities like blind spot reduction aids, assisted braking notifications and signals for approaching emergency vehicles.

The Renault Group, meanwhile, will work with Qualcomm to leverage a more inclusive adoption of all the tools available as part of the Snapdragon Digital Chassis.

The implementation of Snapdragon Auto Connectivity, for example, will mean upcoming Renault models are likely to feature market-leading LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi and GPS systems (read: top-of-the-range sat navs).

We already knew Qualcomm and Google have joined hands to supply a key computing chip for the digital dashboard of the next-generation Renault Megane E-TECH, with the in-development Renault 5 EV likely to benefit from the partnership, too.

Perhaps the most interesting tool in the Qualcomm Digital Chassis, though, is the Snapdragon Ride system.

After Qualcomm's $4.5 billion purchase of automotive technology firm Veoneer last year, the Snapdragon Ride suite now includes a new chip for computer vision which, the company says, is capable of tapping into a car's set of cameras to vastly improve safety features like automatic lane control.

Models developed by automakers making use of this particular tool will also benefit from improved map crowd-sourcing, driver monitoring systems (DMS), parking systems and cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technologies.

There's every chance, then, that the first commercially-viable self-driving car could wear a Volvo, Honda, Renault or BMW badge.

A show-cause notice has been slapped on Xiaomi India following recovery of documents during searches on its premises that indicated remittance of royalty and licence fee to US and Chinese firms under contractual obligations, the union finance ministry said on Wednesday.

Replying to an email query, a Xiaomi spokesperson said, ""At Xiaomi India, we give utmost importance to ensuring we comply with all Indian laws. We are currently reviewing the notice in detail. As a responsible company, we will support the authorities with all necessary documentation.""

Evidence gathered during investigations by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufacturers were including the amount of royalty paid by the firm in the assessable value of the goods imported by the company and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of the customs law, the ministry said.

By not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" in the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading customs duty, being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof, it added.

""After completion of the investigation by the DRI, three show cause notices have been issued to M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited for demand and recovery of duty amounting to Rs. 653 crore for the period April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962,"" the finance ministry said.

During the investigations, it further emerged that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by the firm and its contract manufacturers.

Investigations further showed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by the company or assembled in India by importing components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India.

The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

The DRI officials had received intelligence input that M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited (Xiaomi India) was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, following which an investigation was initiated by DRI against the company and its contract manufacturers.

By Joice Alves

LONDON (Reuters) -European automobile stocks rose more than 2% to a record high on Wednesday as investors turned increasingly bullish on the sector on growing expectations for stronger car sales in 2022.

Investors' interest in car stocks across the region has ignited over the past few months with Europe's auto and auto parts index up more than 8% this week alone, surpassing a previous record high in November.

The sector has gained 33% in a year, outperforming the pan-European index, which has gained 23% over the same period.

After carmakers had to deal with high inventories over the past two years caused by a pandemic-induced slowdown in sales, things have started to turn around for the sector despite a 2021 shortage in chip supply, which forced some to cut production.

Shares in Germany's BMW rose 2.3% after the group said it achieved record sales of over 2.2 million vehicles from its BMW brand in 2021, outstripping 2019 levels.

BofA expects European light vehicle production and sales to increase by 10% this year, with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Renault (PA: RENA ) and Stellantis leading the pack with projected growth rates at around 20%.

""We argue there is still substantial catch-up potential left and we remain positive on light vehicle sales growth in FY22,"" said Horst Schneider, research analyst at BofA.

ROOM FOR GROWTH

Higher car prices in 2021 offset an increase in costs in the second half of the year, analysts said. Yet European car stocks are much cheaper than U.S. peers.

Europe's auto sector is trading at just seven times forward earnings. That compares to 16.8 times for the STOXX 600 benchmark and a whopping 42.4 times for the U.S. auto sector. U.S. carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA )'s market capitalization alone is more than twice the size of the entire STOXX 600 index.

""Autos are very cheap, but profitability is strong given excellent price mix, even on lower volumes, and chip shortages should ease,"" said Emmanuel Cau, equity strategist at Barclays (LON: BARC ).

Shares in Renault climbed 4.4% as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) said it had struck deals to supply the French carmaker and Volvo Cars.

Stellantis shares rose 3.4% as the Milan-listed company partnered with Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards and deploy electric vans on the online retail giant's delivery network.

Daimler's shares also rose 3% despite reports the company informed owners of its luxury cars of a technical defect that could spark a fire.

Not everyone is bullish, JP Morgan cut its production growth forecast for European light vehicles to 4% and 6% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, citing consumers' hesitancy towards buying internal combustion engines, postponing purchases of electric vehicles and the chips shortage.

But with demand still outstripping supply amid ongoing shortages of raw materials, the auto and auto parts space is poised for growth, according to Barclays.","{'uri': 'za.investing.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Investing.com South Africa'}",[],https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/e9d4223b2e7505857ddb3e03d957e856_w_800_h_450.jpg,0.3960784313725489,,True,0,0.3960784313725489,379098000,1

The biggest US chipmakers, including Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) and Qualcomm Inc, are starting off the year by unveiling products that push further into each other's main territories, signaling that they are girding for tough competition as semiconductor demand increases across industries.

Intel, clinging to its title of world's largest chipmaker by revenue, on Tuesday showed off graphics chips aimed at fighting Nvidia and AMD in their area of domination.

Nvidia's latest chips are targeted at persuading more laptop owners to choose its highly specialized graphics capabilities, and AMD touted products meant to maintain its market share gains.

Qualcomm, the biggest maker of chips used in mobile phones, bolstered its drive to win a chunk of the personal computer market, leveraging its dominance in smartphone technology.

The flurry of announcements at the annual CES gadget show, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, highlights the shifting competitive landscape for a group of companies whose technology rules the computer and mobile phone industries.

The show is based in Las Vegas, but is mostly taking place virtually.

In an online presentation earlier in the day, Intel announced its 12th-generation Core mobile processors, including 28 new models that are as much as 40 percent faster than their predecessors.

Crucially, new Arc graphics chips are being shipped to PC makers, including Acer Inc (宏碁), Dell Technologies Inc and HP Inc, which are to use them in upcoming machines aimed at gamers, it said.

The Arc chips are Intel's attempt to cut into the dominance of Nvidia and AMD in high-end graphics. More laptops are using add-in graphics cards to bolster capabilities in gaming and content creation, which are increasingly determining customer preferences.

Intel's chips in the past have only offered graphics built into main microprocessors, typically with less power to generate realistic images.

Nvidia countered by unveiling new graphics chips for laptops, aimed at bringing high-end gaming and artificial intelligence capabilities to the thinnest and lightest computers.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics processor would equip notebooks with prices starting at US$2,499, giving them better capabilities than many previous high-end desktop models, Nvidia said in a virtual presentation, adding that laptop models running on the 3070 Ti chip would start at US$1,499.

Nvidia, whose market value is larger than any other chipmaker, is rolling out new products as it works to broaden the reach of its technology into the laptop market. Most thin computers contain what is called integrated graphics, capabilities typically built into central processors from Intel or AMD.

AMD chief executive officer Lisa Su (蘇姿丰) showed off new laptop and graphics processors, meant to continue the company's run of stealing market share from Intel.

AMD's graphics chips have come closer in performance to Nvidia's, but the larger company still controls the majority of the market for add-in cards for PC gamers that can cost more than US$1,000.

In one of the few remaining in-person appearances at CES, Qualcomm president and chief executive officer Cristiano Amon spoke about his commitment to bringing smartphone technology-based processors to the PC market.

He listed customers such as Microsoft Corp, Acer and Lenovo Group Ltd (聯想).

Amon also talked up his push into automotive semiconductors, unveiling chips that would help vehicles pilot themselves.

That move would put him in more direct competition with Intel's Mobileye unit and Nvidia.","{'uri': 'taipeitimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}",[],https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2022/01/06/P11-220106-335.jpg,0.1372549019607843,eng-7383643,False,0.8313725590705872,0.1372549019607843,379097940,3

Microsoft and Qualcomm announced an expanded partnership centering on augmented reality (AR) at CES 2022. The companies will work together to expand AR within the consumer and enterprise sectors. The partnership includes the development of custom AR chips that will allow companies to make lightweight glasses for augmented reality.

The hardware that comes forth from this partnership will integrate with software such as Microsoft Mesh and the Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer platform.

Qualcomm's press release on the partnership doesn't share any specifics about upcoming hardware. It's likely safe to say that the collaboration between Microsoft and Qualcomm is good news for those hoping to see consumer-aimed AR devices.

Microsoft's HoloLens 2, which runs on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 850, is an enterprise-focused machine. It's used by NASA and several large organizations in a variety of ways. There's even a HoloLens 2 Industrial Edition that's used in cleanrooms and hazardous environments.

Qualcomm's statement shows that AR will continue to be a focus of enterprise development, but that augmented reality could also have a place for general consumers.

""This collaboration reflects the next step in both companies' shared commitment to XR and the metaverse,"" said Qualcomm's vice president and general manager of XR Hugo Swart. ""Qualcomm Technologies' core XR strategy has always been delivering the most cutting-edge technology, purpose-built XR chipsets and enabling the ecosystem with our software platforms and hardware reference designs. We are thrilled to work with Microsoft to help expand and scale the adoption of AR hardware and software across the entire industry.""

From information-rich cockpit experiences to promises of assisted and autonomous driving, much of the headline-generating news from the last few shows has centered on the automobile. In fact, many have argued that the car industry is morphing into the next big segment of the tech business.

Companies like the Intel's Mobileye, graphics giant Nvidia, and Qualcomm are all using CES 2022 to announce their newest offerings for the automotive industry, as well as important new partnerships with car makers and automotive suppliers.

In the case of Qualcomm, Snapdragon Ride Vision brings a new degree of simplicity and focus to automakers looking to offer safety-focused, computer-vision powered ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) capabilities to a broader range of cars, while the Snapdragon Digital Chassis taps into the demand for completeness and flexibility in advanced automotive computing solutions.

Digital Chassis provides a framework that can combine the company's Snapdragon Ride assisted and autonomous driving platform, Snapdragon Cockpit for multi-screen infotainment, Snapdragon Auto Connectivity for 5G and 4G LTE external connections as well as WiFi and Bluetooth internal connections, and Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud services to enable new functionality and business models for connected cars.

While Qualcomm introduced many of these offerings before, with Digital Chassis it's adding the software that allow the pieces to easily integrate and interoperate. For car companies looking to find a technology partner for a complete, connected, digital car experience, Digital Chassis looks to be an intriguing and potentially attractive option.

Modern cars are enormously complex beasts, and as many automakers and suppliers have learned over the last few years, adding multiple, advanced technology offerings into the mix is proving to be more challenging than many initially expected. So, any efforts to simplify the process by essentially ""pre-integrating"" various pieces (not only Qualcomm's, but its software partners' as well) can be considered a positive step forward. This is particularly true for newer car companies that take a modern, complete car system approach to design and manufacturing.

At the same time, as auto industry veterans and close industry watchers understand, the componentized way that many cars from traditional automakers are designed and built can make it difficult for this kind of complete solution to work -- despite its potential elegance from a pure technology perspective.

That's why Qualcomm is offering the flexibility of letting car makers mix and match different sub-elements of the Digital Chassis framework so that, for example, a car maker could use a Qualcomm solution ADAS, but a different vendor's solution for infotainment.

To that end, Qualcomm has also added more open interfaces to its various services as part of the Digital Chassis effort to enable more customization options. This also allows carmakers to, for example, use their own custom-developed driving stack software or leverage the software that Qualcomm provides.

In addition, with the broadening of its car-to-cloud services options -- not to mention its 20-year+ history of telematics and other connectivity solutions to car makers via its modem business -- Qualcomm hopes to create service-based business models. The idea is to allow carmakers to generate revenues after the car has been sold for things like feature upgrades, new content services, etc., that consumers would pay for, potentially providing a new revenue stream for all parties involved.

On the partner side, Qualcomm recently introduced a deal with BMW to power several of the Digital Chassis capabilities starting with the 2025 model year, and at CES, the company announced new efforts with Volvo, as well as expanded work with Honda, Renault, GM, Tier 1 supplier Alps and several Chinese carmakers.

Qualcomm also announced the debut of Snapdragon Ride Vision, expected to be in vehicle production by 2024. Powered by a new 4nm-based Snapdragon SoC and partner Arriver's computer vision software, Snapdragon Ride Vision is positioned in part as a competitor to Mobileye's offerings.

It can be paired with widely available cameras to create a simple, yet very functional, system to bring critical safety-related features to even entry level cars. It can also be scaled up to provide semi-autonomous Level 2 and 3 driving capabilities when paired with Qualcomm's existing Snapdragon Drive SoC and Drive Accelerators, along with additional sensing technologies like radar and lidar.

Solutions like Snapdragon Ride Vision are focused on key functional safety benefits that consumers really want -- such as automatic braking, object detection and avoidance, lane keeping and lane changing, automated highway driving, driver monitoring, etc.

One of the challenges that has plagued the auto industry's implementation of potentially game-changing fully autonomous driving technologies is that many early efforts that received a great deal of attention were essentially trying to boil the ocean. They grossly overpromised and underdelivered on what they could do, and that has led to both dramatically longer timelines and significantly revised expectations for autonomous cars.

Even if those early efforts did work, it turns out they were promising capabilities that a large majority of consumers didn't even want. Solutions like Snapdragon Ride Vision, on the other hand, are focused on key functional safety benefits that consumers really want -- such as automatic braking, object detection and avoidance, lane keeping and lane changing, automated highway driving, driver monitoring, etc. In addition, these can be scaled up to more practical and more technologically realistic levels of autonomous driving for those who want to explore them.

Snapdragon Ride Vision System offers open software interfaces via the Snapdragon Ride SDK and gives automakers, or their suppliers, the ability to customize to their unique needs and preferences. For automakers that want to be able to extend the value and uniqueness of their brand into a car's digital experience, this is crucial.

Taken together, the Snapdragon Digital Chassis and Ride Vision offerings highlight the continued evolution of Qualcomm's efforts for the automotive industry. Though many still think of the company as mobile device focused, it's clear that Qualcomm's vision of mobility is expanding to a much broader world.

By Joice Alves

LONDON (Reuters) -European automobile stocks rose more than 2% to a record high on Wednesday as investors turned increasingly bullish on the sector on growing expectations for stronger car sales in 2022.

Investors' interest in car stocks across the region has ignited over the past few months with Europe's auto and auto parts index up more than 8% this week alone, surpassing a previous record high in November.

The sector has gained 33% in a year, outperforming the pan-European index, which has gained 23% over the same period.

After carmakers had to deal with high inventories over the past two years caused by a pandemic-induced slowdown in sales, things have started to turn around for the sector despite a 2021 shortage in chip supply, which forced some to cut production.

Shares in Germany's BMW rose 2.3% after the group said it achieved record sales of over 2.2 million vehicles from its BMW brand in 2021, outstripping 2019 levels.

BofA expects European light vehicle production and sales to increase by 10% this year, with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Renault and Stellantis leading the pack with projected growth rates at around 20%.

""We argue there is still substantial catch-up potential left and we remain positive on light vehicle sales growth in FY22,"" said Horst Schneider, research analyst at BofA.

ROOM FOR GROWTH

Higher car prices in 2021 offset an increase in costs in the second half of the year, analysts said. Yet European car stocks are much cheaper than U.S. peers.

Europe's auto sector is trading at just seven times forward earnings. That compares to 16.8 times for the STOXX 600 benchmark and a whopping 42.4 times for the U.S. auto sector. U.S. carmaker Tesla's market capitalization alone is more than twice the size of the entire STOXX 600 index.

""Autos are very cheap, but profitability is strong given excellent price mix, even on lower volumes, and chip shortages should ease,"" said Emmanuel Cau, equity strategist at Barclays.

Shares in Renault climbed 4.4% as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm said it had struck deals to supply the French carmaker and Volvo Cars.

Stellantis shares rose 3.4% as the Milan-listed company partnered with Amazon.com to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards and deploy electric vans on the online retail giant's delivery network.

Daimler's shares also rose 3% despite reports the company informed owners of its luxury cars of a technical defect that could spark a fire.

Not everyone is bullish, JP Morgan cut its production growth forecast for European light vehicles to 4% and 6% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, citing consumers' hesitancy towards buying internal combustion engines, postponing purchases of electric vehicles and the chips shortage.

But with demand still outstripping supply amid ongoing shortages of raw materials, the auto and auto parts space is poised for growth, according to Barclays.","{'uri': 'news.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}",[],https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RgkhimQgrWG2ccvWw9kkPQ--~B/aD01MDk7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters-finance.com/df8c8079b87892d869ab6b7204a4c391,0.3960784313725489,,False,0,0.3960784313725489,379097400,1

By leveraging Volvo Cars' and technology firm Qualcomm's in-house research and development competence, the companies will improve the overall capability of Volvo's next-generation infotainment system powered by Google Android, making it much faster and more responsive.

Qualcomm's Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms is designed to be a central hub for high-performance computing. It is capable of fulfilling highly demanding graphics, audio and artificial intelligence requirements in the forthcoming Polestar 3 SUV and Volvo Cars' upcoming fully electric SUV, all while having a very low power consumption.

Using the latest Snapdragon Automotive Platforms, Volvo Cars' next generation infotainment system will be more than twice as fast, while its graphics generation will be up to ten times faster.

For Volvo Cars, the transition towards becoming a fully electric car company and a leader in the premium electric car segment by 2030 means more than simply offering pure electric cars - it also includes offering seamless connectivity, industry-leading safety standards, advanced autonomous drive and the best possible user experience. To support these ambitions, Volvo Cars is teaming up with global technology leaders where it makes sense.

""Volvo Cars is a company that believes in collaborating with technology leaders like Qualcomm Technologies Inc. and Google to deliver the best experience to our customers,"" said Henrik Green, Volvo Cars chief product officer. ""With Qualcomm technology in our forthcoming fully electric SUV, our Google Android-based infotainment system will reach the next level.""

Together with Qualcomm and Google, Volvo Cars can deliver an industry-leading video, audio and connectivity performance in its next generation of fully electric cars.

""We are proud of the strong organizational concentration in automotive that we have in Europe, which spans across engineering, services, product marketing and go-to-market.""

Simultaneously, the collaboration includes future improvements to be rolled out over the air and over time. It also creates a solid foundation that enables Volvo Cars to continue delivering premium, connected, intelligent and responsive in-car experiences in the future.

For the twelve months between July 2020 and June 2021, Volvo Car Group recorded an operating profit of 22.5 BSEK (14.3 BSEK in 2019). Revenue over the period amounted to 292.1 BSEK (274.1 BSEK), while global sales reached 773,000 cars.

Volvo Cars was founded in 1927. Today, it is one of the most well-known and respected car brands in the world with sales to customers in more than 100 countries. Volvo Cars is listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, where it is traded under the ticker ""VOLCAR B"".

Volvo Cars aims to provide customers with the Freedom to Move in a personal, sustainable and safe way. This is reflected in its ambition to become a fully electric car maker by 2030 and in its commitment to an ongoing reduction of its carbon footprint, with the ambition to be a climate-neutral company by 2040.

As of December 2020, Volvo Cars employed approximately 40,000 full-time employees. Volvo Cars' head office, product development, marketing and administration functions are mainly located in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Well, Fossil and Razer have got together to announce a special edition at CES 2022: the Razer X Fossil Gen 6 Smartwatch.

The special edition is the very same design as the Fossil Gen 6 - with its 44mm case, 22mm strap, and Qualcomm Wear 4100+ platform - but comes with some Razer special extras.

The primary feature that'll have gamers salivating is the addition of four customisable Razer Chroma RGB lighting effects, using the 1.28-inch AMOLED display's output, while three exclusive Razer watch faces will further help with the unique look.

There are also two custom-designed interchangeable straps, both in iconic Razer colours - black and (luminescent) green - to ensure the special edition looks every part the Razer accessory.

Interestingly, the Razer X Fossil Gen 6 Smartwatch will be limited to just 1,337 pieces total. Why such an unusual number? Razer geeks will already know: that's leetspeak for 'Elite', the same number that Razer has used for special edition devices in the past - such as the Razer Phone.

And how much will you pay for one of those 1,337 special edition releases? The US price is set at $329, so just a $30 premium over the standard watch.","{'uri': 'pocket-lint.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pocket-lint'}","[{'uri': 'mike_lowe@pocket-lint.com', 'name': 'Mike Lowe', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/1200x630/assets/images/159532-smartwatches-news-razer-x-fossil-gen-6-smartwatch-image1-qm8h7lisyr.jpg,0.2705882352941176,eng-7386037,False,0.6901960968971252,0.2705882352941176,379096680,1

The Fossil Gen 6 was released back in September, becoming the first watch with Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chipset (no, Mobvoi didn't beat them). Fossil Group has now announced two new watches based on the Gen 6 -- an updated Skagen Falster, and a new model developed in partnership with Razer.

The Skagen Falster has been one of the more fashionable Wear OS watches over the past few years, with minimal bezels and detached lugs that give it a more minimalist design than most other smartwatches. The Skagen Falster 3 was released last year, based on the Fossil Gen 5 smartwatch, and now Fossil Group is giving it an upgrade based on the Gen 6. For all intents and purposes, this is a Fossil Gen 6 with a different frame -- it has the same Wear 4100+ SoC, the same 8GB storage, the same sensors, and so on.

The Skagen Falster Gen 6 will be available in five styles, all using the same 42mm case size (the same as the smaller Fossil Gen 6). The style options mirror what was available with the older Falster 3, including my favorite variant, the leather band with the silver watch. You'll also be able to swap the bands for any standard 20mm watch band.

Meanwhile, Fossil has partnered with Razer (yes, the Razer that makes gaming PCs and accessories) to create the 'Razer x Fossil Gen 6' smartwatch. It's essentially the larger (44mm) Fossil Gen 6 with two custom bands in the box, a black strap and a green strap, and three exclusive watch faces. This will apparently be a very limited edition run, with only 1,337 units available for purchase.

The main catch is that both watches will be running Wear OS 2 at launch, not the newer Wear OS 3 that debuted on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic last year. Fossil says that the Falster Gen 6 and Razer x Fossil are compatible with Wear OS 3, and they will receive the update sometime in 2022.","{'uri': 'xda-developers.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'XDA-Developers'}","[{'uri': 'corbin_davenport@xda-developers.com', 'name': 'Corbin Davenport', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/12/SKG4369233_SP22_AD_11.jpg,0.0980392156862746,eng-7386037,False,0.8352941274642944,0.0980392156862746,379096620,1

On Arm PCs, Amon told the crowd that ""there was a lot of skepticism about the transition of the PC to Arm.""

""But it's happening,"" Amon said. ""It's inevitable.""

As for his company's investments in augmented reality -- including an expanded partnership with Microsoft around AR glasses -- and car technology with new partnerships with Volvo, Honda and Renault, Amon said the company's moves fit a strategy to reach a $700 billion market in the next decade in what he calls ""the connected intelligent edge.""

""It's an exciting time for Qualcomm,"" Amon said. ""And we are becoming the partner of choice at the edge for digital transformation.""

I had originally planned to attend the show in-person with my lovely mother, but just about every company I was set up to meet with or attend the press conference of pulled out of the show, instead switching to an all-digital format to deliver their information.

It's all thanks to the Omicron variant of COVID-19 which is responsible for sending case numbers to new heights that we've never seen before. As a safety precaution, many larger companies like T-Mobile, Google, Amazon, Intel, and Mercedes decided not to attend CES 2022 in-person and exclusively show off their latest innovations through the show's online portal.

While it's a bummer the show's Vegas presence shrunk so significantly, it moved forward regardless with many people still venturing out west to attend. After all, there are still over 2,000 exhibitors at the show this year.

So far, CES 2022 has felt more significant than it has in years past, with many announcements from all sorts of sectors of the tech industry like TVs, personal computing, smart home appliances, robotics, and more. I obviously can't cover everything I wanna talk about through blog posts (without going completely brain dead), so over the next couple of days, I'll be recapping some of the biggest and coolest announcements here on Wiretapped.

Samsung and LG have tons to talk about, while Hisense and TCL continue to flood the market

Samsung and LG always make a huge splash in the TV market at Ces, and this year was no different. Each company unveiled new lines of high-end televisions with many different sizes, form factors, and technologies. In particular, I was fascinated by Samsung's new Micro LED televisions which have now reached 110 inches in size with bezel-less designs and improved speakers. These TVs will obviously cost a ton of money, but boy do they seem pretty to look at.

Meanwhile, LG has a new slate of televisions led by the flagship OLED Evo TVs in the G2 and C2 series. Both lines offer 4K resolutions, incredible color reproduction and accuracy, improved brightness, HDMI 2.1, and 120Hz gaming. The G2 series now goes up to 97 inches in size, while the C2 offers a much more manageable 42-inch form factor for those with limited space but want an OLED TV.

The Verge's Chris Welch has a great piece rounding up Samsung's TV announcements, and I'm a big fan of Kate Kozuch's piece on Tom's Guide covering LG's announcements.

Sony also came through with a big TV announcement: the introduction of the first TV to use QD-OLED. It's essentially a sexier version of the OLED panels we've all come to know and love, and Sony's got it on both a 65-inch and 55-inch TV. I wrote up a piece yesterday detailing it.

Elsewhere, both Hisense and TCL introduced a slew of new TVs with improved picture quality, upgraded specs - the works, essentially. Joe Maring has great coverage of Hisense's offerings on ScreenRant, and C. Scott Brown's TCL article on Android Authority breaks down TCL's new mini-LED and QLED offerings as well as some accompanying soundbars from the company.

Mercedes-Benz teases a solar-powered EV, while Sony introduces a new Mobility sector

Everyone loves a good car concept at CES 2022, and Mercedes-Benz didn't disappoint. The company's Vision EQXX research vehicle bundles solar panels for up to 620 miles of range on a full charge, which is ridiculous. James Pero over at Input has a neat preview of the vehicle.

Meanwhile, Sony has decided to get serious about EVs by introducing a new Sony Mobility sector of its business. The company unveiled a concept car to go along with it called the Vision-S 02, a new version of the Vision-S 01 from CES 2020. Steven Ewing at CNET has more.

Perhaps the most down-to-earth vehicle of the show so far is BMW's 2023 iX M60 since it'll actually launch. There seems to be a lot to like about it with more power under the hood, better range, and a classy interior. Motor Trend's Justin Banner has all the details you could want (and more) on the SUV.

Something for every gamer

It's no secret that I'm about the least-qualified technology journalist to be reporting on gaming hardware - the only video games I'm good at are Wii Sports Bowling and New Super Mario Bros. on the Nintendo DS. But CES 2022 introduced a ton of new gaming hardware that even peaked my novice interest.

I was especially intrigued by Asus' new ROG Flow Z13, a device that can be described as a Surface Pro 8 or iPad Pro for gaming. It's a 13.4-inch tablet with a detachable keyboard, up to a 12th-generation Intel Core i9, Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti graphics, and gobs of I/O. Asus says you can connect the device to an external GPU for even faster performance, and you can configure it with up to a 4K IPS touchscreen if you value quality. D. Hardawar at Engadget went hands-on with it.

Sony took the wraps off its new PlayStation VR 2 headset which comes with upgraded specs and a new Sense Controller. It'll require a PS5 to work, obviously. Matthew Humphries at PCMaghas all the details PlayStation fans crave.

There are also tons of gaming laptops that made their debut at CES from companies like Razer, Alienware, Lenovo, Gigabyte, Acer, and MSI. Cameron Faulkner at The Verge has a great roundup of most of the new laptops that use the latest hardware from Intel, Nvidia, and AMD.

So. Much. Chip. News.

Speaking of which, all three of those companies announced new chips, GPUs, and other silicon for new PCs and hardware to take advantage of. Intel always makes a big splash when they announce new processors thanks to the sheer amount of news it always has, and like clockwork, I look to the guys at XDA-Developers to break it down in a nerdy but concise way. The company's 12th-generation processors seem very interesting, especially the new Core i9-12900HK which Intel says is substantially faster than Apple's M1 Pro and M1 Max chips in certain areas.

AMD also had a big day with the announcement of its new Ryzen 7000 and 6000 series chips. Dylan Martin at CRN has a terrific piece which breaks down their five biggest announcements from the show.

Nvidia's announcements consisted of some new entries in the budget GPU category, as well as the flagship GPU market with its highest-end consumer graphics card to date. Ian Sherr at CNETcovered all of the company's announcements in one place.

Qualcomm also had an interesting day at CES with its announcement of a collaboration with Microsoft to develop new chips for AR glasses that will power the metaverse. The two companies will work in both consumer and enterprise markets and deliver unique hardware in both. Mary Jo Foley at ZDNet has a breakdown of the announcement.

New clamshells, 2-in-1s, and more get a notable limelight at CES

While the Consumer Electronics Show is infamous for being the place where you see all the cool new TVs, it's also served as a laptop showcase since January is a popular time for companies to debut their latest and greatest.

By far, the most interesting laptop I've seen is the Dell XPS 13 Plus. It looks nothing like what Dell has produced in the past, yet familiar at the same time. It's a lot flatter and feels more boxy than past XPS laptops, and the invisible trackpad and capacitive Function keys add a certain futuristic aesthetic that's hard to dismiss. I wrote up an article covering it.

I was also given all of Lenovo's CES materials ahead of time and was impressed with the looks of the ThinkPad Z series. They're a lot classier and more consumer-oriented in terms of their design, and I'm a huge fan.

HP also had a few announcements up its sleeve in the laptop department with the introduction of its new Elite Dragonfly G3 and Chromebook. Both laptops sport 3:2 displays, haptic trackpads, 12th-generation Intel processors, lightweight designs, and enhanced charging. The Elite Dragonfly Chromebook can even be used as a tablet thanks to its 360-degree hinge. Chris Martin at Tech Advisor has more.

Another notable mention: TCL made headlines with its very first attempt at a Windows 11-powered laptop. It's a budget laptop at $349, and it doesn't seem all that interesting spec-wise, but it's nonetheless an important step for TCL to take if it wants to make it in the ever-so-crowded laptop market. Stephen Lambrechts at Tech Radar covered the device in more detail.

Samsung and Anker make headlines

For some reason, there seems to be some hype around a product that never gets a lot of attention: the projector. Both Samsung and Anker have new portable and pricey projectors, with both offering 1080p resolutions and support for up to 100-inch screens. CNET's coverage of the devices from Sarah Lord and David Carnoy is worth checking out if you've been in the market for a projector and haven't been able to find a good one you like.

I won't lie, I got carried away with picking out cool stuff to feature in this newsletter. There's just so much of it this year!

I'll be back on Friday with another recap of other gadgets I've been fascinated by from CES 2022. Also, be sure to stay tuned because my annual CES Awards will be going live that same morning.","{'uri': 'matridox.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Matridox'}",[],https://i0.wp.com/matridox.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MICRO-LED_4.jpg?fit=1200%2C799&ssl=1&w=640,0.2313725490196079,,False,0,0.2313725490196079,379096380,1
,6875338047,,eng,2022-01-05T16:33:00Z,2022-01-05T16:00:00Z,news,https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/01/razer-and-fossil-made-a-smartwatch-designed-for-gamers-whatever-that-means/,Razer and Fossil Made a Smartwatch 'Designed for Gamers' (Whatever That Means),"Every company wants to make a smartwatch, but Razer -- a company best known for gaming peripherals decked out in RGB lighting -- at least had the good sense this time to partner with an experienced watch maker.

The result is the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch, a wearable that both companies claim is ""designed for gamers."" Let me be clear: This is not a wholly new smartwatch. It is Fossil's existing Gen 6 watch with Razer-y cosmetic touches. Those include three Razer watch faces -- two subdued, one with a little extra Razer lighting -- and two watch bands in Razer's signature black and neon green.

I'm not sure a smartwatch specifically for gamers -- whatever that means -- was really the move here, though it sounds like it could have had potential if the watch had gone full Razer. Perhaps some RGB detailing around the watch case that synced with with the lights on your keyboard? Fuck it, why not. There is a nod to the rest of Razer's lineup with a Chroma watch face that can be customised with lighting patterns. But really this is just a Fossil watch with some Razer watch faces and the option to swap out the black silicone band for an eye-searing green. (To be fair, some people like the green.) You get a 1.28-inch colour touchscreen in a matte black case, and while it looks perfectly fine, it's overall more subdued than we've come to expect from Razer. Sure, maybe an over-the-top gamer watch wouldn't have stuck the landing but it would've been fun to see at least.

But look, I'm not the target market for this. At 44mm, the watch is gigantic on my wrist, and the Razer watch faces don't do much for me. Then there's the matter of Fossil's Gen 6 platform: While it runs on Qualcomm's latest 4100+ chip for wearables, it hasn't yet been upgraded to Google's new Wear OS 3 operating system (and won't be until mid-late 2022). But the only watch you can buy that runs on the latest version of Wear OS is Samsung's Galaxy Watch 4, and it comes with some trade-offs: You can't use it with an iPhone, it doesn't have Google Assistant, and its health features are a little weird.

Razer has a health initiative for gamers, and to that end, the Fossil Gen 6 does offer some health-tracking features -- even an SpO2 sensor for monitoring blood oxygen levels. Google's Wear OS 2 interface makes it a little tricky to track all your health data in one spot -- Apple and Samsung definitely have this part down -- but you do get at least some advanced metrics. You can't track esports workouts or anything, but maybe that's asking too much.

Fossil Gen 6 will improve if it can be upgraded to Wear OS 3 sometimes in the near future. It will soon offer Alexa integration in addition to Google Assistant, so you're not saddled with Bixby, and you can use it with an iPhone. The hardware is fine. I just don't think anyone should pay $US30 ($41) extra for a couple watch faces when a non-Razer edition of the Gen 6 costs $US299 ($411) and is, for me at least, actually better-looking.

But few people will actually be able to buy the Razer x Fossil collab anyway. Only 1,337 (get it?) watches will be available as part of the drop, which happens Jan. 10 on Razer and Fossil's websites.","{'uri': 'gizmodo.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gizmodo AU'}",[],https://imgix.gizmodo.com.au/content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/06/705d7a50c838e46e0317c17e28ed3744-scaled.jpg?ar=16%3A9&auto=format&fit=crop&q=65&w=1200,0.09019607843137245,eng-7386037,False,0.7843137383460999,0.09019607843137245,379096380,1

Fossil and Razer are hoping to launch this year's hottest tech collab with the limited-edition, $329 Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch. And when I say limited, I mean it -- a mere 1,337 devices will launch for order on January 10, 2021.

Revealed during CES 2022, the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch is a repackaged version of the Fossil Gen 6 with hardware details and watch faces designed with Razer's audience in mind. I definitely wouldn't call the collaboration a ""gaming smartwatch,"" but with subtle Razer logos and nods to the brand's iconic neon green hue there's no mistaking it for any other wearable from the Fossil group.

The smartwatch features a matte black, 44-millimeter case with a pair of special silicone straps in black and green. Buckles on both straps feature ""Razer"" in the brand's stylized logo.

Three distinct Razer watch faces come loaded on the Razer x Fossil Gen 6. The text face spells out the time in an italicized digital while, while the analog face features the Razer logo and places for complications. The most interesting watch face, though, is Chroma -- it features a spinning color dial with four different color settings that you could even curate to match your gaming keyboard light settings.

If you're a gamer or fan of Razer products in any way, the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 is kind of brilliant. It's self-aware, matching your peripherals but also reminding you when you should get up at stand.

How do you become one of the lucky 1,337 Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch owners? First, I'll note the quantity pays homage to mid-2000s internet slang I knew nothing about before putting together this story. And once the phrase ""leetspeak,"" came up in my research, Fossil lost me. Still, to secure the groovy, limited-edition gaming wearable, set a reminder for January 10.

In addition to Razer x Fossil Gen 6, the Fossil Group announced the Skagen Gen 6 smartwatch for $295. Skagen's version of the smartwatch promises minimalist Danish design, with a unisex assortment of four different case and strap options. The stainless steel mesh bands look particularly nice. And like the Razer collaboration, the 42mm Skagen Gen 6 smartwatch offers select watch faces curated for the brand.

As a reminder, the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 and Skagen Gen 6 smartwatches are mostly the Fossil Gen 6 that came out in August 2021. The Gen 6 brings SpO2 monitoring, on-wrist call support for both iOS and Android users and the modernized Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chipset, which promises better battery efficiency (or a full 24 hours of use) and future compatibility with Wear OS 3.

Wear OS 3 still isn't ready for Fossil's latest smartwatch line, though we've been promised the Gen 6 will undergo the official update before the end of this year. That said, the company recently rolled out Spotify offline support and could introduce more user-facing updates before the Wear OS 3 roll out.","{'uri': 'tomsguide.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': ""Tom's Guide""}","[{'uri': 'kate_kozuch@tomsguide.com', 'name': 'Kate Kozuch', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZma7Jcs7UoUykroH6wncX-1200-80.jpg,0.1529411764705881,eng-7386037,False,0.8823529481887817,0.1529411764705881,379096320,1

LONDON (Reuters) -European automobile stocks rose more than 2% to a record high on Wednesday as investors turned increasingly bullish on the sector on growing expectations for stronger car sales in 2022.

Investors' interest in car stocks across the region has ignited over the past few months with Europe's auto and auto parts index up more than 8% this week alone, surpassing a previous record high in November.

The sector has gained 33% in a year, outperforming the pan-European index, which has gained 23% over the same period.

After carmakers had to deal with high inventories over the past two years caused by a pandemic-induced slowdown in sales, things have started to turn around for the sector despite a 2021 shortage in chip supply, which forced some to cut production.

Shares in Germany's BMW rose 2.3% after the group said it achieved record sales of over 2.2 million vehicles from its BMW brand in 2021, outstripping 2019 levels.

BofA expects European light vehicle production and sales to increase by 10% this year, with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Renault and Stellantis leading the pack with projected growth rates at around 20%.

""We argue there is still substantial catch-up potential left and we remain positive on light vehicle sales growth in FY22,"" said Horst Schneider, research analyst at BofA.

Higher car prices in 2021 offset an increase in costs in the second half of the year, analysts said. Yet European car stocks are much cheaper than U.S. peers.

Europe's auto sector is trading at just seven times forward earnings. That compares to 16.8 times for the STOXX 600 benchmark and a whopping 42.4 times for the U.S. auto sector. U.S. carmaker Tesla's market capitalization alone is more than twice the size of the entire STOXX 600 index.

""Autos are very cheap, but profitability is strong given excellent price mix, even on lower volumes, and chip shortages should ease,"" said Emmanuel Cau, equity strategist at Barclays.

Shares in Renault climbed 4.4% as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm said it had struck deals to supply the French carmaker and Volvo Cars.

Stellantis shares rose 3.4% as the Milan-listed company partnered with Amazon.com to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards and deploy electric vans on the online retail giant's delivery network.

Daimler's shares also rose 3% despite reports the company informed owners of its luxury cars of a technical defect that could spark a fire.

Not everyone is bullish, JP Morgan cut its production growth forecast for European light vehicles to 4% and 6% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, citing consumers' hesitancy towards buying internal combustion engines, postponing purchases of electric vehicles and the chips shortage.

But with demand still outstripping supply amid ongoing shortages of raw materials, the auto and auto parts space is poised for growth, according to Barclays.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'joice_alves@reuters.com', 'name': 'Joice Alves', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20220105&t=2&i=1586804935&r=LYNXMPEI040ND&w=800,0.3098039215686275,,True,0,0.3098039215686275,379096320,1

Google has had its eyes focused on cars for a while now, continuing development on phone-based solutions like Assistant Driving Mode and the in-dash version of Android Auto. Meanwhile, it's also continued to build Android Automotive, an entire operating system designed to integrate with every aspect of your vehicle. It's been a slow expansion, but with new partnerships between Qualcomm and various car companies, some major advancements are coming to the car company's next-gen electric vehicles.

As announced at CES 2022, the Polestar 3 SUV and Volvo's own upcoming electric SUV will be powered by Snapdragon's Cockpit platform. As described by Qualcomm, its vehicle-focused CPU enhances in-car experiences, ranging from navigation and audio to all instrument clusters and cameras. These systems all run on Android Auto -- just as the Polestar 2 did -- offering apps like Google Maps and Spotify to help improve your drive.

It's not the only partnership Qualcomm is touting at CES. Upcoming unspecified Honda vehicles planned for a late 2022 launch will utilize the 3rd-gen Cockpit platform. Likewise, although the company's press release doesn't call Android Automotive out by name, it does mention an ""Android-powered infotainment system."" Likewise, Renault Group will use Qualcomm's entire suite of Snapdragon-branded tools in its upcoming cars after previously launching its first Automotive-powered vehicle last fall.

Snapdragon Cockpit is part of the company's ""Digital Chassis"" platform, including driving assistance technology and, of course, in-car LTE and 5G connectivity. With pre-existing agreements with companies like GM and BMW already in place, Qualcomm's influence in the automotive marketplace is only set to grow throughout the next couple of years.

If you know anything about the Fossil Gen 6 that came out this fall, you should be familiar with the spec template. Both the Skagen Falster Gen 6 (above) and the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 (below) run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chipset which should bring improved multi-processor performance, better sleep tracking from previous generations, and (relatively) new heart rate and blood oxygen monitors. Other spec highlights for their Bluetooth 5.0 watches include a circular 1.28"" display with pixel density of 328 ppi (~420p), submersion rating of 3 ATM, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, and the ability to get an 80% charge with 30 minutes of fast charging. The general version of Wear OS 3, much unlike what we saw with Samsung's Galaxy Watch4, won't be available out of the box and there's no firm timetable on when the update will come (Google previously hinted at a ""mid to second half"" launch from Fossil). At least the Razer buyers will get three unique watchfaces to play with.

A show-cause notice has been slapped on Xiaomi India following recovery of documents during searches on its premises that indicated remittance of royalty and licence fee to US and Chinese firms under contractual obligations, the union finance ministry said Wednesday.

Xiaomi did not immediately offer any comment.

Evidence gathered during investigations by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufacturers were including the amount of royalty paid by the firm in the assessable value of the goods imported by the company and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of the customs law.

By not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" in the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading customs duty, being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof, the ministry said.

""After completion of the investigation by the DRI, three show cause notices have been issued to M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited for demand and recovery of duty amounting to Rs. 653 crore for the period April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962,"" the finance ministry said.

During the investigations, it further emerged that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by the firm and its contract manufacturers.

Investigations further showed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by the company or assembled in India by importing components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India.

The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

The DRI officials had received intelligence input that M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited (Xiaomi India) was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, following which an investigation was initiated by DRI against the company and its contract manufacturers.

During the investigation, searches were conducted by DRI at the premises of Xiaomi India, and the issue of remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd came to light.

Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments, it said.","{'uri': 'orissapost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Odisha News, Odisha Latest news, Odisha Daily - OrissaPOST'}",[],https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/xiaomi-drone-release-2016.jpg,0.07450980392156858,,True,0,0.07450980392156858,379096080,2

AnTuTu is one of the synthetic tests or benchmarks with which the power of the phones is quantified to somehow establish a performance scale that helps the user determine which phones are the most powerful on the market.

As expected, the leading positions in that AnTuTu ranking are the most desired by manufacturers, since they are the ones that users will appreciate as the most powerful mobiles. Normally, Xiaomi is a regular at the top of the ranking of the most powerful mobiles due to its AnTuTu score.

Based on the results that our analyzes usually obtain, we will see which Xiaomi mobiles are the most powerful and how they have worked in our hands.

Most powerful Xiaomi phones

The first place on this list is occupied by the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro, a high-end mobile phone manufactured by Xiaomi, which by power is not afraid to measure itself with the best of the high-end, but for the price, it does not drop its rings for deal with many premium mid-range phones and its price is around 899 euros.

This first place is given by first-class equipment in which Xiaomi has taken muscle against its direct rivals, demonstrating that it is capable of manufacturing the most powerful mobiles on the market, for half the price of its competitors.

In this model, Xiaomi has mounted a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor with 12 GB of RAM and 512 GB of internal storage, which gives it the necessary power to become the enemy to beat currently in the AnTuTu benchmark with 593,769 points.

The Snapdragon Ride SDK also comes with a comprehensive set of sample applications that allows developers to use in their own applications. While most of the sample applications use the optimized SDK libraries that are tuned to our hardware, in most cases, developers should be able to find sample applications that fits their needs and start with it as a baseline while developing custom applications. Some of the sample applications include:

sample application to run various complied neural networks on the platform and profile for KPIs like latency and utilization; a single camera pipeline application to run sample lane or object detection networks that allows developers to use both AIS camera and the AI SDK toolkit and visualize outputs; a multi-camera pipeline application that allows developers to work with multiple cameras and apply multiple networks in parallel; a lidar pipeline sample with point cloud visualization output; multiple sample applications that allow developers to test out various camera, lidar, and radar sensors that are supported by the platform; sample applications that showcase post processing using Fast ADAS libraries.

Developers can leverage the SDK sample applications by replacing the sample neural network definitions (that are part of the sample applications) with their own custom neural network definitions and add custom post-processing logic to develop their own applications.

Snapdragon Ride SDK allows developers to truly focus on creating applications without worrying about optimizing or rewriting fundamental components found in common ADAS algorithms.

Snapdragon Ride hardware and SDK is currently available to customers for evaluating, prototyping, developing and finally productizing their next-generation ADAS platforms. Contact your local Qualcomm Technologies sales team for further information.

Investors' interest in car stocks across the region has ignited over the past few months with Europe's auto and auto parts index up more than 8% this week alone, surpassing a previous record high in November.

The sector has gained 33% in a year, outperforming the pan-European index, which has gained 23% over the same period.

Graphic: Auto sector versus STOXX-

After carmakers had to deal with high inventories over the past two years caused by a pandemic-induced slowdown in sales, things have started to turn around for the sector despite a 2021 shortage in chip supply, which forced some to cut production.

Shares in Germany's BMW rose 2.3% after the group said it achieved record sales of over 2.2 million vehicles from its BMW brand in 2021, outstripping 2019 levels.

BofA expects European light vehicle production and sales to increase by 10% this year, with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Renault and Stellantis leading the pack with projected growth rates at around 20%.

""We argue there is still substantial catch-up potential left and we remain positive on light vehicle sales growth in FY22,"" said Horst Schneider, research analyst at BofA.

ROOM FOR GROWTH

Higher car prices in 2021 offset an increase in costs in the second half of the year, analysts said. Yet European car stocks are still much cheap compared to U.S. peers.

Europe's auto sector is trading at just seven times forward earnings. That compares to 16.8 times for the STOXX 600 benchmark and a whopping 42.4 times for the U.S. auto sector. U.S. carmaker Tesla's market capitalization alone is more than twice the size of the entire STOXX 600 index.

""Autos are very cheap, but profitability is strong given excellent price mix, even on lower volumes, and chip shortages should ease,"" said Emmanuel Cau, equity strategist at Barclays.

Shares in Renault climbed 4.4% as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm said it had struck deals to supply the French carmaker and Volvo Cars.

Stellantis shares rose 3.4% as the Milan-listed company partnered with Amazon.com to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards and deploy electric vans on the online retail giant's delivery network.

Daimler's shares also rose 3% despite reports the company informed owners of its luxury cars of a technical defect that could spark a fire.

Not everyone is bullish, JP Morgan cut its production growth forecast for European light vehicles to 4% and 6% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, citing consumers' hesitancy towards buying internal combustion engines, postponing purchases of electric vehicles and the chips shortage.

But with demand still outstripping supply amid ongoing shortages of raw materials, the auto and auto parts space is poised for growth, according to Barclays.

Qualcomm demonstrated a solid commitment to the automotive sector at this year's CES, announcing new OEM clients and establishing a software engineering center in Berlin to help the company's European auto customers with the unique Snapdragon Digital Chassis.

According to Enrico Salvatori, senior vice president and president of Europe/MEA and Qualcomm Europe, the office launch demonstrates the company's commitment to bringing innovative and exciting technologies to the automotive sector.

The digital chassis is a collection of cloud-connected platforms for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving. It includes the Snapdragon Ride Platform for ADAS and automated driving, the Auto Connectivity Platform for LTE, 5G connected services, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and precise positioning, and the next generation of the Snapdragon Cockpit, a digital cockpit, and infotainment system.

According to Qualcomm, the company's integrated automotive platforms, including the digital chassis, have a combined order pipeline of more than $13 billion. In its current form, Snapdragon is based on Qualcomm's car-to-cloud service, which was unveiled at CES 2020 and was the company's first product geared at keeping cars connected to the cloud. This would enable speedier over-the-air upgrades and vehicle and usage information collection, allowing the firm and its carmaker partners to generate new revenue streams.

Qualcomm Technologies' senior vice president and general manager of automotive, Nakul Duggal, stated that Qualcomm Technologies understands automakers' need for differentiation and uniqueness and the enormous opportunity to redefine the automotive and station, business models. The Snapdragon Digital Chassis enables platforms to remain continuously updated with new capabilities following vehicle purchase while allowing the automakers to develop new features and services and provides user interaction and service-based business models.

Volvo is one of a growing number of automakers to integrate Snapdragon technology into their vehicles on Tuesday, the firms announced. Volvo's upcoming fully electric SUV and Volvo EV brand's Polestar 3 SUV will both be powered by Qualcomm's digital cockpit, which runs on Google's Android operating system, and a suite of wireless technologies that support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and the automaker expects to launch the vehicles later this year.

Honda also announced plans to include Qualcomm's digital cockpit into its following models, which the company anticipates will be commercially available in the United States in the second half of 2022 and globally in 2023. In September, Renault Group announced plans to integrate the digital cockpit into its Mégane E-Tech electric vehicle. Still, on Tuesday, the company announced plans to expand the collaboration to the entire suite of digital chassis platforms, including the connectivity platform and the Snapdragon Ride platform.

Volvo, Honda, and Renault join an ever-growing list of Qualcomm Snapdragon customers, which appeared to have accelerated following Qualcomm's acquisition of automotive technology startup Veoneer in October. Qualcomm has since struck agreements with approximately 40 OEMs, including BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, JiDu, Xpeng, NIO, and WM, to integrate various Snapdragon platforms into their vehicles.

Qualcomm's Snapdragon platform also enables innovation by other firms developing automobile infotainment centers. At CES, the business announced cooperation with Alps Alpine to produce a Snapdragon-powered ""Digital Cabin."" The interior is equipped with innovations such as an e-mirror that helps alleviate blind spots by providing peripheral vision, a big ceiling display, and sound zones that direct noise to each passenger individually.

While most of Qualcomm's customers are upgrading their cockpits and infotainment systems, the company may be most bullish on its Ride platform, a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that should provide a robust enough CPU to support ADAS and autonomous driving features. Veoneer's Arriver self-driving software unit has upgraded Ride to the point where it can compete directly with Nvidia's Drive Orin SoC, which is already being utilized to provide similar functionality with customers such as Cruise Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Zoox, and, most recently, TuSimple.","{'uri': 'appedus.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Mobile App Development | Design | Marketing Magazine: Appedus'}",[],https://appedus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qualcomm-1.jpg,0.3098039215686275,eng-7383748,False,0.8156862854957581,0.3098039215686275,379095420,9

First up is a partnership with gaming accessory maker Razer. The two companies will release the Razer X Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch with three exclusive Razer watch faces ('Analog,' 'Text' and 'Chroma') and two interchangeable straps. The Razer X Fossil watch will launch globally but in a limited quantity of just 1,337 units.

The Razer X Fossil smartwatch will be available starting January 10th, 2022, on Razer's website, Fossil's website and at select retail stores for $329 USD (about $417.91 CAD). MobileSyrup has reached out to Fossil for more details about Canadian availability and pricing.

The second partnership is with Danish-inspired watch and jewelry brand Skagen. It will see the launch of the 'Falster' Gen 6 smartwatch, available in six styles with a 42mm case size. The Flaster watch will have silver-tone, rose-gold tone, charcoal and black case colours, as well as straps made with Skagen's iconic stainless steel mesh, silicone and leather.

Each Falster Gen 6 smartwatch style will retail for $295 USD (about $374.72 CAD) and be available for purchase on Skagen's website starting January 5th. MobileSyrup has reached out to Fossil for more details about Canadian availability and pricing.

While both of these special editions of the Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch look great, it's worth noting that aside from the unique straps and watch faces, these smartwatches essentially provide the same core experience as Fossil's new Gen 6 smartwatch. That means the watches still run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100+ platform, sport fast-charging up to 80 percent in 30 minutes, have heart rate and SpO2 sensors, and more.

It also means the watches will be compatible with Google's upcoming Wear OS 3 update slated to arrive sometime in 2022. However, some of the information Google has shared so far suggests upgrading to Wear OS 3 could be a rough process.

Still, if you like Wear OS and Fossil's smartwatches but want something unique, both the Razer and Skagen models look like excellent options.","{'uri': 'mobilesyrup.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MobileSyrup'}",[],https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/razer-and-skagen-fossil-gen-6-watch-header-scaled.jpg,0.01960784313725483,eng-7386037,False,0.8549019694328308,0.01960784313725483,379095420,1

Fossil knows its design language isn't for everyone, which is why the company is finally introducing its latest smartwatch under the Skagen brand. The new Skagen Falster Gen 6 is basically a Fossil Gen 6 with a minimal design that we know and love.

On the inside, you'll find there's nothing that differentiates the new Skagen Falster Gen 6 with the latest Fossil or Michael Kors watches. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chipset, which should make Wear OS 2 much more manageable.

The watch comes with Razer-themed green and black straps along with three themed watch faces included in the software. The chroma watchface will allow you to set up a colorful theme similar to the lighting on a Razer keyboard.

The two other Razer themed watchfaces include Text, which spells out the time, and an Analogue theme.

Apart from the bands and the watch faces, the Fossil Gen 6 ships with Google's Wear OS 2, with plans to upgrade to Wear OS 3 sometime in mid- to late 2022. The Gen 6 line debuted last summer, with a particular focus on being able to charge its battery from zero to 80% in 30 minutes and its faster Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 Plus chip. The watch also includes GPS, a heart rate sensor, Sp02 blood oxygen sensor and Bluetooth 5.0 LE connectivity.

The Gen 6 watch will also eventually get support for Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, which Fossil said will be coming in the near future. Alexa will be preloaded onto the watch, and will activate when Amazon adds that version of the assistant to Google's app store.

The watch will go on sale Monday with a 44mm black case, starting at $329. The limited edition will only be 1,337 units, because why not. It costs a bit more than the standard Gen 6's starting price of $299 (£279, AU$499).

A Fossil rep told CNET that the Razer collaboration is partially a test to see how the gaming audience would approach the smartwatch, whether it's a new customer, an existing customer or someone who would be into the limited edition element of this smartwatch.

Fossil is also unveiling its Gen 6 collaboration with Skagen Wednesday, which will be known as the Falster Gen 6 Smartwatch in a 42mm case size. The metal bezel on the Falster is slimmer than the Razer, but the display and everything else about the watch is identical to the other Gen 6 models.

The Skagen watches will come in several colors, including cases in silver, rose gold, charcoal and black. Strap options will be available in stainless steel mesh, silicone and leather.

Most will likely be fawning over the new line of Razer Blade laptops that just dropped at CES 2022 but for those who truly want to live that Razer lifestyle, the company already offers up a whole range of branded wares: from gaming chairs to apparel; there's even a collapsible Razer-branded drinking straw.

As such, a smartwatch makes a lot of sense and in many ways, it's a surprise that one hasn't launched sooner. 2016's Razer Nabu Watch is the closest thing to a smartwatch Razer has put out to date; a Casio G-Shock lookalike with some 'smart' abilities, including activity tracking and mobile notification support.

This latest Razer x Fossil Gen 6 collaboration is a little different. As the name suggests, the hardware is being supplied by Fossil; using its fresh-faced Gen 6 platform, which launched toward the end of 2021.

It relies on Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chipset, sports a 1.28in circular AMOLED display set within a 44mm stainless steel casing and runs Wear OS 2 out the box (with the promise of an upgrade to Wear OS 3, later this year).

In its official release, Razer speaks to the watch's fitness and wellbeing features: ""The Razer X Fossil Gen 6 Smartwatch also boasts top wellness features, confirming the commitment of both brands to well-being, and comes only a few months after the launch of Razer's dedicated wellness initiative for gamers, Champions Start From Within."" But as is often the case with consumer tech collaborations, the company's involvement is primarily cosmetic in this instance.

The watch comes complete with a pair of 22mm Razer logo-embossed interchangeable silicone straps (one in black and one in Razer's signature bright green), along with a trio of pre-loaded watch faces, dubbed 'Analogue', 'Text' and 'Chroma'.

It would have been nice to include a Razer Chroma tile or widget - letting gamers control their Chroma-compatible lighting effects from their wrist - but that looks to have been a step too far.

Where the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 aims to stand out is with its exclusivity. Despite international availability kicking off from 10 January, the company is only releasing 1,337 units, meaning if you manage to snap one up, you'll be part of an elite group.

The smartwatch will be available from both Fossil's and Razer's online stores, as well as ""select retail stores,"" priced at £319/€339/US$329/AU$549, meaning it comes with a slight premium, compared to the standard Fossil Gen 6 series.

Skagen Falster Gen 6 launched

Along with the Razer collaboration, ""Danish-inspired"" Fossil Group brand Skagen also pulled the wraps off its updated Wear OS watch line, with the Skagen Falster Gen 6 joining the Fossil Gen 6 and Michael Kors Gen 6 that were introduced last October.

While the design should be familiar to those who've worn a Falster before, this year's model comes with all the Gen 6 trimmings found on counterparts from its sister brands, including that all-important Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chip, fast charging (80% charge in 30 minutes) and SpO2 tracking; set within a 42mm casing that supports 20mm straps.

The Falster Gen 6 arrives a little sooner than the Razer watch, directly after its unveiling on 5 January, priced from £279/€299/US$295 and available from Skagen's own online store.

This year, in addition to launching new laptops, it's also teamed up with smartwatch maker Fossil to launch a special edition wearable. The two companies are announcing the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch at CES 2022 and it's basically what you think: A themed version of an existing Wear OS device with straps and faces that reflect the gaming company's identity.

But the Razer edition of the Gen 6 has some small differences. It only comes in the 44mm size (while the original is also available in 42mm) and also features some unique interface elements. I've had a sample to play with for awhile, and frankly, this feels like most Fossil smartwatches, just with an aesthetic nod to Razer.

The Fossil Gen 6 was the first to feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chip, and like the original series, the Razer edition will be updated to the new Wear OS 3 later this year. So far, the existing software on the watch felt familiar and performed quickly. I swiped through cards and changed watch faces with no delay, though that's par for the course for Wear OS watches these days. The three custom watch faces for the Razer-branded wearable were what I expected -- that is, they had matching color schemes and displayed the time in ""fun"" fonts. The Wellness face shows your daily stats, but doesn't look very Razer-esque.

There's not much else different about the device, and most other elements like battery life and system performance require me spending much more time with it to test.

What I can say now is that as a person with smaller wrists, the Razer watch is a bit too big for me. Are most Razer fans people more big-boned, or do they prefer a chunky aesthetic? I don't know, but it sure seems like that assumption is being made.

One thing I do believe Razer's loyalists love is the company's distinct acid green color that permeates their products. The special edition Gen 6 comes in a black finish with a black 22mm band with no pops of green on the case itself. But it does come with a bright green strap that you can swap out. Both silicone bands were pliable and comfortable, though, again, I'd prefer a narrower style.

The larger size does allow for a roomier screen (though the 42mm Gen 6 has the same display dimensions), and I enjoyed how easy it was to read app titles and notifications.

Razer and Fossil are only selling 1,337 units of this special edition device, because Leet, get it? Anyway, you can get one for $329. For comparison, the Fossil Gen 6 costs between $299 and $319. With its higher price and limited quantity, the Razer watch is clearly meant to be a collectible for the most loyal of the company's fans.

If you don't manage to get one of the Razer watches or are intrigued by Fossil's other brands, you could also consider the new Skagen Gen 6. The Skagen Falster is my favorite of Fossil's smartwatches, and the company is launching an updated version that offers its latest suite of features like the Snapdragon Wear 4100 processor, faster battery charging and upgraded sensors. It'll be available in six styles and cost $295.

Fossil also told Engadget that the Gen 6 series will be getting Alexa support early this year, so those who use Amazon's assistant for smart home device control can do that from their wrists.

The Razer x Fossil watch represents an intriguing expansion of Fossil's lineup, though we might see the company team up with other brands in future. Fossil told me it's open to the idea, so who knows? Maybe one day we'll see collabs with the likes of Tesla, McDonalds or, oh God, White Castle.","{'uri': 'finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

Intel, clinging to its title of world's largest chipmaker by revenue, showed off graphics chips aimed at fighting Nvidia and AMD in their area of domination. Nvidia's latest chips are targeted at persuading more laptop owners to choose its highly specialized graphics capabilities, and AMD touted products meant to maintain its market share gains.

Qualcomm, the biggest maker of mobile-phone chips, bolstered its push to win a chunk of the personal-computer market, leveraging its strength in smartphone technology.

The flurry of announcements at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) technology conference, based in Las Vegas but mostly taking place virtually, highlights the shifting competitive landscape for the group of companies whose technology rules the computer and mobile-phone industries. Intel's loss of leadership in chip-manufacturing technology has exposed it to challenges from newly confident rivals in the PC market. The company's response under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is to defend that market and, at the same time, to chase sales in its rivals' strongest businesses.

That fight will likely play out beyond 2022, with most analysts predicting Intel will struggle to boost sales this year, compared with revenue gains forecast for the other companies.

Still, on Tuesday, investors rewarded Intel's aggressive competitive posture. While chip stocks in general lost ground, Intel shares rose as much as 1.4%. Nvidia and AMD, which were among the best-performing stocks of 2021, each fell more than 5%. Qualcomm slid as much as 2.8%.

In an online presentation earlier in the day, Intel announced its 12 generation Core mobile processors, including 28 new models that are as much as 40% faster than their predecessors. Crucially, it also said new Arc graphics chips are being shipped to PC makers, including Acer, Inc., Dell Technologies, Inc. and HP, Inc., which will use them in upcoming machines aimed at gamers.

The Arc chips are Intel's attempt to cut into the dominance of Nvidia and AMD in high-end graphics. More laptops are using add-in graphics cards to bolster capabilities in gaming and content creation, which are increasingly determining customer preferences. Intel's chips in the past have only offered graphics built into main microprocessors, typically with less power to generate realistic images.

Nvidia countered by unveiling new graphics chips for laptops, aimed at bringing high-end gaming and artificial intelligence capabilities to the thinnest and lightest computers.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics processor will equip notebooks that will be priced starting at $2,499, giving them better capabilities than many previous high-end desktop models, Nvidia said on Tuesday in a virtual presentation. Laptop models running on the 3070 Ti chip will start at $1,499.

Nvidia, whose market value is larger than any other chipmaker, is rolling out new products as it works to broaden the reach of its technology into the laptop market. Most thin computers contain what's called integrated graphics, capabilities typically built into central processors from Intel or AMD.

Also as part of CES, AMD CEO Lisa Su showed off new laptop and graphics processors, meant to continue the company's run of stealing market share from Intel. AMD's graphics chips have come closer in performance to Nvidia's, but the larger company still controls the majority of the market for add-in cards for personal computer (PC) gamers that can cost more than $1,000.

And in one of the few remaining in-person appearances at CES, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke about his commitment to bringing smartphone technology-based processors to the PC market. He listed customers such as Microsoft Corp., Acer and Lenovo.

Qualcomm's chief also talked up his push into automotive semiconductors, unveiling chips that will help cars pilot themselves. That move will put him in more direct competition with Intel's Mobileye unit and Nvidia, which is also working to make chips to be the brains of vehicles of the future. -- Bloomberg","{'uri': 'bworldonline.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'BusinessWorld'}",[],https://www.bworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/technology-default.jpg,0.223529411764706,,True,0,0.223529411764706,379095000,3

We've been seeing a lot of products from smart TVs to phones to tablets. Just this week at the CES 2022 in Las Vegas, TCL announced new phones, new tablets, and new laptops. Every one in the family can choose from the slew of new devices that may be ideal to use for school, work, or business.

We'll focus on the new mobile devices starting with the TCL NXTPAPER 10s. The tablet offers eye protection but the paper-like display and blue light reduction. The screen is TÜV certified which means blue light is reduced by over 50%. There's also the anti-glare finish.

The 8000mAh battery is enough to last all day. That means a full day of reading, learning, creativity, and entertainment. It comes with a proprietary T Pen when you need to write down notes or highlight ideas. Price tag reads $249. It will be available first in China. Europe will get it later this January.

The next set of tablets include the TCL TAB 8 4G and TAB 10L. These are budget tablets that are ideal for everyone needing entertainment on-the-go. It comes with a 4080mAh battery, LTE, and WiFi. The TCL TAB 10L is bigger with a 10.1-inch HD touch display. Between the two, the bigger tablet is cheaper at only $99. The other device is $129 in Europe.

There are three more TCL TKEE tablets available: the TCL TKEE MINI, TCL TKEE MID (with 4G) and TCL TKEE MAX. All three come with an intuitive UI design for the children to learn and play safely. All three tablets are child-safe and childproof. They also come with an eye-safe screen technology.

These tablets work with the TKEE Pen for the children to use. It lets them work on their drawing and writing skills. Pricing begins at $89, $149, and $119, respectively.

There are two new smartphones available: the TCL 30 XE 5G and the TCL 30 V 5G. The latter can be purchased only from Verizon. It's an exclusive offering with a 6.7-inch Full HD+, TCL's NXTVISION technology, 4500mAh battery, 128GB onboard storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon octa-core processor.

When it comes to imaging, there is the triple rear camera headlined by a 50MP shooter with super wide-angle lens. There is a 16MP selfie camera with macro lens.

Every company wants to make a smartwatch, but Razer -- a company best known for gaming peripherals decked out in RGB lighting -- at least had the good sense this time to partner with an experienced watch maker.

The result is the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch, a wearable that both companies claim is ""designed for gamers."" Let me be clear: This is not a wholly new smartwatch. It is Fossil's existing Gen 6 watch with Razer-y cosmetic touches. Those include three Razer watch faces -- two subdued, one with a little extra Razer lighting -- and two watch bands in Razer's signature black and neon green.

I'm not sure a smartwatch specifically for gamers -- whatever that means -- was really the move here, though it sounds like it could have had potential if the watch had gone full Razer. Perhaps some RGB detailing around the watch case that synced with with the lights on your keyboard? Fuck it, why not. There is a nod to the rest of Razer's lineup with a Chroma watch face that can be customized with lighting patterns. But really this is just a Fossil watch with some Razer watch faces and the option to swap out the black silicone band for an eye-searing green. (To be fair, some people like the green.) You get a 1.28-inch color touchscreen in a matte black case, and while it looks perfectly fine, it's overall more subdued than we've come to expect from Razer. Sure, maybe an over-the-top gamer watch wouldn't have stuck the landing but it would've been fun to see at least.

But look, I'm not the target market for this. At 44mm, the watch is gigantic on my wrist, and the Razer watch faces don't do much for me. Then there's the matter of Fossil's Gen 6 platform: While it runs on Qualcomm's latest 4100+ chip for wearables, it hasn't yet been upgraded to Google's new Wear OS 3 operating system (and won't be until mid-late 2022). But the only watch you can buy that runs on the latest version of Wear OS is Samsung's Galaxy Watch 4, and it comes with some trade-offs: You can't use it with an iPhone, it doesn't have Google Assistant, and its health features are a little weird.

Razer has a health initiative for gamers, and to that end, the Fossil Gen 6 does offer some health-tracking features -- even an SpO2 sensor for monitoring blood oxygen levels. Google's Wear OS 2 interface makes it a little tricky to track all your health data in one spot -- Apple and Samsung definitely have this part down -- but you do get at least some advanced metrics. You can't track esports workouts or anything, but maybe that's asking too much.

Fossil Gen 6 will improve if it can be upgraded to Wear OS 3 sometimes in the near future. It will soon offer Alexa integration in addition to Google Assistant, so you're not saddled with Bixby, and you can use it with an iPhone. The hardware is fine. I just don't think anyone should pay $30 extra for a couple watch faces when a non-Razer edition of the Gen 6 costs $299 and is, for me at least, actually better-looking.

But few people will actually be able to buy the Razer x Fossil collab anyway. Only 1,337 (get it?) watches will be available as part of the drop, which happens Jan. 10 on Razer and Fossil's websites.","{'uri': 'gizmodo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gizmodo'}",[],"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/705d7a50c838e46e0317c17e28ed3744.jpg",0.09019607843137245,,True,0.800000011920929,0.09019607843137245,379095000,1

Style has always been a strength on Wear OS, with more choices for design and often classic watchmakers at the helm. This week, Fossil Group is introducing the Skagen Falster Gen 6, which brings next-gen capable specs to one of our favorite hardware designs.

Skagen Falster Gen 6 has a design that's virtually identical to the previous Falster generations, just with some improvements across the board. The size of the watch is the same width as the Falster 3 at 42mm, but it's slightly thicker at 11.5mm.

On the outside, the biggest change is the charging ring, which is now better sealed inside of the design to prevent the metal rings from coming out as was a common issue on Gen 5 products from Fossil Group. The Falster Gen 6 also supports 20mm watch bands, a slight step back from the 22mm straps that Falster 3 had adopted, with a mesh steel band being the default. The same 1.28-inch AMOLED display is in use, too.

Under the hood, Skagen Falster Gen 6 is running Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chipset, 8GB of storage, and 1GB of RAM. It further has 3ATM water resistance, a rotating crown for a power/primary button, and two additional buttons that can be defined by the user. NFC, Bluetooth 5.0 LE, and a heart rate sensor round out the spec sheet.

The only thing that, unfortunately, isn't being addressed just yet is the battery situation. Skagen Falster Gen 6 has rapid charging that promises up to 80% in just 30 minutes, but the battery size isn't changed from the previous 310 mAh. Wear OS 2 is also on board, meaning the software won't help out the battery situation at all. Luckily, though, Skagen Falster Gen 6 will be eligible for Wear OS 3 later this year.

Pricing for the Skagen Falster Gen 6 lands at $295, depending on which band/finish is selected. The smartwatch is available today from Skagen.com and other online retailers, such as Amazon.

Ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas yesterday (Dec. 4), the Japanese giant announced plans to set up a new unit called Sony Mobility by spring 2022.

The company also unveiled the Vision-S 02 SUV -- a new version of its first prototype EV, which was first shown at CES 2020. Over the last two years, the car, which initially seemed like an ad for Sony's range of technology, has gone way beyond a gimmick. It has been testing on European roads since the end of 2020.

""With our imaging and sensing, cloud, 5G and entertainment technologies combined with our content mastery, we believe Sony is well positioned as a creative entertainment company to redefine mobility,"" CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said at the event. The car has 33 safety sensors, sophisticated in-car entertainment with high-quality speakers, and impressive gaming capabilities.

Whether Sony plans to make electric cars independently, or partner with established carmakers, is still unclear.

Sony is hardly the first non-carmaker to experiment with vehicles. Back in 1994, timepiece company Swatch's founder Nicolas Hayek birthed the idea for the quirky Smart Car, which Mercedes built. However, ever since electric vehicles have entered the fray and made the industry a battleground for software supremacy, tech companies have gotten serious about making cars.

Apple has been working on autonomous cars for seven years, poaching and losing key talent along the way. Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi has plans to create own-brand EVs, and has hired a team of 300 to make it happen. There are rumors that another Chinese phonemaker, Oppo, is also entering the EV market.

Other companies are getting in on the action by making tech for carmakers. Qualcomm capitalized on ""growing opportunities"" in cars by partnering with Honda, Renault, and Volvo. NVidia's software engineers are working with Volkswagen, Audi, Toyota, Hyundai, Volvo, and Mercedes. Samsung is jointly producing electric car batteries with Stellantis. Huawei, whose phone business has been hit hard by US sanctions, is lending a technological hand to Chinese state-owned car company Changan. The world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn, showed off three prototype EVs to lure clients.

The transition to EVs is natural for consumer electronics companies that already work on autonomous functions, batteries, safety controls, media and entertainment, gaming, and other tech elements that go into building electric cars. And the sector holds great promise for them: The electric car market will only grow courtesy of improving consumer sentiment and government policies favoring decarbonization, including financial incentives and city-access restrictions. At least 20 countries have committed to fading out internal combustion engine vehicles completely in the next 10 to 30 years.","{'uri': 'qz.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Quartz'}","[{'uri': 'ananya_bhattacharya@qz.com', 'name': 'Ananya Bhattacharya', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sonyvisions02-e1641397189489.webp?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,0.2156862745098038,eng-7384366,False,0.5411764979362488,0.2156862745098038,379094880,1

This year, in addition to launching new laptops, it's also teamed up with smartwatch maker Fossil to launch a special edition wearable. The two companies are announcing the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch at CES 2022 and it's basically what you think: A themed version of an existing Wear OS device with straps and faces that reflect the gaming company's identity.

But the Razer edition of the Gen 6 has some small differences. It only comes in the 44mm size (while the original is also available in 42mm) and also features some unique interface elements. I've had a sample to play with for awhile, and frankly, this feels like most Fossil smartwatches, just with an aesthetic nod to Razer.

The Fossil Gen 6 was the first to feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chip, and like the original series, the Razer edition will be updated to the new Wear OS 3 later this year. So far, the existing software on the watch felt familiar and performed quickly. I swiped through cards and changed watch faces with no delay, though that's par for the course for Wear OS watches these days. The three custom watch faces for the Razer-branded wearable were what I expected -- that is, they had matching color schemes and displayed the time in ""fun"" fonts. The Wellness face shows your daily stats, but doesn't look very Razer-esque.

There's not much else different about the device, and most other elements like battery life and system performance require me spending much more time with it to test.

What I can say now is that as a person with smaller wrists, the Razer watch is a bit too big for me. Are most Razer fans people more big-boned, or do they prefer a chunky aesthetic? I don't know, but it sure seems like that assumption is being made.

One thing I do believe Razer's loyalists love is the company's distinct acid green color that permeates their products. The special edition Gen 6 comes in a black finish with a black 22mm band with no pops of green on the case itself. But it does come with a bright green strap that you can swap out. Both silicone bands were pliable and comfortable, though, again, I'd prefer a narrower style.

The larger size does allow for a roomier screen (though the 42mm Gen 6 has the same display dimensions), and I enjoyed how easy it was to read app titles and notifications.

Razer and Fossil are only selling 1,337 units of this special edition device, because Leet, get it? Anyway, you can get one for $329. For comparison, the Fossil Gen 6 costs between $299 and $319. With its higher price and limited quantity, the Razer watch is clearly meant to be a collectible for the most loyal of the company's fans.

If you don't manage to get one of the Razer watches or are intrigued by Fossil's other brands, you could also consider the new Skagen Gen 6. The Skagen Falster is my favorite of Fossil's smartwatches, and the company is launching an updated version that offers its latest suite of features like the Snapdragon Wear 4100 processor, faster battery charging and upgraded sensors. It'll be available in six styles and cost $295.

Fossil also told Engadget that the Gen 6 series will be getting Alexa support early this year, so those who use Amazon's assistant for smart home device control can do that from their wrists.

The Razer x Fossil watch represents an intriguing expansion of Fossil's lineup, though we might see the company team up with other brands in future. Fossil told me it's open to the idea, so who knows? Maybe one day we'll see collabs with the likes of Tesla, McDonalds or, oh God, White Castle.","{'uri': 'engadget.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'engadget'}",[],https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/36390f20-6db5-11ec-bfff-0ea23ded7989,0.192156862745098,,True,0.8549019694328308,0.192156862745098,379094820,1

Does the new Razer X Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch have RGB lighting? Well, it's not going to challenge one of the gaming brand's keyboards or PC components, but one of the three custom watch faces does add an RGB effect to the outer edge of the dial. That's good enough for us, and the geekiness level of this brand new limited edition smartwatch is raised even further by there only being 1,337 -- another way of writing ""leet,"" or elite when referring to a gamer's skill level -- made.

In addition to the three custom watch faces, you also get two special straps with the smartwatch, one in Razer's trademark green color scheme, and the other in black. It's based on Fossil's recently announced Gen 6 smartwatch platform and the design hasn't changed, but Razer's branding has been added to the buckle on each strap, and it comes in a cool, special edition box.

That's about it for the Razer-specific elements, and otherwise the specification is the same as the regular Gen 6. It has a 44mm case made from stainless steel which houses a 1.28-inch touchscreen. The case has stainless steel buttons, which aid in the operation of Google's Wear OS software. No, it's not the new Wear OS 3 platform seen on the Galaxy Watch 4, but the good news is Fossil confirms it will get Wear OS 3 in 2022.

While the software isn't bang up to date right now, the processor is. The Razer X Fossil Gen 6 has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 4100 chip inside, complete with 1GB of RAM and 8GB storage space. That should at least keep Wear OS running smoothly. The smartwatch has NFC for wireless payments, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, and a combination heart rate and Sp02 blood oxygen sensor on the back. Finally, the battery has fast charging and reaches 80% capacity in 30 minutes.

The Razer X Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch was announced at CES 2022 and will cost $329 when it's released in January. It will be sold through Razer and Fossil's website, plus through Gamestop as well. The low number of models being made means it may not hang around for long, so Razer fanatics should be quick to grab one.

A show-cause notice has been slapped on Xiaomi India following recovery of documents during searches on its premises that indicated remittance of royalty and licence fee to US and Chinese firms under contractual obligations, the union finance ministry said on Wednesday.

Replying to an email query, a Xiaomi spokesperson said, ""At Xiaomi India, we give utmost importance to ensuring we comply with all Indian laws.

""We are currently reviewing the notice in detail.

""As a responsible company, we will support the authorities with all necessary documentation.""

Evidence gathered during investigations by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufacturers were including the amount of royalty paid by the firm in the assessable value of the goods imported by the company and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of the customs law, the ministry said.

By not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" in the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading customs duty, being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof, it added.

""After completion of the investigation by the DRI, three show cause notices have been issued to M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited for demand and recovery of duty amounting to Rs. 653 crore for the period April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962,"" the finance ministry said.

During the investigations, it further emerged that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by the firm and its contract manufacturers.

Investigations further showed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by the company or assembled in India by importing components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India.

The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

The DRI officials had received intelligence input that M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited (Xiaomi India) was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, following which an investigation was initiated by DRI against the company and its contract manufacturers.

During the investigation, searches were conducted by DRI at the premises of Xiaomi India, and the issue of remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd came to light.

Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments, it said.","{'uri': 'rediff.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Rediff.com India Ltd.'}",[],https://im.rediff.com/money/2021/apr/16xiaomi-01.jpg,0.3176470588235294,,True,0,0.3176470588235294,379094760,2

It's not all about the design, though, as there's some great news on the software front too.

Buy the Skagen Falster Gen 6 now, and it comes with Google's Wear OS software installed, but Fossil has confirmed the smartwatch will get the new Wear OS 3 software update in 2022, meaning that even though the software is a little old now, you can buy it with confidence that it won't stagnate when others around it are running the latest software. The one caveat here is that there's no exact date on when the update will arrive, but based on Google's statements when Wear OS 3 launched, it's likely to be during the second half of 2022.

There are six different models in the new Falster range, each separated by case and strap color. You can choose between a classic black case, a silver case, a rose-gold case, or a stylish charcoal shade. Skagen's excellent stainless steel mesh strap is an option, along with a silicone or leather strap, meaning there's a good chance there will be a version that appeals to you. The case is made from either stainless steel or hard-wearing nylon, plus the crown rotates to help navigate through the software.

Ever since the original OnePlus One launched in 2014, specs have always been a critical part of the OnePlus experience. From snappy processors, high-resolution displays, and fast charging speeds, OnePlus smartphones often have some of the biggest numbers on their spec sheets.

This was perfectly evident last year with the OnePlus 9 Pro. OnePlus's 2021 flagship touted a Snapdragon 888 chipset, 12GB of RAM, a 4500 mAh battery, and 60W wired charging -- just to name a few of its main talking points. The end result was one of the better Android smartphones available last year, even if it was overshadowed a bit by the Galaxy S21 Ultra and Pixel 6 Pro.

One day after confirming the existence of the OnePlus 10 Pro and revealing its official design, OnePlus is now sharing the phone's specifications. Right off the bat, it's touting Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor. This is the successor to last year's Snapdragon 888 and offers a CPU that's 16-perfect faster, a 30-percent performance boost to the GPU, and a 25-percent reduction in overall power use. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 also has an upgraded image signal processor, allowing smartphone cameras to capture significantly more data than before.

Additional OnePlus 10 Pro Specs You Should Know

OnePlus has also confirmed a few enticing battery details. Not only is the OnePlus 10 Pro's batterty capacity increased to 5000 mAh, but wired charging speeds also now go up to 80W. Wireless charging remains at the same 50W speed, and just like last year, reverse wireless charging is present, too. OnePlus is also touting things like a 120Hz AMOLED display with LTPO technology (with improved calibration), LPDDR5 RAM, and UFS 3.1 storage.

Another important element is the camera system. The OnePlus 10 Pro will have the ""Second-generation Hasselblad Camera for Mobile"" -- consisting of a 48MP primary camera, 50MP ultra-wide camera, and an 8MP telephoto camera. Those are the exact same megapixel counts as the OnePlus 9 Pro's cameras, but that's not to say there won't be any improvements (whether it be new software processing or smaller changes to the sensors). Other confirmed specs include dual stereo speakers, Bluetooth 5.2, and dimensions of 163 x 73.9 x 8.55mm.

As announced yesterday, the OnePlus 10 Pro is slated to launch on January 11 in China and then followed by other markets later on. Pricing and additional availability still remain a mystery, but now knowing the 10 Pro's design and main specs, the phone is gradually coming together. So long as OnePlus can get the cost right, this could easily be one of 2021's most interesting smartphones.

,6875303961,,eng,2022-01-05T16:03:00Z,2022-01-05T16:00:00Z,news,https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22864897/fossil-razer-skagen-gen-6-smartwatch-wear-os,Fossil activates gamer mode with a Razer smartwatch,"Fossil usually shows up to CES with a hoard of smartwatches, but last year was a weird one for Wear OS. Google and Samsung announced a new unified version of Wear OS, but the catch was that non-Samsung watches -- including Fossil's -- won't be eligible for an upgrade until mid to late 2022. Given the circumstances, this year, Fossil is keeping it relatively simple with a limited-edition Razer smartwatch and an updated version of the Skagen Falster.

Before you ask, no, the Razer X Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch does not come with RGB lighting. It does, however, come with three Razer-branded watch faces -- including a ""Chroma"" face that you can customize to match Razer's other Chroma products. It's technically not RGB, but you can enable ""breathe"" and ""wave"" lighting patterns, so it's the next best thing. The other two are more subtle. One is an analog face with the Razer logo, the other spells out the time in a Razer-inspired font. The 44mm watch comes with a matte black case and two interchangeable straps: black and a spectacularly neon green.

That's pretty much the extent of what makes this a ""gamer"" smartwatch unless you count the fact that there'll only be 1,337 of these available for purchase. While Garmin launched an esports fitness watch in late 2020 that lets you track esports activities and stream your biometrics on Twitch, you shouldn't expect that here. The Razer X Fossil smartwatch is basically the same as the Gen 6, which means it's a Wear OS watch with a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chip. It's got also got a 1.28-inch color touchscreen, built-in GPS, and contactless payments. Like Fossil's other watches, it's capable of fast charging, meaning you can get 80 percent battery in 30 minutes.

Fossil demurred as to whether it would re-release the watch if it proved popular, saying that nothing was 100 percent planned. However, it didn't rule out collaborating with Razer again down the line. As for why Razer wanted to collaborate on a smartwatch, Fossil says it ties back into the gaming company's recent efforts to promote mental health and wellness in e-sports. (And who can forget that Razer also once tried to launch its own ill-fated line of fitness bands and a not-so-smart smartwatch?)

If the Razer watch is a gamer version of the Gen 6, the new Skagen Falster is the Gen 6 with a Danish minimalism veneer. The main upgrade here is it adds the 4100+ chip and six colorways. That's not entirely nothing. Fossil says the more powerful 4100+ chip meant it was possible to cram more features while maintaining the Falster's 42mm case size. In a world where smartwatches keep getting bigger, it's refreshing to see a watch stay small.

Both watches feature the same health features -- a new SpO2 sensor, sleep tracking, and Fossil's new Wellness app. The 4100+'s greater power efficiency also means you can finally use Fossil smartwatches for sleep tracking, though you still have to charge daily. They both also have 3ATM of water resistance, meaning they're safe enough for the shower and rainy days but not entirely swim-proof. (You generally want 5ATM of water resistance for the pool.)

I got to spend some time with both the Razer watch and the new Skagen Falster -- the 4100-chip does make a significant difference in performance and battery life over the 3100-powered Gen 5 watches. Design-wise, the Falster looks quite nice on the wrist, but it's also not that different from the Falster 3. My unit came with a metal woven strap, and while it was stylish, it wasn't ideal for working out or sleeping in. The Razer watch is also a handsome smartwatch, though the 44mm case was a bit big on my wrist. The neon green strap was also too loud for my taste and a little unnecessary, given that most of the pizzazz comes from the Razer watch faces. That said, if you want your smartwatch to match your mechanical keyboard, this should fit the bill.

The main thing to note is that both watches are currently running the outdated Wear OS 2. The upside is that since both are powered by the 4100+ platform, so they'll be eligible to upgrade to Wear OS 3 later this year (aka whenever it is that Google gets around to pushing out the update). It is, however, awkward timing when Samsung's watches are already out there running the new Wear OS and there are rumors that Google's working on a Pixel Watch for 2022 -- a fact that Fossil has admitted to hindering initial Gen 6 sales.

The 1,337 Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatches will retail for $329 and will be available later this month at Fossil, Razer, and GameStop's websites. Meanwhile, all versions of the Skagen Falster Gen 6 will retail for $295 this month.","{'uri': 'theverge.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Verge'}","[{'uri': 'victoria_song@theverge.com', 'name': 'Victoria Song', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-YJjwIRBO9Do7QOU57xmg8oDY6w=/0x244:2040x1264/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144716/vsong_211229_4952_0015_Recovered.jpg,0.09019607843137245,eng-7386037,False,0.8901960849761963,0.09019607843137245,379094580,1

Not that Razer hadn't created a limited edition product before they released products with A Bathing Ape in late 2020, but since then, Razer's co-branding adventures have felt all the more natural in a ""limited edition release event"" sort of way. The latest example is the Razer X Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch, a device that'll be released in a very limited edition of 1337.

The number 1337 is the stock symbol for Razer on the Hong Kong Stock exchange. It's also a classic bit of gamer history, translating from 1337 to LEET to elite. A gaming brand made by gamers for gamers keeps an orthographically encoded message of love for the original meme close to their heart.

The Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch works with a 44mm case size and a 1.28-inch touchscreen display (with a resolution of 326 PPI). This device connects with Bluetooth 5.0 LE, Wi-Fi (for internet), GPS, and NFC SE. As it is with the original, this watch has buttons and dials that are customization-friendly.

Inside the watch is 8GB data storage alongside 1GB RAM. Sensors in this watch include Ambient Light, off-body IR (!), SpO2, PPG Heart Rate monitor, Altimeter, Compass, Gyroscope, and an Accelerometer for good measure. Charging of the internal battery in this watch is handled by 4-pin USB fast charging with an included magnetic puck.

The Razer X Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch will be released with two interchangeable straps and three ""exclusive"" Razer watch faces. One watchface each for analog, Text, and Chroma will be included with this watch.

This smartwatch will work with Wear OS by Google, giving it the ability to run most features on its own or connected to an Android or iOS smartphone. The base Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch was the first to be released with the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100+ platform.

The Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch without Razer branding was released September of 2021 without the ""limited edition"" component attached to this Razer brand device. The co-branded Razer X Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch will be released before the end of January, 2022, for a price of approximately $329 USD.","{'uri': 'slashgear.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SlashGear'}",[],https://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/razerwatch2222.jpg?w=640,0.3019607843137255,eng-7386037,False,0.8078431487083435,0.3019607843137255,379094580,1

Three show-cause notices have been issued to Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited for demand and recovery of duty amounting to Rs 653 crore for the period 01.04.2017 to 30.06.2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962.

Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited (Xiaomi India) was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, an investigation was initiated by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) against Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.

During the investigation, searches were conducted by the DRI at the premises of Xiaomi India, which led to the recovery of incriminating documents indicating that Xiaomi India was remitting royalty and licence fees to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., under contractual obligation. Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments.

During the investigations, it further emerged that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.

The investigations conducted by the DRI further showed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in India by importing parts and components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India. The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

Evidence gathered during the investigations by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufactures were including the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 and Customs valuation (determination of the value of imported goods) Rules 2007. By not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading Customs duty being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof.","{'uri': 'thestatesman.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Statesman'}",[],https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/6769e70b8ff19c22c6c12a03436dd819.jpg,0.1450980392156862,eng-7385274,False,0.9764705896377563,0.1450980392156862,379094520,2

-- Slow going: The Justice Department and White House are at odds over whether the slate of candidates for top staff jobs in the antitrust division is diverse enough.

-- Death threat by tweet: One year after the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, email and social media have fueled a spike in threats against lawmakers to an all-time high.

-- Evolving extremism: White supremacists and nationalist groups have tweaked their online tactics over the past year, according to a pair of new reports.

DOJ'S POKY ANTITRUST STAFFING -- Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Jonathan Kanter has started his new job, but his ""front office"" -- the deputies and staffers who help run the division -- isn't yet in place because of disagreements over whether Kanter's proposed staff picks are diverse enough, two people familiar with the discussions told MT.

The selection of DOJ's antitrust deputies is a delicate negotiation between the White House and DOJ. In previous administrations, top deputies often started work even before the Senate had confirmed the department's top antitrust official. But the Biden White House has opposed filling slots piecemeal, the people said, and instead wants to OK the entire slate in one go. The Information first reported on the delay. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

So who's in the running? Those in contention for top jobs include:

-- Sally Hubbard, a former antitrust official for New York state who has spent the past three years at the anti-monopoly advocacy group Open Markets Institute.

-- Michael Kades, a longtime FTC staffer who worked on detail for Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) before joining the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.

-- Eric Citron, a partner at the appellate and Supreme Court litigation firm Goldstein & Russell, who helped represent Qualcomm in its recent win against the FTC.

-- Josh Tzuker, a senior policy adviser to Oracle and one-time adviser to former FTC Commissioner (and former Biden aide) Terrell McSweeny.

-- Andrew Forman, a former colleague of Kanter's at the law firms Paul Weiss and Cadwalader.

-- Sarah Oxenham Allen, a 20-year antitrust veteran in the Virginia attorney general's office and current chair of the antitrust task force at the National Association of Attorneys General -- a group that helped to coordinate the cases against Google and Facebook behind the scenes.

The only problem? All those individuals are white, and four are men -- not a great look for an administration that has prided itself on diversity. At the moment, Kanter has appointed Doha Mekki as his acting principal deputy. A Black woman born in Sudan whose family sought asylum in the U.S., Mekki has spent seven years at DOJ, most recently helming the agency's initiative to combat no-hire pacts and wage-fixing among companies. Keeping Mekki in a top role could help assuage some of the White House's concerns about the rest of the proposed slate.

WHITE HOUSE KEEPS FCC, FTC NOMINATIONS IN PLAY -- The White House on Tuesday formally sent its nominations of Gigi Sohn for FCC commissioner and Alvaro Bedoya for FTC commissioner back to the Senate, a move MT previously reported was in the works. The renominations show that despite GOP blowback surrounding both picks, the administration is committed to trying to advance them.

-- And don't worry about NTIA: Although an administration official initially described plans to re-up National Telecommunications and Information Administration pick Alan Davidson too, there's actually no need. A Senate agreement kept his nomination in what's known as status quo; now all three nominations are ready for further Senate consideration.

LAWMAKER THREATS JUMP -- The Capitol Police logged some 9,600 threats against members of Congress last year, a 20 percent jump over the previous year. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger disclosed the number, normally not released to the public, to reporters Tuesday during a news conference about the safety of the Capitol ahead of the one year anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot.

That number includes calls, emails and social media posts, though not all of them rose to the level of a crime, Manger said. The Capitol Police are most alarmed by people who make repeated threats, rather than anonymous emails or social media statements, he said.

Manger didn't break down where most of the threats came from. But Facebook users made as many as 10,000 posts a day with baseless claims about the election and calls for political violence in the leadup to the insurrection, a joint investigation published Tuesday by the Washington Post and ProPublica found. The news orgs discovered 650,000 posts in public groups between Election Day and Jan. 6 -- a figure that's likely an undercount because it excludes private groups and posts.

Facebook parent company Meta rejected the idea that its platform should bear the blame for the violence.

""The notion that the January 6 insurrection would not have happened but for Facebook is absurd,"" Meta spokesperson Drew Pusateri said. ""The former President of the United States pushed a narrative that the election was stolen, including in-person a short distance from the Capitol building that day. The responsibility for the violence that occurred on January 6 lies with those who attacked our Capitol and those who encouraged them.""

HOW EXTREMISTS HAVE ORGANIZED SINCE JAN. 6 -- Just ahead of the anniversary of the Capitol Hill riots, the Atlantic Council's DFR Lab is out with a report about how white supremacists and nationalist groups fractured -- and then built themselves up again -- over the last 12 months. Not all of this activity happened online. But as Covid-19 restrictions kicked in again and major social media platforms began to crack down, many groups scattered themselves across a number of social networks.

-- The good news: None of these extremist groups managed to carry out anything like the Jan. 6 insurrection, mostly thanks to a combination of law enforcement actions and infighting among these notoriously paranoid groups. Conspiracy theories ran rife that subsequent far-right extremist rallies were actually organized by antifascists and left-wing activists or were efforts by the federal government to round up those involved in the Jan. 6 riots.

-- The bad news: The last 12 months has led to a growing sophistication in these groups' online tactics. These tactics include the increased use of encrypted messaging apps to avoid detection, coordinated digital campaigns against what these domestic extremists view as threats and a deep-rooted belief in the debunked conspiracy that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump.

""There have been evolutions. There have been different tactics. But we've got a growing political violence problem in this country, and that's not going away,"" Graham Brookie, DFR Lab's director, told MT.

More reading: The Tech Transparency Project also issued a report finding Facebook has been a breeding ground for extremist militia groups in the year since the Jan. 6 insurrection.

-- A separate report out today found that Parler and other alternative tech platforms that cater to conservatives played critical roles in driving election misinformation leading up to the Jan. 6 insurrection, according to data studied by the tech policy think tank New America, Arizona State University and the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University.

The report finds that the loose moderation standards on Parler have made it a hotbed for dis- and misinformation and conspiracy theories, and Parler 1.0 -- the first version of the platform, before it was taken offline by Amazon on Jan. 10, 2021 -- had ""a networked effect on the information ecosystem that, left unchecked, will likely continue to reverberate far into the future of American democracy.""

Although Parler has a smaller reach than more mainstream platforms, increased content moderation actions by Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple and Google have driven more users to join Parler since its founding in 2018, along with other alternative platforms.

-- Congressional impact: A third of the 147 members of Congress who raised an objection to the 2020 Electoral College count have joined Parler. Content from lawmakers posted on the original Parler site received millions of impressions each day before the platform was taken offline by Amazon.

In a 5 January media statement, the country's finance ministry said the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), which investigated the matter, has issued three so-called show cause notices to Xiaomi Technology India for the ""demand and recovery"" of duties amounting to INR6.53bn ($87.82m).

Xiaomi India is currently reviewing the notice, an unidentified spokesperson told Reuters.

""...searches were conducted by the DRI at the premises of Xiaomi India, which led to the recovery of incriminating documents indicating that Xiaomi India was remitting royalty and licence fees to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software, under contractual obligation.

""Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments,"" the statement said.

Evidence gathered showed that ""neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufactures were including the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 and Customs valuation (determination of value of imported goods) Rules 2007.

""By not adding 'royalty and licence fee' into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading Customs duty being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof"", it added.

Smartphone shipments in the sub-continent slid 5% year over year during the three-month period that ended on 30 September 2021, to 47.5 million units, as vendors battled supply issues for low-end models, according to market analyst Canalys.

Ltd., China, the same was not being added to the assessable value of the goods imported

The Finance Ministry on Wednesday issued three show-cause notices to Chinese phone maker Xiaomi's India unit 'Xiaomi Technology India' for evading customs duty by way of undervaluation. With notices, the tax authorities are demanding Rs 653 crore in tax from the company. This is after a detailed investigation was initiated by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) against Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.

The DRI recovered documents at the premises of Xiaomi India indicating that the company was remitting royalty and license fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., under contractual obligation. But the same was not reported by the company, evading import duty. ""By not adding royalty and licence fee in the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading customs duty, being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof"", the ministry said in its official statement.

The investigation by DRI revealed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by the company or assembled in India by importing components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India. ""The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement"", the statement added.

The probe found that while Xiaomi India was paying royalty and licence fees to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., China for the components and mobile phones imported to India, the same was not being added to the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers. This is a violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 and Customs valuation (determination of value of imported goods) Rules 2007, the Finance Ministry said.

Therefore, three show cause notices have been issued to M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited for demand and recovery of duty amounting to Rs. 653 crore for the period 01.04.2017 to 30.06.2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962, the ministry informed.

It is said that the key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers have confirmed the payments. This is a week after the Income Tax Department had indicated that Chinese mobile phone manufacturers Xiaomi and Oppo might face fines of up to Rs 1,000 crore for violating the law.

The Income Tax Department had conducted searches on leading Chinese mobile companies across the country on December 21. The searches were conducted in offices of Oppo, Xiaomi, and One Plus in Delhi and 11 states including, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Assam, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bihar, Rajasthan.

The severe search by the Office then had revealed that two major companies have made remittance in the nature of royalty, to and on behalf of its group companies located abroad, which aggregates to more than Rs 5500 crore. ""These companies have not complied with the regulatory mandate prescribed under the Income-tax Act, 1961 for disclosure of transactions with associated enterprises. Such lapse makes them liable for penal action under the Income-tax Act, 1961, the quantum of which could be in the range of more than Rs 1000 crore"", the statement had read.","{'uri': 'opindia.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'OpIndia'}",[],https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/32.png,0.2078431372549019,eng-7385274,False,0.9137254953384399,0.2078431372549019,379092720,2

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told a crowd at CES 2022 that his company will develop a custom Snapdragon chip for lightweight augmented reality glasses by Microsoft. The chip will use software from both companies -- Microsoft Mesh and the Qualcomm Snapdragon Spaces XR development platform.

""We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale,"" Amon said. ""I'm very excited about this partnership. It's a step in making that a reality and gaining more and more scale with augmented reality.""

Amon made the announcement during one of the few in-person press conferences held during CES 2022 in Las Vegas. Because of the spread of the omicron variant of COVID-19, the conference held physical and online-only events. Several major companies also dropped out of physically attending CES 2022, including Amazon, T-Mobile and Microsoft.

[RELATED: CES 2022: Announcements, News, And Product Coverage]

Amon focused his CES 2022 talk on Qualcomm's innovations in the auto industry, promising to take lessons from growing market share in the mobile space into a new arena.

""If you look at what was the success of Qualcomm in mobile, unlike some of our competitors that have been focused on providing a component into an OEM, Qualcomm has been involved in every single aspect of mobile,"" Amon said. ""From standards -- early on, on standards -- regulatory, mobile and telecoms, highly regulated environments.""

He continued: ""We have the ability to create horizontal platforms that companies can innovate on top of. We just apply the same recipe to automotive because the similarities are incredibly remarkable.""

When asked about the possibility of bringing Microsoft Mesh into cars, Amon expressed interest.

""I can see why augmented reality could benefit you -- for example, as you wear glasses, you get information that is delivered to you that gets superimposed on your reality -- I can see that could be also capabilities that you can have on display in a car,"" Amon said. ""So I think it's fair to assume that could be an interesting evolution as now the car is part of the network and is connected.""

When asked by CRN about the business opportunity around augmented reality, Amon said technicians might use AR glasses to view a digital twin of a car before working on it. Workers can use AR glasses for research and training.

""Digital twins are a reality as we think about a cloud-connected economy,"" he said. ""And you have the ability when you connect the physical world with the digital world to have incredible use cases. This is how the metaverse is going to take shape.""

In response to CRN's question about the business opportunity in virtual reality, Amon discussed Qualcomm's work with utility companies to build digital twins of substations to help with 5G and Internet of Things solutions. He said the need for Qualcomm only grows as more companies invest in digital twins of conference rooms and social networks.

""That's the role of Qualcomm into the metaverse. That's why we're the ticket to the metaverse,"" he said. ""We're the gateway that connects the physical to the digital world with the devices that we build that allow you to have a virtual reality, augmented reality experience.""

Microsoft unveiled its Mesh mixed reality platform during its Ignite 2021 conference. At the time, CEO Satya Nadella compared Mesh's expected effect on mixed reality to what Xbox Live did for gaming.

He talked about engineers using Mesh to collaborate on 3-D models in a virtual space and company gatherings for remote workers. Mesh runs on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and integrates with Microsoft's HoloLens 2 mixed reality headset.

In November, Microsoft announced plans to launch a preview of Mesh-enabled capabilities for Teams users on PC, mobile and mixed-reality headsets in the first half of 2022.

Across the Microsoft cloud, ""from Azure IoT, to Azure Digital Twins, to Connected Spaces and Microsoft Mesh, we are building ... the metaverse platform for you to build upon,"" Nadella said during Ignite Fall 2021. ""In a sense, the metaverse enables us to embed computing into the real world, and to embed the real world into computing, bringing real presence to any digital space. For years, we've talked about creating this digital representation of the world. But now we actually have the opportunity to go into that world and participate in it.""

Users will have the ability to share and collaborate spatially on existing Microsoft 365 documents, presentations and content, according to the company. Users can make avatars for meetings and make them express emotions with live reactions. Organizations also can create branded immersive spaces that look like conference rooms, design centers and networking lounges.","{'uri': 'crn.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CRN'}","[{'uri': 'wade_tyler_millward@crn.com', 'name': 'Wade Tyler Millward', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.crn.com/resources/0271-14211b52572f-7fa46183d2c9-1000/qualcomm-cristiano-amon-ces.jpg,0.2313725490196079,eng-7383810,False,0.615686297416687,0.2313725490196079,379090860,6

The DRI officials had received intelligence input that M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited (Xiaomi India) was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, following which an investigation was initiated by DRI against the company and its contract manufacturers. During the investigation, searches were conducted by DRI at the premises of Xiaomi India, and the issue of remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd came to light.

Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments, it said.","{'uri': 'ndtv.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NDTV'}","[{'uri': 'animesh_singh@ndtv.com', 'name': 'Animesh Singh', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-11/lvo4501g_xiaomi-to-open-car-plant-in-beijing-with-annual-output-of-300000-vehicles-report_625x300_27_November_21.jpg?ver-20211223.02,0.2705882352941176,eng-7385274,False,0.9490196108818054,0.2705882352941176,379090560,2

First revealed in November 2021, Microsoft Pluton is designed to bring Xbox-level security to Windows PCs, offering physical protections against attacks. As an extension of Microsoft's Trusted Platform Module programme, the hardware needs to be built in, which is why we're only now seeing the benefits.

The rollout has now begun, starting with the new AMD Ryzen 6000 series unveiled at CES 2022.

AMD security boost

Microsoft developed Pluton alongside Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm, marking a unified effort to help secure PCs going forward.

""Our vision for the future of Windows PCs is security at the very core, built into the CPU, where hardware and software are tightly integrated in a unified approach designed to eliminate entire vectors of attack,"" Microsoft said.

Security has often proved a weakness for Windows PCs, mostly because of their sheer popularity. Mac and Linux have been protected by having very low levels of market share. But that brings greater responsibility for Microsoft and Pluton is one answer.

While anyone who buys a PC with a Ryzen 6000 inside gets the protection, the first actual laptops come from Lenovo, in the form of the ThinkPad Z13 and Z16. As time goes on, more and more OEMs will include Pluton.

In some ways, the most surprising news is that AMD beat Intel and Qualcomm to the punch with integrating Pluton into a chipset.

At CES on Wednesday, HMD Global (the company that owns Nokia) announced a number of new phones for the budget market and laid out its US sales strategy for the next two years.

The Nokia C100 4G is the company's entry-level smartphone, coming in at just under $100. It sports a Helio A22 chipset, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage.

At $119, the Nokia C200 4G has a lot in common with the C100 4G. It has the same MediaTek A22 chipset and 4GB of RAM, but you get a slightly larger display and double the storage for the extra $20.

If you've become accustomed to Nokia's recent design language, the G100 4G is a notable departure. The $149 phone eschews the round camera module, replacing it with slim vertical camera stack. It features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.

HMD's priciest offering, the Nokia G400 5G, makes 5G accessible at just $239. The G400 5G has the same design as the G100, but sports a beefier Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G chipset, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. It also has a 6.7-inch LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate.

There's even a feature phone in the mix. The $79 Nokia 2760 Flip 4G is made with simplicity in mind. The LTE-enabled flip phone sports dual displays, a large keypad, and other features that make it an attractive choice for children and seniors.

The Nokia 2760 Flip 4G will feature the latest version of KaiOS, while the smartphones will ship with Android 12, though a Nokia representative said none of the upcoming phones will be part of the Android One program. That, along with the fact most of the handsets are being released through prepaid carriers, means there's no guarantee for future OS upgrades and they'll likely be loaded with a fair share of bloatware.

The company said it is pivoting to the budget market for the next two years. It will also expand its current carrier partnerships with T-Mobile and TracFone to include Consumer Cellular and Dish Wireless. In fact, it appears that nearly every Nokia phone announced for the first half of 2022 will only be available through carriers initially (as opposed to unlocked).

The Nokia 2760 Flip 4G will be a TracFone exclusive, coming in the first quarter of the year. Consumer Cellular and TracFone will begin selling the Nokia C100 4G in the first quarter as well. HMD didn't announce any carrier partnerships for the Nokia C200 4G, but you can expect to see it in the spring.

Boost and TracFone will be the first to offer the Nokia G100 4G, while the Nokia G400 5G will be available through most prepaid carriers. Both phones will go on sale this spring.

While the company was excited to announce its new phones and sales strategy, it was short on additional details about the phones themselves. The specifications we've listed above are from a pre-briefing the company held with reporters in December. We'll update this story with additional specs and details as they're released.","{'uri': 'sea.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag Asia'}","[{'uri': 'smartphones@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'smartphones', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'he_covered_mobile@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'He Covered Mobile', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_ap/news/n/nokia-is-d/nokia-is-doubling-down-on-affordable-smartphones-at-ces_2vsq.1200.jpg,0.04313725490196085,,True,0,0.04313725490196085,379089600,2

Qualcomm and Microsoft announced at CES 2022 that they would go beyond working on PC chips and partner on a series of augmented reality (AR) initiatives. That includes developing custom chips for AR glasses.

Qualcomm detailed the partnership in a blog post (via Engadget), although it didn't share much about the chips or the end products. All we got was a promise of ""lightweight"" and energy-efficient glasses.

Aside from developing chips, there was also a focus on software. The collaboration will use Microsoft's 'Mesh' virtual collaboration tool and Qualcomm's Snapdragon Spaces XR development platform. The companies didn't specify which platforms they would support, but chances are the support will include Windows and likely Android.

The Microsoft-Qualcomm team-up shouldn't be much of a surprise. The two companies have partnered on things like ARM chips for PCs (although rumour has it that deal may end soon) and Microsoft uses custom Qualcomm chips in its Surface Pro X devices. Plus, Microsoft already has its HoloLens AR tech, and it has wanted to make that more accessible for a while.

Couple that with the ongoing hype about the metaverse and the push to AR technology to fuel meetings, and it seems like the right time for Microsoft and Qualcomm to partner on AR tech.","{'uri': 'mobilesyrup.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MobileSyrup'}",[],https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm-microsoft-header-scaled.jpg,0.1529411764705881,eng-7383810,False,0.7647058963775635,0.1529411764705881,379089480,5

This includes fundamentals such as the chipsets in use or all the camera details. As such, it's tough to gauge whether these phones are good value for money or overpriced devices of which you should steer clear.

Starting with the most capable device of the lot, the Nokia G400 is the only 5G phone announced today. You're getting a solid proposition here on paper, namely 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a 6.6-inch 120Hz LCD screen, and a 5,000mAh battery. According to Phandroid, the phone is powered by a Snapdragon 480 SoC, which is a budget 5G chipset that should still deliver a good everyday experience.

Moving down a step we've got the Nokia G100. This brings a 6.5-inch HD+ LCD panel, a 5,000mAh battery, and a triple rear camera setup. Phandroid asserts the G100 is powered by the Snapdragon 615 processor. If confirmed, that would mean HMD is using a budget processor that's over five years old. Qualcomm first announced the Snapdragon 615 in 2014.

If confirmed, HMD using this chipset would be incredibly perplexing. Instead, it could've simply chosen a more recent (but still old) chipset such as the Snapdragon 439, Snapdragon 450, or Mediatek's Helio A and P series. Either way, we wouldn't expect many Android version updates with this phone if the Snapdragon 615 is indeed on board.

Meanwhile, the Nokia C200 has a recommended price tag of $119 and the Nokia C100 will set you back $99. The C200 is slated for a Q2 launch window as well, while the C100 arrives in Q1 2022.

The company also announced a new flip phone, dubbed the Nokia 2760 Flip. This 4G device is powered by the KaiOS smart feature platform and will retail for $79.

Nevertheless, if one thing is for sure, it's that you should probably stay away from the G100 in particular if it's using the Snapdragon 615. Even other ~$150 (or cheaper) smartphones like the Redmi 9A and the firm's previous Nokia G10 would be offering more modern SoCs. And these newer chips offer support for faster cellular speeds, updated GPUs, and more efficient manufacturing processes.","{'uri': 'androidauthority.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Authority'}",[],https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nokia-phones-CES-2022.jpg,0.1215686274509804,eng-7385699,False,0.7176470756530762,0.1215686274509804,379089180,1

The latest development shows that the Indian government has slapped the Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi with Rs 653 crore notice for tax evasion.

As per reports, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has issued three cause notices to Xiaomi India for recovery of Rs 653 crore for the period 01.04.2017 to 30.06.2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962.

In the last month, the DRI conducted several searches at the Xiaomi India office as well as at its supplier's factory. The report suggests that DRI recovered incriminating documents from the premises of Xiaomi India, which indicated that the company remitted royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software, under contractual obligation.

""Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments,"" the Finance Ministry noted.

The ministry further highlighted that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software, China were not added to the transaction value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.

The DRI investigation discovered that ""Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in India by importing parts and components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India.""

DRI further highlighted that neither Xiaomi India nor the contract manufacturers were adding the royalty amount paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturer. This is a clear violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 and Customs valuation (determination of value of imported goods) Rules 2007.

The Finance Ministry explained that by not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was ""evading Customs duty being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts, and components thereof"".

'Qualcomm Announces Collaboration with Microsoft to Expand and Accelerate AR to Usher in New Gateways to the Metaverse,' heralded the press release. New gateways eh? Sounds intriguing. Both companies are 'believers in the metaverse', were told, thus positioning it as some kind of mystical phenomenon rather than a rebrand of the AR/VR paradigm the tech industry has been trying to get off the ground for years.

Qualcomm itself coined the term 'XR' (extended reality) a while back, as a way of trying to generate demand for a new family of chips designed to cater to that sort of thing. The fact that it's now resorting to this partnership with Microsoft seems to be an indication that it thinks the whole scheme needs a boost.

""This collaboration reflects the next step in both companies' shared commitment to XR and the metaverse,"" said Hugo Swart, GM of XR at Qualcomm. ""Qualcomm Technologies' core XR strategy has always been delivering the most cutting-edge technology, purpose-built XR chipsets and enabling the ecosystem with our software platforms and hardware reference designs. We are thrilled to work with Microsoft to help expand and scale the adoption of AR hardware and software across the entire industry.""

""Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation,"" said Rubén Caballero, Corporate VP of Mixed Reality at Microsoft. ""With services like Microsoft Mesh, we are committed to delivering the safest and most comprehensive set of capabilities to power metaverses that blend the physical and digital worlds, ultimately delivering a shared sense of presence across devices. We look forward to working with Qualcomm Technologies to help the entire ecosystem unlock the promise of the metaverse.""

All this talk of alternative realities is a bit unnerving, isn't it? And the fact that the Microsoft gentleman felt the need to emphasis things like trust and safety only serves to strengthen that impression. Here's Qualcomm's CES announcement fest, with one in question starting at the 16:50 mark, followed by some videos illustrating the Microsoft vision of all this. You decide for yourself what a great idea it all is.","{'uri': 'telecoms.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Telecoms.com'}",[],https://telecoms.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2022/01/Qualcomm-CES-2022.jpg,0.2,eng-7383810,False,0.7372549176216125,0.2,379088520,5

The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is leaking left, right and center right now, and the latest leak suggests the phone will come with a new feature called a Super Clear Lens on the rear camera.

This is according to YouTuber XEETECHCARE, who provided a datasheet for the upcoming phone that has also been nodded to by leaker Ice Universe as an accurate leak.

Much of what the infographic shares has been seen in previous leaks, but a new tidbit is the terminology of a Super Clear Lens on the phone's main camera.

The graphic doesn't go into much detail, but it suggests this is a feature where Samsung has included Gorilla Glass technology on the camera to reduce reflection and glare in your shots.

Exactly how this will work in practice is currently unclear, and it seems from this leak that it'll just be specifically for the phone's main camera. This won't be accessible on the telephoto or ultra-wide cameras.

The rest of the specs here are similar to what we've heard before, with the phone apparently featuring a 108MP f/1.8 main camera, two 10MP telephoto cameras and an ultra-wide 12MP f/2.2 shooter. It also says there will be a 40MP camera on the front of the phone.

Other elements mentioned by the infographic include the choice of either 8GB or 12GB of RAM, plus storage choices of 128GB, 256GB or 512GB. It also says the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra will come with a 5,000mAh battery.

It says the phone will weigh 228g, feature a 6.8-inch QHD+ display (that's 3080 x 1440) as well as including an embedded S Pen, and come in four colors. Those shades are listed as Phantom Black, Phantom White, Green and Burgundy, as seen in previous leaks.

The processor listed for this handset is the Exynos 2200, which likely means this is a spec list for the European and Asian models rather than the one set to be available in the US. We currently expect those in the US to get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset in their phones.

This infographic is fan-made with leaked information, so it's unlikely that it'll be included in a similar way on Samsung's final marketing material. That said, it wouldn't surprise us if Samsung made this new Super Clear Lens a big part of the Galaxy S22 Ultra's marketing push.

The brand has done similar before with the Galaxy S21 marketing focusing on the S21 Ultra's telephoto camera. It may do similar on this run of new handsets, but this time with Super Clear Lens.

Glare and reflections aren't a huge nuisance in mobile photography, though, so it's unlikely to be a reason why you'll upgrade to this phone if you already own a relatively modern handset.

It would be a nice to have feature, but it's far from a reason to immediately upgrade.

However, smartphone cameras are nearing a point where improvements are minor as they're already fantastic. This is likely another way of Samsung making smaller improvements with each iteration rather than an attempt to change the game entirely.","{'uri': 'techradar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechRadar'}","[{'uri': 'james_peckham@techradar.com', 'name': 'James Peckham', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K45AkGuh3uJL88GkrzkCbJ-1200-80.jpg,0.07450980392156858,eng-7385191,False,0.615686297416687,0.07450980392156858,379088520,1

At CES on Wednesday, HMD Global (the company that owns Nokia) announced a number of new phones for the budget market and laid out its US sales strategy for the next two years.

The Nokia C100 4G is the company's entry-level smartphone, coming in at just under $100. It sports a Helio A22 chipset, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage.

At $119, the Nokia C200 4G has a lot in common with the C100 4G. It has the same MediaTek A22 chipset and 4GB of RAM, but you get a slightly larger display and double the storage for the extra $20.

If you've become accustomed to Nokia's recent design language, the G100 4G is a notable departure. The $149 phone eschews the round camera module, replacing it with slim vertical camera stack. It features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.

HMD's priciest offering, the Nokia G400 5G, makes 5G accessible at just $239. The G400 5G has the same design as the G100, but sports a beefier Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G chipset, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. It also has a 6.7-inch LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate.

There's even a feature phone in the mix. The $79 Nokia 2760 Flip 4G is made with simplicity in mind. The LTE-enabled flip phone sports dual displays, a large keypad, and other features that make it an attractive choice for children and seniors.

The Nokia 2760 Flip 4G will feature the latest version of KaiOS, while the smartphones will ship with Android 12, though a Nokia representative said none of the upcoming phones will be part of the Android One program. That, along with the fact most of the handsets are being released through prepaid carriers, means there's no guarantee for future OS upgrades and they'll likely be loaded with a fair share of bloatware.

The company said it is pivoting to the budget market for the next two years. It will also expand its current carrier partnerships with T-Mobile and TracFone to include Consumer Cellular and Dish Wireless. In fact, it appears that nearly every Nokia phone announced for the first half of 2022 will only be available through carriers initially (as opposed to unlocked).

The Nokia 2760 Flip 4G will be a TracFone exclusive, coming in the first quarter of the year. Consumer Cellular and TracFone will begin selling the Nokia C100 4G in the first quarter as well. HMD didn't announce any carrier partnerships for the Nokia C200 4G, but you can expect to see it in the spring.

Boost and TracFone will be the first to offer the Nokia G100 4G, while the Nokia G400 5G will be available through most prepaid carriers. Both phones will go on sale this spring.

While the company was excited to announce its new phones and sales strategy, it was short on additional details about the phones themselves. The specifications we've listed above are from a pre-briefing the company held with reporters in December. We'll update this story with additional specs and details as they're released.","{'uri': 'uk.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag UK'}","[{'uri': 'smartphones@uk.pcmag.com', 'name': 'smartphones', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'he_covered_mobile@uk.pcmag.com', 'name': 'He Covered Mobile', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_uk/news/n/nokia-is-d/nokia-is-doubling-down-on-affordable-smartphones-at-ces_8nuz.1200.jpg,0.04313725490196085,eng-7385699,False,0.8588235378265381,0.04313725490196085,379088280,2

Now, one of the biggest Nokia-related announcements for CES 2022 is arguably the unveiling of the 5G-ready Nokia G400. Primarily because that handset comes in at well under $250 but packs 5G support. But HMD Global is bringing far more to the table for those in need of something even more affordable. Including three new 4G Android handsets and an additional ""Originals"" feature phone running the smartphone-like KaiOS.

The new run of handsets includes the Nokia C100, C200, and G100. While the Nokia 2760 Flip brings a traditional flip-phone form factor and KaiOS for apps. All four of the incoming 4G phones come with an MSRP of under $150.

The most different of the devices is, of course, the Nokia 2760 Flip. And that's not just because it's a flip phone. It's also not running Android. Instead running an Android-like but touchless operating system dubbed KaiOS. The remaining handsets all run Android 12 out-of-the-box.

At the most budget-friendly end of the spectrum for CES 2022, aside from the Nokia 2760 Flip, are the Nokia C100 and C200. Both handsets are powered by the MediaTek Helio A22 SoC. And the Nokia C200 is slightly larger at 6.1-inches. However, otherwise, these two handsets are effectively the same. At least, that's as of this announcement, with more details to be unveiled closer to launch. Each comes with 3GB RAM and 32GB of storage with a 4,000mAh battery.

The Nokia G100, conversely, takes the display up to 6.5-inches with an HD+ resolution. That's coupled with a triple-camera set up around the back and an octa-core Qualcomm chipset. Namely, the Snapdragon 615. A power-button-mounted fingerprint sensor is part of the package as well. With a 5,000mAh battery powering the package.

Finally, the Nokia G400 is the company's most affordable, but still somewhat premium 5G handset to date. As of this writing, like the other Nokia CES 2022 announcements, not all of the details about this handset are known. But what Nokia has divulged is that the Nokia G400 comes with a 120Hz refresh rate on the display. And that it comes with a triple-camera led by a 48-megapixel primary snapper. That's coupled with an ultra-wide and macro lens.

In terms of power, the Nokia G400 packs an efficient but powerful Snapdragon 480 5G SoC. And that's coupled with 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage.

For pricing and availability, HMD Global says the Nokia 2760 Flip and C100 will land first, priced at just $79 and $99. Those will arrive in Q1 2022. The Nokia C200, G100, and G500, conversely, will appear in Q2 2022. And pricing for those will be set at $119, $149, and just $239, respectively.","{'uri': 'androidheadlines.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Headlines'}",[],https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nokia-CES-2022-HMD_New2022_Packshot.jpg,0.0117647058823529,eng-7385699,False,0.8392156958580017,0.0117647058823529,379088160,1

Vaughan-Nichols, aka sjvn, has been writing about technology and the business of technology since CP/M-80 was the cutting edge, PC operating system; 300bps was a fast Internet connection; WordStar was the state of the art word processor; and we liked it.

I'm usually not keen on either ARM-powered Chromebooks or dual Chromebooks/tablets. But, the latest Lenovo IdeaPad Duet 5 has me reconsidering.

This hybrid laptop is a 2-in-1 Chromebook and tablet. The lightweight 13.3-inch tablet/display is completely detachable.

Its screen is one of the things I love about this combo. It's an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) Samsung Display, which provides incredible colors, darks, and contrast. I am not a fan of watching videos on screens. That's why I paid serious money for an LG OLED77C1 4K TV . I mean, why would I watch something on a small display when I have a 77-inch TV? But, for the first time, I have a portable screen I'll be happy to watch the next episode of Star Trek Discovery on.

Technically, it has a default resolution of 1920x1080. This is backed up by a Qualcomm Adreno GPU. You can also adjust it to cut down on blue light if you're worried about staying up nights watching a TV show on the display when you should be sleeping.

This is all powered up by an 8-core, 2.55 GHz Qualcomm ARM Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 processor. Inside this, you'll find two fast Kryo 495 Gold cores based on the ARM Cortex-A76 architecture and six small power-efficient Kryo 495 Silver cores built on the ARM Cortex-A55 design. This isn't fast enough to make this laptop much of a gaming machine, but it's more than quick enough for watching 4K videos.

For storage, the Duet 5 uses 128GBs of eMMC Flash Memory. That's more than big enough for a Chromebook. It also has 8GBs of RAM.

When it comes to talking with the rest of the world, it comes with Bluetooth and 802.11ax, better known to me and you as Wi-Fi 6.

Its one lack is that it only comes with a pair of USB-C ports. That's it. The end.

I benchmarked the machine using Principled Technologies' Chromebook-specific, second-generation CrXRPT benchmark using the latest Chrome OS. Principled Technologies, a descendant of Ziff-Davis Benchmark Operations, is one of the best private benchmarking and testing companies on the planet.

This test tells you how fast a Chromebook handles things you do every day. This includes doing work and more fun activities such as playing video games, watching movies, and editing pictures.

The performance test gives you an overall score. With this benchmark, the higher the score, the better. In this case, it scored a decent 61. For ARM-powered Chromebooks, this is a good number. Its battery life came to a healthy 12+ hours.

Altogether, the IdeaPad Duet 5 retails for $499 . As far as I'm concerned, that's a great price for a great machine. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've installed Linux on it, which is now fully supported on Chromebooks, and I'm going to work on getting that set up properly.","{'uri': 'zdnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ZDNet'}","[{'uri': 'steven_vaughan_nichols@zdnet.com', 'name': 'Steven Vaughan-Nichols', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/9d4418970bc685ee42697c224b2af569aac5a7a0/2022/01/04/527dc1ef-22ed-4112-88ae-fe73f03b3d35/lenovo-ideapad-duet-5.jpg?width=770&height=578&fit=crop&auto=webp,0.03529411764705892,,False,0,0.03529411764705892,379087860,2

In the last few weeks, several high-profile companies like Amazon and Google cancelled their participation in the fair in wake of the increased risk from the Omicron variant. However, the organisers of the event persisted and cited that their vaccine and mask requirements while insisting that the show must go on.

""Despite a few well-publicized cancellations amongst our exhibitors, we have over 2,200 exhibitors here at CES 2022 in Las Vegas, and all of them are counting on us to move forward,"" Steve Koenig, a vice president from the group that runs the convention.

The show is being held in a hybrid format, in person but also online, using software developed by Web Summit, a European technology conference. Despite a thinner crowd, the show floor will still hold firms hawking everything from quirky gadgets to technology aimed at humanity's deepest concerns.

One of the top items on the menu for the 2022 edition is transportation, increasingly electric and autonomous. Space-related technologies are making a strong entrance, after a year that saw peaking interest in space tourism and the development of satellite internet.

Meanwhile, Metaverse too was on everyone's mind. The concept refers to the emergence of a world where digital and real worlds are combined, which humans will access via augmented and virtual reality equipment.

Ever since the trade show kickstarted several tech companies came forward to unveil their high-tech gadgets. The CES 2022 became a venue for a host of companies to launch their products and technologies.

Sony announces electric vehicle company

Sony's chairman and president, Kenichiro Yoshida, said that the Group will establish a new company for electric vehicles. He made the comment at the CES technology conference in the United States that was streamed online. He said that it would launch the new company, Sony Mobility Inc., in the spring of 2022, through which it intends to explore entry into the electric vehicle market.

Sony has already announced a prototype vehicle that is being tested on public roads.

Book 14 Go

Consumer electronics brand TCL officially announced its first laptop 'TCL Book 14 Go' offering a Snapdragon 7c chipset and Windows 11 support. The TCL Book 14 Go is priced at $349 and it is expected to be available for purchase in Q2, 2022. At the moment, there are no details on its sale dates in different regions, reports GizmoChina.

In terms of specifications, the TCL Book 14 Go sports a 14.1-inch display with a resolution of 1366 x 268 pixels resolution. The laptop is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c chipset paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. It has a stereo speaker setup and a 720p webcam for video calls and meetings. In terms of portability, the laptop measures 14 mm (0.55"") thick and weighs 1.3 kg (2.87 lbs). TCL says it is the thinnest in its price range.

OMEN 45L desktop and OMEN 16, 17 laptops

HP too announced its newest gaming lineup with the brand new OMEN 45L desktop, refined OMEN 25L desktop, and updated OMEN 16 as well as 17 laptops at the show.

The OMEN 45L desktop comes with a CPU cooling solution dubbed the OMEN Cryo Chamber. This is located up to 43mm above the main tower, and it houses the 360mm AiO liquid cooler that provides CPU temperature 6C lower at full load, according to HP. The desktop features up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU with 24GB GDDR6X memory or an AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT with all-new Infinity Cache technology.

It also comes with a 12th Gen Intel Core i9-1200K processor or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPU and Windows 11. The desktop is expected to be available from January 5 at HP.com and will start at $1,899.99.

'Ryzen 6000' mobile chips by AMD

US-based semiconductor company AMD announced 'Ryzen 6000' series of mobile processors based on next-gen 'Zen3+' architecture.

The AMD Ryzen 6000 series of mobile processors will be based on their updated AMD Zen 3+ Core design and is claimed to hit up to 5 GHz clock speeds which is 1.3x faster in terms of processing when compared to the older Ryzen 5000 series mobile processors.

The top Ryzen 6000 mobile processor will feature 8 Cores (16 threads) and boasts of 11 per cent higher single-threaded performance and 28 per cent higher multi-threaded performance.

12th Gen Core mobile processors

Intel launched the 12th Gen Core mobile processors built on Intel 7 process and carrying two different types of core -- P cores as well as E cores at the grand event. Intel claims that the 12th Gen Intel Core mobile CPUs offer up to 40 per cent faster than their predecessors. They also support DDR5, DDR4, LPDDR4, and LPDDR4x RAM.

The mobile version of the 12th Gen Intel Core CPUs also supports the latest technologies like Thunderbolt 4, and WiFi 6E (Gig+) connectivity. There are three variations of 12th Gen Intel Core mobile processors -- H series and U series.

One of the more ambitious concepts unveiled came in the form of LG's Omnipod (pictured) - which the south Korean firm described as 'a future mobility concept cabin that can reconstruct the customer's space for purpose.'

It's a concept for some sort of mega-advanced caravan essentially. It can be upgraded with modular internal and external features like fridges and retractable furniture - a level of luxury you could probably get close to in a higher end, more traditional motorhome. However the Omnipod ladles on some of the most voguish tech on top.

It comes with a metaverse supporting installation - described as 'an adaptive interior environment that is reconfigured in real time using a moving ""Meta Environment Screen"".' It looks like the idea is the internal space can be transformed to create new environments, like a holodeck.

On top of this there's an AI concierge service - how this goes beyond the current slate of interactive AI systems like Alexa isn't clear yet, other than the presence of a life-sized cartoon avatar.

Of the battery of press releases Qualcomm fired off alongside its presentation, seven were related to connected/autonomous cars and deals with automotive manufacturers. The mobile chip giant has been making some big swings recently in the smart car space, having paid $4.5 billion for automotive tech firm Veoneer in October, and unveiling its Snapdragon Ride autonomous driving solution at CES 2020.

At the show it announced Renault would now begin integrating the Snapdragon Digital Chassis into its cars, while Desay SV and Volvo will both start using the Snapdragon Cockpit Platform to build out upcoming connected car tech. It will also work with Alps Alpine to 'Deliver Next-Generation Automotive Cabin and Cockpit Solutions'. It also unveiled a host of new features such as the Snapdragon Ride Vision System - described as an open, scalable, and modular computer vision software stack.

Sony unveiled an electric car concept called the Vision S - an SUV type prototype vehicle that uses the same EV/cloud platform as the prototype (VISION-S 01), which was unveiled previously and seemed to be primarily about showcasing some imaging and sensing technology it had developed, installed inside and outside the vehicle.

But the key thing here is Sony seems to be properly jumping into the automotive industry now rather than flirting with concepts. It states: ""In order to further accelerate and make new proposals that further evolve the mobility experience, Sony will establish an operating company Sony Mobility Inc in the spring of 2022, through which the company intends to explore entry into the EV market.""

As well as a raft of details on brand new gaming laptops and graphics card variants, Nvidia detailed its new virtual driving assistant developed to work alongside its Drive Chauffeur platform. Called the Nvida Drive Concierge platform, it apparently combines 'speech AI', computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines and simulation system, and creates interactive avatars with ray-traced 3D graphics that you can chat with.

Nvidia said in a statement: ""These important developments in intelligent driving technology, as well as innovations from suppliers, automakers and trucking companies all building on NVIDIA DRIVE, are heralding the arrival of the autonomous era.""

Meanwhile there was plenty of signalling from the traditional automotive firms that they are developing more teched up car offerings. While GM, BMW and Mercedes pulled out of physically attending CES this year, some presentations are still happening virtually, and the noise is all about electric smart cars.

A GM spokesperson told Car and Driver that: ""CES is an important technology platform, and we are continuing with our plans on January 5 to share our significant company news including the reveal of the Chevrolet Silverado EV.""

BMW will later today (8.00pm CET) will make a virtual presentation. On its site it says: ""BMW Group showcases digital innovations from today to the far future, which focus on human-centered digital interactions.

""Highlights include the world premiere of the BMW iX M60 (Combined electricity consumption: 24.7 - 21.7 kWh/100 km* according to WLTP; combined CO2 emissions: 0 g/km), collaborations with world-renowned artists, the first-ever demonstration of a technology that changes a vehicle's exterior colour and the in-car entertainment experience of the future.""

As is the nature of CES, there are hundreds of announcements flying out from any given sector, and there's certainly plenty more connected car kit being unveiled in Las Vegas than we've listed here. Tech firms are moving further into the automotive sector either by collaboration or more on their own steam, and automotive firms are looking to either integrate or develop their own connected systems for new electric vehicles.

This trend is not new - car firms have had a presence at CES at for years. But this year's show would seem to represent the largest splurge of autonomous or connected car activity yet, painting an ever clearer impression of two industries merging.","{'uri': 'telecoms.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Telecoms.com'}",[],https://telecoms.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2022/01/LG-Omnipod.jpg,0.2784313725490195,,False,0,0.2784313725490195,379087620,1

Here's a rundown of what Nokia has just announced, along with market availability and pricing:

While specs are pretty sparse at this point and the full scope of key device info will be made available closer to each individual phone's market release, we know some fundamentals.

The Nokia G400, as mentioned, is the only new 5G-capable Nokia device announced at CES 2022. Powered by a Snapdragon 480 chipset along with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the phone's humble hardware is justified by its ultra-affordable price of $239. And yet, HMD has still outfitted this device with a 120Hz display and a triple camera, consisting of a 48MP wide-angle camera, a ultra-wide camera, and a dedicated macro shooter. You will be able to get the Nokia G400 on Tracfone, Boost Mobile, and Consumer Cellular.

Going down the ladder, we find the $149 Nokia G100, an LTE-only phone that comes with a 6.5-inch HD+ display and is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 615 chipset. There's a capacitive fingerprint scanner in the power button and a triple-camera setup here as well, and on top of that, a 5,000mAh battery will be keeping the lights on. This phone will be available on Tracfone and Boost Mobile.

Finally, we have the Nokia 2760 4G, which is a modern-day reboot of 2007's Nokia 2760 flip phone. The new rendition of the device comes with a familiar old-school resolution of 240 by 320 pixels, a 1,450mAh battery, as well as a memory slot for storage expansion.","{'uri': 'phonearena.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Phone Arena'}","[{'uri': 'peter_kostadinov@phonearena.com', 'name': 'Peter Kostadinov', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://m-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/137579-wide-two_940/Five-affordable-Nokia-devices-announced-by-HMD,0.3411764705882352,eng-7385699,False,0.8627451062202454,0.3411764705882352,379087560,1

At CES on Wednesday, HMD Global (the company that owns Nokia) announced a number of new phones for the budget market and laid out its US sales strategy for the next two years.

The Nokia C100 4G is the company's entry-level smartphone, coming in at just under $100. It sports a Helio A22 chipset, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage.

At $119, the Nokia C200 4G has a lot in common with the C100 4G. It has the same MediaTek A22 chipset and 4GB of RAM, but you get a slightly larger display and double the storage for the extra $20.

If you've become accustomed to Nokia's recent design language, the G100 4G is a notable departure. The $149 phone eschews the round camera module, replacing it with slim vertical camera stack. It features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.

HMD's priciest offering, the Nokia G400 5G, makes 5G accessible at just $239. The G400 5G has the same design as the G100, but sports a beefier Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G chipset, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. It also has a 6.7-inch LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate.

There's even a feature phone in the mix. The $79 Nokia 2760 Flip 4G is made with simplicity in mind. The LTE-enabled flip phone sports dual displays, a large keypad, and other features that make it an attractive choice for children and seniors.

The Nokia 2760 Flip 4G will feature the latest version of KaiOS, while the smartphones will ship with Android 12, though a Nokia representative said none of the upcoming phones will be part of the Android One program. That, along with the fact most of the handsets are being released through prepaid carriers, means there's no guarantee for future OS upgrades and they'll likely be loaded with a fair share of bloatware.

The company said it is pivoting to the budget market for the next two years. It will also expand its current carrier partnerships with T-Mobile and TracFone to include Consumer Cellular and Dish Wireless. In fact, it appears that nearly every Nokia phone announced for the first half of 2022 will only be available through carriers initially (as opposed to unlocked).

The Nokia 2760 Flip 4G will be a TracFone exclusive, coming in the first quarter of the year. Consumer Cellular and TracFone will begin selling the Nokia C100 4G in the first quarter as well. HMD didn't announce any carrier partnerships for the Nokia C200 4G, but you can expect to see it in the spring.

Boost and TracFone will be the first to offer the Nokia G100 4G, while the Nokia G400 5G will be available through most prepaid carriers. Both phones will go on sale this spring.

While the company was excited to announce its new phones and sales strategy, it was short on additional details about the phones themselves. The specifications we've listed above are from a pre-briefing the company held with reporters in December.

A senior DRI official said that based upon an intelligence that cell phone company Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited (Xiaomi India) was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, an investigation was initiated against it and its contract manufacturers.

The DRI official said that during the investigation, searches were conducted at the premises of Xiaomi India, which led to the recovery of incriminating documents.

""The incriminating documents seized from the office of Xiaomi indicated that the company was remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, under contractual obligation. Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments,"" said the DRI official.

On its part, a Xiaomi spokesperson said: ""At Xiaomi India, we give utmost importance to ensuring we comply with all Indian laws. We are currently reviewing the notice in detail. As a responsible company, we will support the authorities with all necessary documentation.""

The DRI official said that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.

The DRI official said that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in India by importing parts and components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India. The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

Evidence gathered during the investigation by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufactures were including the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by it and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, and Customs valuation (determination of value of imported goods) Rules 2007.

In the smartphone space, TCL will launch the first 30 Series devices, the TCL 30XE 5G and 30 V 5G. These smartphones will be joined by the remaining 30 Series lineup later in 2022 and will be solely available in North America.

TCL will also make its first presence in the laptop category with the TCL BOOK 14 Go and enhance its wearable portfolio with the TCL NXTWEAR AIR, the next generation of TCL's portable wearable display glasses.

Additionally, there will be multiple new tablets, including the TCL NXTPAPER 10s with eye protection at its core; the TCL TAB 8 4G and TCL TAB 10L; and a trio of tablets designed for children: TCL TKEE MINI, MID, and MAX. Finally, the company is also introducing the LINKHUB 5G router, along with a portable 4G solution, the LINKZONE LTE Cat4 Mobile Wi-Fi.

TCL 30 Series Smartphones

TCL will launch its first 30 series devices at CES 2022. With the TCL 30 series, customer-favorite technologies such as AMOLED displays and stereo speakers will be matched with impressive connectivity, rich design, and competitive pricing. We look forward to sharing details on additional TCL 30 series smartphones, including the TCL 30 5G, at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next month.

TCL BOOK 14 Go

TCL will also enter the laptop market with its TCL BOOK 14 Go, a Windows 11 designed for students and young professionals entering the working world. Slim, lightweight and with excellent battery life, it is a great fit for anyone who is constantly moving and traveling since it supports LTE connection. Qualcomm-powered 4G LTE connectivity means seamless switching between Wi-Fi and 4G -- no more hunting for WiFi when on-the-go or using the battery-draining mobile hotspot on a phone.

TCL NXTPAPER 10s and Other Tablets

CES 2022 will also see the launch of multiple new TCL tablets, including the TCL NXTPAPER 10s with eye protection at its core. Redesigned to filter out 50 percent more harmful blue light than is required for certification, it also includes anti-glare glass to reduce reflected light and make it more comfortable for swiping, reading, watching, or writing.

Meanwhile, the TCL TAB 8 4G and TCL TAB 10L and a trio of tablets designed for children -- the TCL TKEE MINI, MID, and MAX -- will also be launched.

TCL NXTWEAR AIR

TCL's second generation wearable display glasses are not only 30 percent lighter than their predecessors but also considerably more comfortable. With dual 1080p Micro OLED displays, the TCL NXTWEAR AIR creates an expansive, immersive viewing environment -- the equivalent of watching a 140-inch screen from four metres distance. A 47 pixels-per-degree resolution means it complements that with a similarly cinema-like clarity too, while its dual speakers enables it to playback stereo audio for spatial effects.

LINKHUB 5G Router

TCL is also introducing the LINKHUB 5G router, capable of providing consumers with next-generation connectivity. To bring about TCL's connected vision, it will soon launch the LINKHUB 5G router, while continuing to deliver high-quality 4G solutions with the LINKZONE LTE Cat4 Mobile Wi-Fi, a compact personal mobile hotspot. The LINKHUB 5G router delivers advanced Wi-Fi 6 and support for up to 256 users, making it fully smart home and smart office ready.

5G for all

TCL's vision of 5G for all extends beyond smartphones, with a commitment to improve 5G infrastructure. TCL has invested $1 billion in R&D and established 5G labs. These solutions are created to liberate offices, institutions, homes, work, and entertainment venues, delivering reliable, fast cellular-powered broadband-speed internet connectivity, supporting customers and carriers.

Even while offering pioneering innovations, TCL has always continued to offer a range of accessible pricing options unseen by other tech brands. By operating its own manufacturing and research and development centres around the world, it is able to make its own components and thus controls the production process.

""TCL aspires to be the bridge to high-quality, incredible value solutions for carriers, customers and partners across product categories,"" added Zhang. ""We develop feature-rich volume drivers for carriers that improve the connected experiences of their customers and incredible value offline devices. We pride ourselves in working tirelessly towards a 5G for All world in which everybody can access high-quality data speeds, and we see the bigger picture, creating an ecosystem of products that communicate with one another through multi-screen connectivity.""","{'uri': 'newsbytes.ph', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Newsbytes.PH'}",[],https://newsbytes.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TCL-nxtwear-air.jpg,0.3647058823529412,eng-7382870,False,0.8392156958580017,0.3647058823529412,379087380,1

Amazon, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Apple's refurbished store, and eBay are good places to find lightly used, previous generation phones at a fraction of the cost of a brand-new model.

When buying a used model, many consumers check out the overall condition of the phone, such as whether the screen is cracked, how much charge the battery holds, if there are scratches on the housing, and more. While these are certainly important, there are other factors that are just as important and directly impact whether the phone will work for you.

The bands a phone uses and, to some extent, whether it is CDMA or GSM are important things to check before buying.

In years past, one of the biggest factors you needed to consider was whether a phone was designed to work on a GSM or a CDMA network. While there were many subtle technical differences, at the most basic level GSM and CDMA were simply two different technologies behind wireless networks.

T-Mobile and AT&T both used GSM technology, as did most of the world. There were relatively few companies that used CDMA. Within the US, however, Verizon and Sprint both relied on CDMA.

In many ways, CDMA offered some technological advantages over GSM. Originally CDMA offered better call quality, and often better building penetration. Despite its performance advantages, CDMA was more expensive for carriers and phone manufacturers to work with, thanks to Qualcomm owning most of the intellectual property behind the tech and charging royalties for its use.

In contrast, GSM was far more open, meaning it cost less for companies to use it (via Java T Point). This helped drive its worldwide adoption. With more companies using it and investing in it, GSM caught up with CDMA and eventually surpassed its advantages.

From the user's perspective, GSM phones featured a SIM card, making it an easy matter to switch from one phone to another, whereas CDMA phones traditionally did not have one.

Because these two technologies were incompatible, it was extremely important to make sure you bought the right type of phone in years past. While it's still a good idea to check that even now, it's far less important than it used it be, thanks to 4G and 5G.

With the advent of 4G, carriers the world over moved to a common standard, rather than being divided into GSM and CDMA camps. The newer 5G continues that trend even more. As a result, the only real reason to be concerned with whether a phone is GSM or CDMA is for those rare times when neither 5G nor 4G is available, and a phone must fall back to 3G or 2G technologies, which are still GSM or CDMA (via Verizon).

Even that reason will soon vanish, however, as Verizon has announced it will retire its 3G CDMA network no later than December 31, 2022, and Sprint has been purchased and absorbed by T-Mobile.

A far more important factor when choosing a phone is the bands, or frequencies, of 4G and 5G the phone supports. While 4G and 5G may use standardized, compatible technology, different carriers use different frequency spectrums for their cellular service (via Phone Arena).

For example, one of the main reasons T-Mobile purchased Sprint was to acquire its wealth of 2.5 GHz spectrum, which the company is using for mid-band 5G. Mid-band 5G offers a good blend of speed and range, as opposed to far-reaching low-band, or super-fast high-band.

In contrast, Verizon and AT&T purchased $68 billion worth of spectrum in the 3.7 to 3.98 GHz range to use for their mid-band 5G. Therefore, a phone that has support for 2.5 GHz frequencies, but does not support 3.7 to 3.98 GHz, would be able to take advantage of T-Mobile's mid-band 5G, but not Verizon's or AT&T's.

As a result, when purchasing a phone from a third party, it's critical to make sure the phone supports the same bands, or frequencies, as your carrier. Otherwise, you may have a phone that can only access some of your carrier's network, but not all of it.","{'uri': 'slashgear.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SlashGear'}",[],https://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/verizon-phone.jpg?w=640,0.1764705882352942,,False,0,0.1764705882352942,379087320,1

Laptops powered by AMD hardware are getting an extra level of protection thanks to a new security chip from Microsoft.

First revealed in November 2021, Microsoft Pluton is designed to bring Xbox-level security to Windows PCs, offering physical protections against attacks. As an extension of Microsoft's Trusted Platform Module programme, the hardware needs to be built in, which is why we're only now seeing the benefits.

The rollout has now begun, starting with the new AMD Ryzen 6000 series unveiled at CES 2022.

Microsoft developed Pluton alongside Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm, marking a unified effort to help secure PCs going forward.

""Our vision for the future of Windows PCs is security at the very core, built into the CPU, where hardware and software are tightly integrated in a unified approach designed to eliminate entire vectors of attack,"" Microsoft said.

Security has often proved a weakness for Windows PCs, mostly because of their sheer popularity. Mac and Linux have been protected by having very low levels of market share. But that brings greater responsibility for Microsoft and Pluton is one answer.

While anyone who buys a PC with a Ryzen 6000 inside gets the protection, the first actual laptops come from Lenovo, in the form of the ThinkPad Z13 and Z16. As time goes on, more and more OEMs will include Pluton.

In some ways, the most surprising news is that AMD beat Intel and Qualcomm to the punch with integrating Pluton into a chipset.","{'uri': 'techradar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechRadar'}","[{'uri': 'max_slater_robins@techradar.com', 'name': 'Max Slater-Robins', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQU74yssuF4Znwwn3PCMM6-1200-80.jpeg,0.3960784313725489,eng-7385153,False,0.8392156958580017,0.3960784313725489,379087200,2

Virtuo is simple but elegant in its approach to creating unforgettable sound experiences, foregoing complicated 3D encoding formats in favor of a more straightforward approach that achieves the same end result.

This means that ALPHA is able to provide amazing audio quality without forcing buyers into paying top-dollar for more expensive but relatively similar experiences.

Lastly, Cleer ALPHA comes with Qualcomm cVc (clear voice capture) technology to provide its users with a clear line of communication with users on other devices.

The Cleer+ App

The ALPHA headset is compatible with Cleer's dedicated app, which can be used to control specific device settings to further tailor a user's listening experience.

One of the main advantages of this app is the reduction of the overall physical buttons that users need to press in order to manipulate their headphone settings. With less buttons to fiddle with, Cleer ALPHA has already proven itself to be an innovator in its field.

The app also provides users with a higher degree of customizability in terms of headphone settings, especially when it comes to adjusting how A-ANC works. Through this app, users can fine-tune how much ambient noise gets past the headphones' noise cancellation feature. Of course, settings like volume and sound quality can also be changed through the app as well.

Lastly, the Cleer+ App allows the headset to receive firmware updates, keeping it up to date an all the latest changes.

The Verdict

Cleer outdid themselves with the ALPHA's impressive stack of features and the sheer value of the benefits the headset can provide to users who are looking for a top-shelf wireless audio device.

Chip manufacturer Qualcomm took advantage of the moment and revealed how they want to replace the top dog Intel in the PC world in the future.

The dealer may pay a commission for links on this page, e.g. for those marked with a or green underline.

More information. The chip specialist Qualcomm wants to compete with the top dog Intel for its leadership position in the PC business. Processors that are compatible with Intel technology currently dominate Windows computers. In the case of smartphones and tablets, on the other hand, the architecture of the British chip designer Arm prevailed. After Apple initiated the switch to processors developed in-house based on Arm technology for its Mac computers, Qualcomm now also wants to enter the market for Windows PCs drive that direction. ""The transition to arm technology is inevitable,"" said Qualcomm boss Cristiano Amon on Tuesday at the CES technology fair in Las Vegas.

Windows devices with arm processors have been around for a number of years. So far, however, they have been held back by restrictions in terms of functions. Amon admitted that there were skeptics. But the PCs were changing. Their next generations would be different from current ones. Apple's Mac computers with in-house processors have been praised by experts for speed and power efficiency. Intel countered with a comparative advertising campaign that highlighted limitations compared to the chip company's processors. Apple sees a great advantage in having a uniform chip platform in iPhones, iPad tablets and Mac computers.

At CES, Intel was determined to defend its place in the PC market. The company presented several processors of its new generation of chips for various device classes in Las Vegas. Intel had been slowed down in recent years by problems in the production process for new processors. As a result, smaller rival AMD was able to make up ground. In the PC business, however, unlike Qualcomm, AMD primarily relies on Intel-compatible chips and is therefore not aiming for a radical change.

The processors of numerous Android smartphones come from Qualcomm. The company is also strong in 5G modems for connection to the cellular network and supplies them, among other things, for Apple's iPhones. The chip company wants to play a bigger role in the car business in the future and announced deals with Volvo, Honda and Renault at the CES. Qualcomm also opened a technical development office for Berlin for cooperation with the automotive industry. Qualcomm sees another future market in AR glasses (augmented reality) that can display digital content in real environments. The company will develop a special chip for new Microsoft glasses.","{'uri': 'researchsnipers.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Research Snipers'}","[{'uri': 'sheher_bano@researchsnipers.com', 'name': 'Sheher Bano', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.researchsnipers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qualcomms-challenge-chip-specialist-wants-to-replace-Intel-scaled.jpg,0.1294117647058823,eng-7389973,False,0.6235294342041016,0.1294117647058823,379086420,5

Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it is collaborating with Microsoft on custom processors to manage lightweight augmented reality glasses for usage by consumers and enterprises for metaverse apps.

Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon stated during a press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that the two firms will collaborate to match the specialized processors with the software that developers need to build virtual worlds wherein individuals can work and play.

Future collaboration gadgets, he claimed, will operate with a Microsoft software product called Mesh, which allows users to beam a realistic replica of themselves into the headset of another user, giving the impression that the two are in the same room.

Qualcomm's Snapdragon Locations software will be used in future devices to accomplish basic augmented reality features such as mapping out physical spaces so that digital things may be superimposed on them and hand-tracking so that users can interact with those digital objects with hand motions.

While Microsoft is not attending CES 2022 this year, the company still has announcements coming digitally and through partners at the expo. One of the biggest reveals came from Qualcomm, which is partnering with Microsoft on new custom chips for augmented reality (AR) with a focus on the metaverse.

In a press release to accompany the partnership, Microsoft and Qualcomm describe themselves as ""believers in the metaverse."" Putting aside my own concerns about the metaverse - especially as Meta/Facebook is taking a lead in the tech - there is no doubt tech giants are throwing their weight behind it.

If you are unfamiliar with the Metaverse, it is similar to the OASIS in the movie/novel Ready Player One. A place where users can entertain themselves, shop, consume media, and do just about anything else. It is the virtual reality world science fictions has been discussing for decades.

Facebook believes enough in its Metaverse that it has rebranded its whole operation under the ""Meta"" name. As for Microsoft, CEO Satya Nadella has defended the concept as not a way to snatch reality from users.

Expect just about any virtual reality and augmented hardware and software that releases from now on to be focusing on the Metaverse, whether that was the original intention or not. For example, the new MeganeX VR headset that debuted at CES 2022 this week and claims to be the first metaverse-focused VR hardware.

As for Microsoft and Qualcomm, the companies are promising new AR chipsets that will put emphasis on power efficiency and performance. The duo want to develop chips that are for a new generation of smaller headsets/glasses, much like the MeganeX.

Qualcomm's vice president and general manager of XR, Hugo Swart, says the following about the collaboration:

""This collaboration reflects the next step in both companies' shared commitment to XR and the metaverse. Qualcomm Technologies' core XR strategy has always been delivering the most cutting-edge technology, purpose-built XR chipsets and enabling the ecosystem with our software platforms and hardware reference designs. We are thrilled to work with Microsoft to help expand and scale the adoption of AR hardware and software across the entire industry.""

Microsoft's corporate vice president of Mixed Reality, Rubén Caballero, adds:

""Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation. With services like Microsoft Mesh, we are committed to delivering the safest and most comprehensive set of capabilities to power metaverses that blend the physical and digital worlds, ultimately delivering a shared sense of presence across devices. We look forward to working with Qualcomm Technologies to help the entire ecosystem unlock the promise of the metaverse.""

It is not much of a surprise that Microsoft and Qualcomm are taking an early interest in the metaverse. The most interesting aspect of this announcement is it continues a long-standing partnership between the companies just as Qualcomm's exclusivity for Windows on ARM comes to an end.

Just this week Qualcomm put the blame on the failure of Windows on ARM laptops running the Snapdragon 8cx chipset since 2017 at the foot of OEMs. The company believes manufacturers have been too greedy in selling devices at the $1,000 price point.

Of course, this ignores the fact those devices running Qualcomm chips just did not have the performance or benefits ARM processing is supposed to provide. Both Microsoft and Qualcomm will be hoping for better outcomes from their Metaverse collaboration.

Tip of the day: When Windows 10 or Windows 11 has issues, it's not rare to run into startup problems. Corrupted Windows files, incorrect system configuration, driver failure, or registry tweaks can all cause this issue.

Using Windows startup repair can fix boot issues caused by the most prevalent issues. Though it may seem that all is lost when you run into startup problems, it's important to try a Windows boot repair so you can at least narrow down the source of the issue. If it doesn't work, you may have to reinstall the OS or test your hardware.","{'uri': 'winbuzzer.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'WinBuzzer'}","[{'uri': 'luke_jones@winbuzzer.com', 'name': 'Luke Jones', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://winbuzzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Qualcomm-Flickr-Reuse.jpg,0.0117647058823529,eng-7383810,False,0.7137255072593689,0.0117647058823529,379086300,8

Here, we'll take a look at what makes the Cleer ALPHA tick and why it's as good as it appears on paper.

Cleer ALPHA Notable Features

The Adaptive Active Noise Cancelling (A-ANC) feature is the star of this new headphone design. A-ANC is an interesting bit of technology because, as its name suggests, it is able to dynamically change how much noise cancellation the headphones can provide at any given moment depending on how much noise wearers are experiencing.

This adaptive technology means users will be able to comfortably enjoy their media regardless of where they are. Built-in 40mm ironless drivers help enhance the listening experience by providing clear and pristine audio quality with zero drawbacks. With Bluetooth 5.1 compatibility and 35-hours' worth of playback, ALPHA is perfect for users who are out and about.

Cleer pushes the envelope even further by implementing Dirac's Virtuo audio solution to create ultra-immersive soundscapes. Virtuo is simple but elegant in its approach to creating unforgettable sound experiences, foregoing complicated 3D encoding formats in favor of a more straightforward approach that achieves the same end result.

This means that ALPHA is able to provide amazing audio quality without forcing buyers into paying top-dollar for more expensive but relatively similar experiences.

Lastly, Cleer ALPHA comes with Qualcomm cVc (clear voice capture) technology to provide its users with a clear line of communication with users on other devices.

The Cleer+ App

The ALPHA headset is compatible with Cleer's dedicated app, which can be used to control specific device settings to further tailor a user's listening experience.

One of the main advantages of this app is the reduction of the overall physical buttons that users need to press in order to manipulate their headphone settings. With less buttons to fiddle with, Cleer ALPHA has already proven itself to be an innovator in its field.

The app also provides users with a higher degree of customizability in terms of headphone settings, especially when it comes to adjusting how A-ANC works. Through this app, users can fine-tune how much ambient noise gets past the headphones' noise cancellation feature. Of course, settings like volume and sound quality can also be changed through the app as well.

Lastly, the Cleer+ App allows the headset to receive firmware updates, keeping it up to date an all the latest changes.

The Verdict

Cleer outdid themselves with the ALPHA's impressive stack of features and the sheer value of the benefits the headset can provide to users who are looking for a top-shelf wireless audio device. The unique noise cancellation system and the plethora of Quality-of-Life features has earned the ALPHA headphone our Best of CES 2022 badge.

A senior DRI official said that based upon an intelligence that cell phone company Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited (Xiaomi India) was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, an investigation was initiated against it and its contract manufacturers.

The DRI official said that during the investigation, searches were conducted at the premises of Xiaomi India, which led to the recovery of incriminating documents.

""The incriminating documents seized from the office of Xiaomi indicated that the company was remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, under contractual obligation. Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments,"" said the DRI official.

On its part, a Xiaomi spokesperson said: ""At Xiaomi India, we give utmost importance to ensuring we comply with all Indian laws. We are currently reviewing the notice in detail. As a responsible company, we will support the authorities with all necessary documentation.""

The DRI official said that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.

The DRI official said that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in India by importing parts and components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India. The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

Evidence gathered during the investigation by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufactures were including the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by it and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, and Customs valuation (determination of value of imported goods) Rules 2007.

""By not adding royalty and licence fee into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading Customs duty being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof,"" said the DRI official.","{'uri': 'socialnews.xyz', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Social News XYZ'}",[],https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?id=news/C-1-1428173&txt=DRI+to+recover+Rs+653+cr+from+Xiaomi%2C+3+notices+issued,0.192156862745098,eng-7385274,False,0.9529411792755127,0.192156862745098,379085640,2

Learn more about the latest from Amazon, developers, and device makers.

Each year we look forward to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) as a way to highlight how our teams-including Alexa, Fire TV, Ring, and Amazon Web Services (AWS)-work with fellow device makers, developers, and industry leaders to invent new ways artificial intelligence (AI) can improve lives. Our vision remains squarely focused on ambient intelligence-the kind of technology that understands you and adapts accordingly, is there when you need it, and recedes into the background when you don't.

While we weren't at CES in-person this year, we're still excited to share with you just a few of our favorite announcements, all of which demonstrate the power of this technology both in and outside your home. Take a look and stay tuned for more invention in 2022:

""Alexa, take me to the Moon.""

Together with Lockheed Martin, we have announced plans to send Alexa into space as a part of Artemis I, the first of several NASA missions that will land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon. Alexa will be joining the upcoming mission as a part of Callisto, a technology-demonstration payload embedded into NASA's Orion spacecraft and built in collaboration with engineers from Amazon, Lockheed Martin, and Cisco. Alexa is one of many new, innovative technologies that will be tested as part of Artemis I, and the integration will help those involved explore how voice technology and AI can assist astronauts on future missions.

Alongside Alexa's journey to space, we're developing a series of experiences to make space exploration more accessible to students, teachers, and families who want to follow along with the Artemis I mission. Artemis content and experiences for Alexa will launch closer to the mission, but a preview is available now. To get started and to set up reminders for upcoming mission milestones, just say, ""Alexa, take me to the Moon."" Read more about Alexa's space journey.

A customer-centric, connected experience across millions of vehicles

Together with Stellantis, a leading global automaker and mobility provider, we announced a series of global, multi-year agreements that will transform the in-vehicle experience for millions of Stellantis customers and advance the mobility industry's transition to a sustainable, software-defined future. The collaboration brings together our leadership and innovation in digital experiences, cloud computing, AI, and machine learning with Stellantis' automotive engineering excellence and portfolio of 14 iconic vehicle brands, including Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, and Peugeot.

Here's what our CEO Andy Jassy had to say about it:

""Over the past two decades, Amazon has built the technology, expertise, and culture of innovation to be a world leader in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. We've used these capabilities to make life better for customers around the world through products and services like Alexa, Kindle, and Fire TV, and with AWS we've helped thousands of companies transform themselves and their industries. We're excited to collaborate with Stellantis to transform the automotive industry and re-invent the in-vehicle experience. We are inventing solutions that will help enable Stellantis to accelerate connected and personalized in-vehicle experiences, so that every moment in motion can be smart, safe, and tailored to each occupant. Together, we will create the foundation for Stellantis to transform from a traditional automaker into a global leader in software-driven development and engineering.""

Fire TV is on the move

Fire TV crossed a major milestone of more than 150 million Fire TV devices sold worldwide, and now we're doing even more to deliver amazing entertainment-no matter where you are-by introducing a new Fire TV experience for the car. You'll be able to use Alexa or on-screen touch controls to access more than 1 million TV episodes and movies on Fire TV in-vehicle in the United States, including favorites from Prime Video.

Plus, we're matching the Fire TV experience across devices with personalized settings, so your Fire TV will look the same whether you're looking at the TV in your living room or in your car. You'll also be able to stop playback in your home and resume the show in your car. Fire TV will be available as an option in Jeep Wagoneer, Grand Wagoneer, and Grand Cherokee; Chrysler Pacifica, Ford Expedition, and Lincoln Navigator. Read more on the Fire TV blog.

Ring adds even more functionality to Ring Alarm and Alarm Pro

Ring Alarm has always gone above and beyond to protect your home and give you peace of mind. And with the addition of a variety of sensors such as Flood and Freeze, or Smoke and CO (sold separately), any Ring Alarm and its compatible sensors provide you with an added level of protection.

At CES, we announced a new Ring Alarm Glass Break Sensor, allowing you to further customize your home security system. This new sensor uses AI technology to accurately detect valid glass break events, like windows being smashed or cracked, from up to 25 feet away, and dismisses false alarms like jingling keys or clattering dishes. If sound is detected, you'll receive a notification to your mobile device. You can also update your settings to automatically trigger your Ring Alarm siren when in Home or Away mode, and receive a call from our monitoring center if enrolled in Professional Monitoring with a Ring Protect Pro subscription. Read more at the Ring blog.

Alexa Fund companies showcase personal, accessible tech

The Alexa Fund supports entrepreneurs and startups that are helping shape the future of voice, ambient computing, robotics, and AI. At CES, one Alexa Fund company, Labrador Systems, unveiled its personal robot designed to empower individuals to live more independently by providing practical, physical assistance with everyday activities in the home. You can use an Alexa-enabled device to ask the Labrador Retriever to move large loads through your home or bring items within reach. In addition to Labrador, other Alexa Fund and Alexa Startup companies-including Endel, TalkSocket, Embodied, Asleep, CLMBR, and Mui Labs-also shared their latest inventions.

New Matter support for device makers

We believe your home will include devices from many different companies and brands. You may buy a smart refrigerator from one, a smart lock from another, and a smart light bulb from yet another. It's our job to bring those various devices and services together on your behalf. That's why we are a long-time supporter of major smart home standards and protocols, including Matter. Last year, we announced Matter is coming to most Echo devices and that Echo (4th gen) and eero devices will become Matter Thread border routers. We also committed to bringing Frustration-Free Setup to Matter and ensured that all the functionality a device would need to implement Frustration-Free Setup was in the Matter specification, no custom code or software development kit required.

Now, Frustration-Free Setup documentation is available for device makers to review, and brands such as eWeLink, Ledvance, Sengled, TP-Link, Tuya, and Lifx are working with us to deliver a great set-up experience. We're also working with Philips Hue, Resideo, and others to implement the Commissionable Endpoint capability for Alexa, which lets you add Alexa devices as second administrators for Matter devices so you can take advantage of smart home controls even when your internet connection is down.

We're also collaborating with silicon vendors-including SiLabs, Espressif, Beken, Realtek, Nordic, and TI-to support features such as Frustration-Free Setup. Silicon vendors have begun to develop their Matter offerings, which often include tools and testing environments for developers and device makers. This validation work enables silicon vendors to market a Matter System on a Chip (SoC), which supports Frustration-Free Setup. Read more at the Amazon Developer blog.

Even more choice in voice assistants

In addition to our support for smart home standards and protocols, we want you to be able to choose from a variety of voice assistants on a single device -- because each voice assistant will have its own unique skills and capabilities. That is why in 2019, we launched the Voice Interoperability Initiative, a program that now has more than 90 members working toward this vision, including Facebook, Intel, Qualcomm, Sonos, and Garmin. Voice assistants coexist in devices from brands like Facebook, Samsung, and LG, as well as newly announced devices from SK Telecom and KT. Read more at the Amazon Developer blog.

Originally revealing its future offerings back in 2020. Now we have a proper device in the form of the MeganeX.

At this year's CES, the company has shown off a tiny pair of compact VR goggles designed to work with SteamVR. These VR goggles use MicroOLED technology capable of delivering 2,560x2,560 pixels per eye with a 120Hz refresh rate and 10-bit HDR.

MeganeX promises to be ultra-compact and ultra-lightweight, coming in at just 250g. It's built with Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR1 chipset but isn't designed to be a standalone headset. Instead, the goggles need to be tethered to a gaming PC in order to run.

Plug MeganeX into a PC with a USB able and you'll be able to play SteamVR games and apps without fuss. MeganeX supports 6DoF head tracking and is designed to work with ""almost all"" SteamVR applications. Though no controller has been revealed at this point.

Shiftall, the division of Panasonic responsible for this VR venture, has said it's also working on a ""personal air conditioner"" to go along with the goggles that will heat and cool you so you can experience hot and cold in the metaverse.

Other details are thin at the moment, though Shiftall says MeganeX will sell for ""less than $900"" when it launches in spring 2022.","{'uri': 'pocket-lint.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pocket-lint'}","[{'uri': 'adrian_willings@pocket-lint.com', 'name': 'Adrian Willings', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/1200x630/assets/images/159589-ar-vr-news-panasonic-is-crafting-a-tiny-pair-of-vr-goggles-called-the-meganex-image1-0khyxf9v6y.jpg,0.1450980392156862,eng-7385130,False,0.686274528503418,0.1450980392156862,379085340,1

Recent leaks suggest that the company will announce the Galaxy S22 series early next month, and it will include three devices -- the vanilla Galaxy S22, the Galaxy S22 Plus, and the Galaxy S22 Ultra. Over the last few months, we've learned quite a bit about these devices, including the updated design and a couple of hardware specifications. Now, a new leak has surfaced online, shedding light on the Galaxy S22 Ultra's camera hardware.

The leak in question comes from XEETECHCARE's Zaryab Khan. It confirms that the Galaxy S22 Ultra will feature the same design as the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra with a couple of minor tweaks. In addition, the leak sheds light on the device's camera hardware.

As you can see in the attached image, the Galaxy S22 Ultra will feature a quad-camera setup on the back. It will consist of a 108MP f/1.8 primary camera with OIS, a 10MP f/2.4 3x telephoto camera with OIS, a 10MP f/4.9 10x telephoto camera with OIS, and a 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera. Over on the front, it will pack a 40MP f/2.2 selfie shooter. Additionally, the leak states that the ultra-wide camera on the device will feature a Super Clear Glass lens to help avoid reflections and glare.

Along with the camera hardware, the new leak reveals that the Galaxy S22 Ultra will feature a large 6.8-inch QHD+ display, up to 12GB RAM, up to 512GB storage, and a massive 5,000mAh battery. Furthermore, the leak confirms that it will come with an embedded S Pen. Lastly, the leak states that the Galaxy S22 Ultra will be available in four colorways -- Phantom Black, Phantom White, Green, and Burgundy. While the leak only mentions that the device will feature Samsung's Exynos 2200 chip, we have reason to believe that it will be available with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC in some regions.

A senior DRI official said that based upon an intelligence that cell phone company Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited (Xiaomi India) was evading customs duty by way of undervaluation, an investigation was initiated against it and its contract manufacturers.

The DRI official said that during the investigation, searches were conducted at the premises of Xiaomi India, which led to the recovery of incriminating documents.

""The incriminating documents seized from the office of Xiaomi indicated that the company was remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, under contractual obligation. Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments,"" said the DRI official.

Xiaomi evading customs duty

The DRI official said that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.

DRI official said that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in India by importing parts and components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India. The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

Evidence gathered during the investigation by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufactures were including the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by it and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, and Customs valuation (determination of value of imported goods) Rules 2007.

""By not adding royalty and licence fee into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading Customs duty being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof,"" said the DRI official.","{'uri': 'ibtimes.co.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'International Business Times, India Edition'}",[],https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/666548/xiaomi.jpg,0.1764705882352942,eng-7385274,False,0.9450980424880981,0.1764705882352942,379084800,2

The Korean manufacturer is now sending the update w/ One UI 4 to the Galaxy Note 10 Lite and the Galaxy A72.

Galaxy Note 10 Lite customers in France are currently seeing the update with the firmware version jumping to N770FXXU8FUL7. More regions should follow suit in the coming days. The update comes bundled with the January 2022 security update (via).

Meanwhile, the Android 12 + One UI 4 update for the Galaxy A72 changes the firmware version to A725FXXU4BULA. Customers in Russia are currently seeing this update, but a broader rollout is on the horizon. However, this update carries the December 2021 security patch (via).

If you haven't seen the update notification on your Galaxy Note 10 Lite or the Galaxy A72 yet, head over to Settings - Software update to pull it manually. Both devices will witness multiple changes after the One UI 4 update. Galaxy Note 10 Lite customers can experience improved lock screen and home screen widgets along with a handful of upgrades to the always-on display.

Samsung closed out 2021 by rolling out the One UI 4 update for the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+. Although the initial rollout was far from perfect, the company eventually managed to sort things out. So far, the One UI 4 update has hit almost every Samsung flagship from 2019 and beyond. The Galaxy Tab S7 also received the coveted update not too long ago.

News of Samsung's rapid Android 12 rollout schedule is somewhat taking a back seat since the announcement of the Galaxy S21 FE this week. The Galaxy S21 offshoot was perhaps the worst kept secret in recent memory, with several leaks giving us a pretty decent idea of what to expect months in advance.

We can now say that the Galaxy S21 FE packs a 6.4-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display and the company's One UI 4 (Android 12) out of the box. The phone runs on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chipset, with 6 or 8GB of RAM options. There are a total of two storage variants - 128GB and 256GB. Unsurprisingly, there's no microSD card slot here, so storage expansion isn't an option.","{'uri': 'androidheadlines.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Headlines'}",[],https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/galaxy-note-10-lite.jpg,,eng-7385656,False,0.8392156958580017,,379084680,1

Earlier this morning we posted a report titled ""Ming-Chi Kuo reports on Apple's Mixed Reality Headset Lens Suppliers Genius Electronic Optical and Young Optics."" Our report also linked to a Sony announcement for their next-Gen Mixed Reality Headset for the PlayStation 5 in the works. Now we're learning that Qualcomm announced a collaboration with Microsoft for next-gen lightweight AR Glasses.

During yesterday's Keynote from Qualcomm during the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the company announced their collaboration with Microsoft to expand and accelerate the adoption of augmented reality (AR) in both the consumer and enterprise sectors.

AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm: CES always ushers in a flood of chip news that sets the stage for the year to come, and CES 2022 has been no different.

Two broad themes stand out: a concerted effort by AMD and Nvidia to develop low-end GPUs that (hopefully) will be widely available, and the introduction of next-gen CPU platforms by both AMD and Intel. Here's all of PCWorld's coverage, filed from our homes while CES limped on.

AMD's RX 6000S, RX6850M GPUs

In my mind, one of the most impressive announcements of CES was the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE, precisely because of what it hoped to accomplish: a platform for both work and play. I couldn't help but view AMD's new mobile GPUs through the same lens: GPUs designed for ultraportable laptops that could be carried to work but used for gaming in the evening.

There's a whole slew of mobile GPUs that AMD announced, although the real problem AMD needs to solve isn't one for a spec sheet: We just need to see more AMD Radeon-powered laptops, period.

Meet AMD's Radeon Super Resolution

More and more, the gaming experience is being improved not just by GPU hardware, but the conjunction of hardware and software working together. Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution use image upscaling to turn 1080p frame rates into 4K visual quality, but they require developer support. Enter AMD's Super Resolution, which should work at a more fundamental driver level and accomplish the same thing. Our story explains how it all works.

AMD launches Ryzen 6000 mobile CPUs

Right mouse-click and select open in new tab to see original image. Ryzen 6000 will appear in more than 200 premium laptops this year.

AMD

This is what we were waiting for: AMD's next-gen mobile CPU, which brings hardware ray tracing to the mobile APU. RDNA 2, Zen3+: What's not to like? AMD is bringing some impressive capabilities to bear in the mobile CPU market, and we're extremely eager to see notebooks that take advantage of them. Here's all the details of AMD's new Ryzen 6000 chips.

AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X3D with V-Cache, and what's next for Ryzen

How AMD can push a Ryzen 7 to compete with Intel's Core i9 is a little technical, involving a new chip technology called V-Cache that AMD showed off during CES last year. What it can accomplish, however, looks incredibly impressive, as demonstrated by AMD's benchmarks.

This story has a more serious angle, however: What's next for Ryzen? We'll spoil it for you, slightly: The beloved AM4 socket that AMD has preserved for years is ending, and AM5 is nigh. AMD's Ryzen 7000 is due by the end of the year, and we explain what all of this means for you.

Intel launches Alder Lake 12th-gen mobile CPUs

Intel

The rivalry between AMD and Intel is growing intense, and Intel's long-awaited mobile Alder Lake CPUs set the stage for some epic competition during 2022. Intel's already promising a more than 28 percent performance boost over Tiger Lake, and there's always a flood of Intel-powered notebooks to choose from. Here are the new Alder Lake mobile chips that will help you make that buying decision for new PCs released during 2022 -- i ncluding new P-class chips we haven't seen before.

Intel fills out desktop CPU line with new KS Alder Lake chip, and more

If you look closely at Intel's Alder Lake specs, you can see that Intel has a lot of knobs to turn: clock speed, power, and now the numbers of performance and efficiency cores within Alder Lake, too. How about no efficiency cores? Yep, you'll have that choice. What about a massively powerful 5.5GHZ processor? That option is there, too. Be prepared that when you're picking out a 12th-gen Core tablet or notebook you'll have a bunch of options to choose from, and our story breaks them all down.

Intel begins shipping Arc GPUs

Unfortunately Intel didn't offer much in the way of performance estimates, giving credence to those who think the Arc won't offer that much in terms of graphics power. But the time is ripe to ship a GPU -- any GPU -- to a market starved for graphics of all kinds.

Nvidia launches the GeForce RTX 3050, RTX 3090 Ti, and new laptop GPUs

Nvidia

Does Nvidia know we're knee deep in the midst of The Great GPU Shortage? Apparently not. During its CES 2022 keynote, Team Green came out swinging with not one, not two, but four fresh graphics cards for desktops and laptops. But at $249, the RTX 3050 is an affordable, available (?) GPU, and that's what the market is clamoring for right now. Here are the new Nvidia cards that could power your PC in 2022.

Intel is taking its Evo brand seriously

Intel's never been shy about self-promotion (Intel Inside, anyone?), but, still, the force with which the company is pushing its Evo brand is somewhat surprising. At CES, Intel made two key announcements: First, it's expanding the Evo brand into peripherals, and even some desktops and commercial devices. Second, it's making cross-platform content sharing an Evo perk. Wait, there are perks to buying an Evo laptop? Like, freebies? What's Intel doing here?

Qualcomm, Microsoft team up on AR

This is just vague enough to be tantalizing: Qualcomm and Microsoft are teaming up with chips for lightweight AR glasses. Like Google Glass? A new HoloLens? This bears watching.

Nvidia promises 360Hz 1440p monitors are coming

If you're the type of person who needs a 360Hz 1440p monitor to ensure your League of Legends team brings home the e-sports trophy, then you need to read this story. If you're the type of person who simply can't believe that all this is worth an estimated 3 percent improvement in aiming for ungodly wads of cash, also read this story.

The partnership doesn't come as a surprise with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 chip already powering Microsoft's HoloLens 2 headset since 2019. Qualcomm has in recent years increased focus and development of specialty AR and VR chips, including the Snapdragon XR2 powering the Oculus Quest 2. The San Diego-based company previously worked with the PC maker on bespoke chips such as the customised SQ1 and SQ2 processors for the Surface Pro X.

The support for Snapdragon Spaces XR and Microsoft Mesh platform is notable as both offer interesting mixed reality use cases spanning multiple devices. Mesh already has a cross-platform VR/AR system to connect between virtual reality headsets, smartphones, tablets, and PCs, while Spaces specifically targets integrating Qualcomm-powered smartphones as a ""second screen"" for mixed reality.

Considering Qualcomm specifically highlighted the upcoming collaboration as focusing on ultra-light augmented reality glasses could be an indication that the two have big plans to integrate future projects into a broader and more connected digital world.

AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm: CES always ushers in a flood of chip news that sets the stage for the year to come, and CES 2022 has been no different.

Two broad themes stand out: a concerted effort by AMD and Nvidia to develop low-end GPUs that (hopefully) will be widely available, and the introduction of next-gen CPU platforms by both AMD and Intel. Here's all of PCWorld's coverage, filed from our homes while CES limped on.

AMD's RX 6000S, RX6850M GPUs

In my mind, one of the most impressive announcements of CES was the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE, precisely because of what it hoped to accomplish: a platform for both work and play. I couldn't help but view AMD's new mobile GPUs through the same lens: GPUs designed for ultraportable laptops that could be carried to work but used for gaming in the evening.

There's a whole slew of mobile GPUs that AMD announced, although the real problem AMD needs to solve isn't one for a spec sheet: We just need to see more AMD Radeon-powered laptops, period.

Meet AMD's Radeon Super Resolution

More and more, the gaming experience is being improved not just by GPU hardware, but the conjunction of hardware and software working together. Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution use image upscaling to turn 1080p frame rates into 4K visual quality, but they require developer support. Enter AMD's Super Resolution, which should work at a more fundamental driver level and accomplish the same thing. Our story explains how it all works.

AMD launches Ryzen 6000 mobile CPUs

Right mouse-click and select open in new tab to see original image. Ryzen 6000 will appear in more than 200 premium laptops this year.

AMD

This is what we were waiting for: AMD's next-gen mobile CPU, which brings hardware ray tracing to the mobile APU. RDNA 2, Zen3+: What's not to like? AMD is bringing some impressive capabilities to bear in the mobile CPU market, and we're extremely eager to see notebooks that take advantage of them. Here's all the details of AMD's new Ryzen 6000 chips.

AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X3D with V-Cache, and what's next for Ryzen

How AMD can push a Ryzen 7 to compete with Intel's Core i9 is a little technical, involving a new chip technology called V-Cache that AMD showed off during CES last year. What it can accomplish, however, looks incredibly impressive, as demonstrated by AMD's benchmarks.

This story has a more serious angle, however: What's next for Ryzen? We'll spoil it for you, slightly: The beloved AM4 socket that AMD has preserved for years is ending, and AM5 is nigh. AMD's Ryzen 7000 is due by the end of the year, and we explain what all of this means for you.

Intel launches Alder Lake 12th-gen mobile CPUs

Intel

The rivalry between AMD and Intel is growing intense, and Intel's long-awaited mobile Alder Lake CPUs set the stage for some epic competition during 2022. Intel's already promising a more than 28 percent performance boost over Tiger Lake, and there's always a flood of Intel-powered notebooks to choose from. Here are the new Alder Lake mobile chips that will help you make that buying decision for new PCs released during 2022 -- i ncluding new P-class chips we haven't seen before.

Intel fills out desktop CPU line with new KS Alder Lake chip, and more

If you look closely at Intel's Alder Lake specs, you can see that Intel has a lot of knobs to turn: clock speed, power, and now the numbers of performance and efficiency cores within Alder Lake, too. How about no efficiency cores? Yep, you'll have that choice. What about a massively powerful 5.5GHZ processor? That option is there, too. Be prepared that when you're picking out a 12th-gen Core tablet or notebook you'll have a bunch of options to choose from, and our story breaks them all down.

Intel begins shipping Arc GPUs

Unfortunately Intel didn't offer much in the way of performance estimates, giving credence to those who think the Arc won't offer that much in terms of graphics power. But the time is ripe to ship a GPU -- any GPU -- to a market starved for graphics of all kinds.

Nvidia launches the GeForce RTX 3050, RTX 3090 Ti, and new laptop GPUs

Nvidia

Does Nvidia know we're knee deep in the midst of The Great GPU Shortage? Apparently not. During its CES 2022 keynote, Team Green came out swinging with not one, not two, but four fresh graphics cards for desktops and laptops. But at $249, the RTX 3050 is an affordable, available (?) GPU, and that's what the market is clamoring for right now. Here are the new Nvidia cards that could power your PC in 2022.

Intel is taking its Evo brand seriously

Intel's never been shy about self-promotion (Intel Inside, anyone?), but, still, the force with which the company is pushing its Evo brand is somewhat surprising. At CES, Intel made two key announcements: First, it's expanding the Evo brand into peripherals, and even some desktops and commercial devices. Second, it's making cross-platform content sharing an Evo perk. Wait, there are perks to buying an Evo laptop? Like, freebies? What's Intel doing here?

Qualcomm, Microsoft team up on AR

This is just vague enough to be tantalizing: Qualcomm and Microsoft are teaming up with chips for lightweight AR glasses. Like Google Glass? A new HoloLens? This bears watching.

Nvidia promises 360Hz 1440p monitors are coming

If you're the type of person who needs a 360Hz 1440p monitor to ensure your League of Legends team brings home the e-sports trophy, then you need to read this story. If you're the type of person who simply can't believe that all this is worth an estimated 3 percent improvement in aiming for ungodly wads of cash, also read this story.

A probe by India's Directorate of Revenue Intelligence showed that Xiaomi India's payment of royalty and licence fees to Qualcomm USA and Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, China was not added in the transaction value of imports by the company and its contract manufacturers, the government said in a statement.

""By not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading customs duty being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof,"" the statement said.

Three show cause notices have been issued to Xiaomi for the tax demand and recovery of 6.53 billion rupees for the period April 2017 to June 2020, it added.

""At Xiaomi India, we give utmost importance to ensuring we comply with all Indian laws. We are currently reviewing the notice in detail. As a responsible company, we will support the authorities with all necessary documentation,"" a spokesperson for the company said.

Following the Xiaomi 12 series, Moto X30, and the upcoming OnePlus 10 Pro, iQOO has launched its flagship iQOO 9 series in China today. It includes the iQOO 9 and iQOO 9 Pro, both of which are powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, include a 50MP primary camera, 120W fast-charging, and more.

Starting with the design, the company doesn't seem to have changed much on this front in comparison to its predecessor. You still have an AG glass back but iQOO 9 Pro now includes a huge rectangular camera module that spans along the entire width of the device. You can see the iQOO 9 Pro BMW M Motorsport Edition pictured below.

The iQOO 9 Pro includes a 6.78-inch curved Quad-HD+ E5 AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate support and LTPO technology. The panel also support a 1000Hz touch sampling rate, 1500 nits of peak brightness, and 3200 × 1440p resolution. The front panel also sports a 16MP punch-hole selfie camera and an under-display fingerprint sensor.

Turning our attention to the rear, the triple camera setup on the iQOO 9 Pro packs a 50MP primary Samsung ISOCELL GN5 sensor with gimbal stabilization, a 50MP ultra-wide lens with a 150-degree FOV (similar to the recently launched Realme GT 2 Pro), and a 16MP telephoto camera . You also get the dual-LED flash baked into this camera module. The ultra-wide camera here also supports the FishEye mode, alongside other cool camera features.

Under the hood, we already know that iQOO 9 Pro is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. You also have up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage. For thermal management, the company has included a 3923 sq. meter vapor cooling system on this device. It runs Android 12-based OriginOS Ocean, which was unveiled by Vivo recently. You also get all the essential connectivity options, such as Bluetooth 5.2, Wi-Fi 6, NFC, and more.

Last but not least, the device also includes a 4,700mAh battery unit with 120W wired fast-charging support. Also, you get support for 50W wireless charging on the iQOO 9 Pro, which is great from a convenience standpoint.

The company also launched the vanilla iQOO 9 flagship alongside the Pro variant and it brings some minor downgrades here and there. It boasts the same design as the Pro variant, but you get a flat display on the front instead of a curved one. There's a 6.78-inch Full-HD+ flat E5 AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, 2400 × 1080p resolution, and more.

Another area where the standard iQOO 9 differs from its elder sibling is the rear camera setup. While both variants include the same 50MP ISOCELL GN5 primary sensor, the vanilla model includes a 13MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP tertiary sensor. The 16MP selfie snapper is the same as the Pro variant onboard.

The iQOO 9 also comes equipped with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC, up to 12GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, and the same 4,700mAh battery unit with 120W fast-charging support. You don't have wireless charging on the vanilla variant. So yeah, both the variants here are equally powerful and deliver the same day-to-day user experience.

Starting at CNY 3,999 (around Rs 46,800), the iQOO 9 and iQOO 9 Pro will be available to buy in three RAM+storage configurations. We have listed the price details for all the variants right here:

The iQOO 9 series is currently up for pre-order in China and will be available to buy starting from 12th January. There is currently no word on when the company plans to bring its flagship series to the global market, so stay tuned for more information.","{'uri': 'beebom.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Beebom'}",[],https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/iQOO-9-pro-launched.jpg,0.2313725490196079,eng-7385589,False,0.8117647171020508,0.2313725490196079,379083060,1

So long as your silicon of choice comes from AMD, for the time being at least.

Pluton was first announced in 2020 and is rooted in anti-piracy protection developed for Microsoft's Xbox console some years previously as well as work done for Azure Sphere. The shipping incarnation can be configured three ways, according to Microsoft. As the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), as a security processor for non-TPM scenarios (Microsoft cites platform resiliency) or just turned off by an OEM.

Going beyond TPM, Microsoft suggested scenarios for the tech to provide greater visibility into the state of the platform with signals being reported back to Intune and Azure Attestation Service in the future.

TPM has been a thing for a while (and is infamously one of Windows 11's list of a hardware requirements). It'll perform tasks such as verifying the integrity of the OS but is separate from the CPU design. Popping the root-of-trust directly on the same silicon as the processor means that attack vectors such as sniffing the bus between CPU and TPM are mitigated. The promise of attestation service support in the future will also appeal to administrators tasked with doling out access.

Microsoft has also stated that the Pluton hardware will be updateable through Windows Update and it ""provides a platform for innovation that allows customers to benefit from new features in future releases of Windows that leverage the Pluton hardware."" Assuming, of course, you have a shiny new CPU replete with the tech. Microsoft has, after all, a bit of a reputation these days for abruptly yanking support for older CPUs in the name of security and reliability.

Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD were signed up in 2020, but it is AMD that is first out of the gate with the tech in its Ryzen 6000 series processors, announced at CES yesterday. Similarly, Lenovo unveiled its AMD-powered ThinkPad Z13 and Z16 laptops with the tech (due to ship in May).

AMD will have to share the thunder before long. In December Qualcomm said it would include Pluton via an implementation in the Qualcomm Secure Processing Unit (SPU) for managed systems in the enterprise or education segments. Part of the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 SoC, the first laptops using the chip should turn up during 2022. ®","{'uri': 'theregister.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'theregister.com'}",[],https://regmedia.co.uk/2015/11/09/security_675646345634563456.jpg,0.2392156862745098,eng-7385153,False,0.7607843279838562,0.2392156862745098,379081500,2

AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm: CES always ushers in a flood of chip news that sets the stage for the year to come, and CES 2022 has been no different.

Two broad themes stand out: a concerted effort by AMD and Nvidia to develop low-end GPUs that (hopefully) will be widely available, and the introduction of next-gen CPU platforms by both AMD and Intel. Here's all of PCWorld's coverage, filed from our homes while CES limped on.

AMD's RX 6000S, RX6850M GPUs

In my mind, one of the most impressive announcements of CES was the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE, precisely because of what it hoped to accomplish: a platform for both work and play. I couldn't help but view AMD's new mobile GPUs through the same lens: GPUs designed for ultraportable laptops that could be carried to work but used for gaming in the evening.

There's a whole slew of mobile GPUs that AMD announced, although the real problem AMD needs to solve isn't one for a spec sheet: We just need to see more AMD Radeon-powered laptops, period.

Meet AMD's Radeon Super Resolution

More and more, the gaming experience is being improved not just by GPU hardware, but the conjunction of hardware and software working together. Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution use image upscaling to turn 1080p frame rates into 4K visual quality, but they require developer support. Enter AMD's Super Resolution, which should work at a more fundamental driver level and accomplish the same thing. Our story explains how it all works.

AMD launches Ryzen 6000 mobile CPUs

Right mouse-click and select open in new tab to see original image. Ryzen 6000 will appear in more than 200 premium laptops this year.

AMD

This is what we were waiting for: AMD's next-gen mobile CPU, which brings hardware ray tracing to the mobile APU. RDNA 2, Zen3+: What's not to like? AMD is bringing some impressive capabilities to bear in the mobile CPU market, and we're extremely eager to see notebooks that take advantage of them. Here's all the details of AMD's new Ryzen 6000 chips.

AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X3D with V-Cache, and what's next for Ryzen

How AMD can push a Ryzen 7 to compete with Intel's Core i9 is a little technical, involving a new chip technology called V-Cache that AMD showed off during CES last year. What it can accomplish, however, looks incredibly impressive, as demonstrated by AMD's benchmarks.

This story has a more serious angle, however: What's next for Ryzen? We'll spoil it for you, slightly: The beloved AM4 socket that AMD has preserved for years is ending, and AM5 is nigh. AMD's Ryzen 7000 is due by the end of the year, and we explain what all of this means for you.

Intel launches Alder Lake 12th-gen mobile CPUs

Intel

The rivalry between AMD and Intel is growing intense, and Intel's long-awaited mobile Alder Lake CPUs set the stage for some epic competition during 2022. Intel's already promising a more than 28 percent performance boost over Tiger Lake, and there's always a flood of Intel-powered notebooks to choose from. Here are the new Alder Lake mobile chips that will help you make that buying decision for new PCs released during 2022 -- i ncluding new P-class chips we haven't seen before.

Intel fills out desktop CPU line with new KS Alder Lake chip, and more

If you look closely at Intel's Alder Lake specs, you can see that Intel has a lot of knobs to turn: clock speed, power, and now the numbers of performance and efficiency cores within Alder Lake, too. How about no efficiency cores? Yep, you'll have that choice. What about a massively powerful 5.5GHZ processor? That option is there, too. Be prepared that when you're picking out a 12th-gen Core tablet or notebook you'll have a bunch of options to choose from, and our story breaks them all down.

Intel begins shipping Arc GPUs

Unfortunately Intel didn't offer much in the way of performance estimates, giving credence to those who think the Arc won't offer that much in terms of graphics power. But the time is ripe to ship a GPU -- any GPU -- to a market starved for graphics of all kinds.

Nvidia launches the GeForce RTX 3050, RTX 3090 Ti, and new laptop GPUs

Nvidia

Does Nvidia know we're knee deep in the midst of The Great GPU Shortage? Apparently not. During its CES 2022 keynote, Team Green came out swinging with not one, not two, but four fresh graphics cards for desktops and laptops. But at $249, the RTX 3050 is an affordable, available (?) GPU, and that's what the market is clamoring for right now. Here are the new Nvidia cards that could power your PC in 2022.

Intel is taking its Evo brand seriously

Intel's never been shy about self-promotion (Intel Inside, anyone?), but, still, the force with which the company is pushing its Evo brand is somewhat surprising. At CES, Intel made two key announcements: First, it's expanding the Evo brand into peripherals, and even some desktops and commercial devices. Second, it's making cross-platform content sharing an Evo perk. Wait, there are perks to buying an Evo laptop? Like, freebies? What's Intel doing here?

Qualcomm, Microsoft team up on AR

This is just vague enough to be tantalizing: Qualcomm and Microsoft are teaming up with chips for lightweight AR glasses. Like Google Glass? A new HoloLens? This bears watching.

Nvidia promises 360Hz 1440p monitors are coming

If you're the type of person who needs a 360Hz 1440p monitor to ensure your League of Legends team brings home the e-sports trophy, then you need to read this story. If you're the type of person who simply can't believe that all this is worth an estimated 3 percent improvement in aiming for ungodly wads of cash, also read this story.

A show-cause notice has been slapped on Xiaomi India following recovery of documents during searches on its premises that indicated remittance of royalty and licence fee to US and Chinese firms under contractual obligations, the union finance ministry said on Wednesday. Xiaomi did not immediately offer any comment.

Evidence gathered during investigations by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufacturers were including the amount of royalty paid by the firm in the assessable value of the goods imported by the company and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of the customs law. By not adding ''royalty and licence fee'' in the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading customs duty, being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof, the ministry said. ''After completion of the investigation by the DRI, three show cause notices have been issued to M/s Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited for demand and recovery of duty amounting to Rs. 653 crore for the period April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962,'' the finance ministry said.

During the investigations, it further emerged that the ''royalty and licence fee'' paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co Ltd, China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by the firm and its contract manufacturers. Investigations further showed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of MI brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by the company or assembled in India by importing components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India. The MI brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

The San Diego, California, company once known for its mobile phone chips has created a range of automotive offerings, from self-driving car brains to chips that operate digital dash boards and infotainment systems.

But the chips are all aimed at the same goal of helping carmakers transform their vehicles into rolling computers that can be updated over the air with paid upgrades that generate revenue for carmakers long after a vehicle has left dealer lots.

This business model was pioneered by Tesla.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm said it has reached a deal with Geely Holding-backed brands Volvo and Polestar to use Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon Cockpit"" chips and an operating system from Alphabet's Google in vehicles starting later this year.

The deal will allow Volvo's electric SUV, which is to begin production this year, to tap into hands-free use of Google Assistant and navigation with Google Maps.

The companies said that future upgrades will be sent out over the air.

Qualcomm also said that Honda will start using its ""cockpit"" chips in vehicles that will hit roads in 2023.

The company also said Renault has agreed to use its automotive technology, but did not give specifics of which chips or when vehicles using them would arrive.

TCL announced a new large 8K TV, six Android tablets, laptops, smart glasses, and a new concept foldable phone.

TCL Mini-LED 8K TV

One of the biggest highlights of the showcase was its new large TV, which is the thinnest 85-inch 8K Mini-LED TV. The new 85-inch 8K TV is a prototype at the moment and measures 3.9mm thick. The Mini-LED TV also boasts high contrast from over 2,000 local dimming zones and a super wide colour gamut.

TCL Foldable Smartphone

Another major highlight was TCL's new foldable phone titled ""Project Chicago"". The prototype called ""TCL Flex V"" is still a work in progress and aims to offer an affordable foldable smartphone. TCL is targeting a market price of $600 to $700 for its new foldable phone, which is way below the $1,000 Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3.

TCL's new foldable phone features a clamshell folding design like Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 3. The phone also features an external display for notifications but can also be used as a viewfinder for selfies. The smartphone will be powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC. It will also pack a 3545 mAh battery. The phone opts for a 44 MP front camera and a dual-rear camera setup that consists of a 48 MP primary sensor and a 16 MP secondary shooter.

TCL Book 14 Go

The TCL Book 14 Go is a budget laptop powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7c chipset. It will arrive between April and June in select regions and will cost $350. The chip is paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The Book 14 Go will pack a 40WHr battery that is touted to deliver anywhere between 10 to 12 hours of battery life.","{'uri': 'moneycontrol.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MoneyControl'}",[],https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2022/01/TCL_TV-770x433.jpg,0.2156862745098038,eng-7382870,False,0.6470588445663452,0.2156862745098038,379080720,1

In a rare agreement under even rarer circumstances, both prosecutors and defense attorneys had recommended home confinement rather than time behind bars for Yisroel Goldstein. They cited his leadership in the weeks following the 2019 attack on Chabad of Poway, the immense physical and emotional trauma the former rabbi continues to battle, and his cooperation in the FBI's fraud investigation.

But the judge rejected that punishment as not appropriate given the severity of the crimes.

""You not only committed this offense yourself but you took a lot of people with you,"" U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant told Goldstein, 60.

""I think it's important to send a message to the community, and I think it's important to send a message to you,"" she added.

Goldstein must also pay about $2.8 million in restitution, an amount shared with several other defendants who were prosecuted as participants in the financial cons.

He must self-surrender by Feb. 23, although he could appeal for a later date if COVID-19 continues to surge. The judge agreed to recommend he be housed at a medium-security federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., which his defense attorney said is known to accommodate observant Jews.

As a rabbi in the Chabad movement -- which practices Orthodox Judaism but is also known for its welcoming nature -- Goldstein counted on the generosity of his congregation for his salary. He found other ways to supplement his income.

The FBI says Goldstein had his hand in a number of fraudulent schemes exploiting tax loopholes, corporate benevolence and government grant assistance.

Prosecutors said he personally earned at least $620,000 from the conspiracies.

The most prevalent of the schemes is known as the ""90/10"" fraud. Donors regularly made large charitable contributions to Chabad of Poway or one of its affiliated nonprofits, to be written off their taxes. But instead of the money going to the organizations, Goldstein secretly funneled 90% of it back to the donor, keeping 10% for himself. One donor got his donation returned in the form of $1 million in gold, prosecutors said.

At least a dozen people took Goldstein up on the tax-evasion scheme, resulting in at least $1.5 million in tax losses to the Internal Revenue Service, according to prosecutors.

In one variation on the scheme, donors would solicit their companies for matching charitable contributions. Goldstein would then return all of the original amount to the donor while keeping the corporation's matching funds. The corporations were given fraudulent donation receipts, and many took the tax deductions.

At least three Fortune 500 companies -- Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson and Northrup Grumman -- were defrauded out of nearly $145,000 total.

In deciding the sentence, the judge said she was struck by the number of people whom Goldstein dragged down with him.

""Many of the individuals thought when they were committing their offense to benefit Chabad, the academy or synagogue or the organization in general, when in fact it was really just to benefit you,"" Bashant said. ""It was for your personal benefit and your own greed, and I can't ignore that fact.""

In a letter to the judge and further statements in court, Goldstein expressed deep remorse.

""I beg for mercy to accept my repentance and allow me to right the wrongs and be able to live out the rest of my life with remorse and to be given the chance to do whatever I can to help others to the best of my ability,"" he told the judge Tuesday.

Goldstein, who first launched the synagogue in Rancho Bernardo in the 1980s, was long known as a leader in the local Jewish community. But he became an international figure, delivering a powerful message against hate, when he and three members of his congregation were shot in an antisemitic attack on April 27, 2019. Congregant Lori Gilbert-Kaye, whom he described in court as like a sister, was killed.

The gunman, John T. Earnest, now 22, was recently sentenced to two life terms in prison on both state and federal charges.

Bullets struck the rabbi in both hands, causing him to lose a finger and leaving another severely injured.

Still, in the hours and days after the attack he delivered words of hope -- including an impromptu speech while standing on a chair right after the shooting and appearances at the White House and United Nations.

No one else knew at the time that he was the subject of a fraud investigation that had been open for more than a year.

Goldstein discovered he was being investigated in 2018 when the FBI searched his home and office. He immediately warned one co-conspirator of the investigation but soon after began cooperating with agents.

Goldstein stepped down as rabbi in November 2019, citing exhaustion. News of his crimes wasn't made public until the following summer, when he pleaded guilty to tax and wire fraud.

His misdeeds came to the attention of the FBI as agents were investigating a separate Ponzi scheme run by a San Diego real estate agent, Alexander Avergoon. The rabbi kept popping up in Avergoon's financial entanglements, and soon agents uncovered other long-running frauds.

With help from Avergoon, Goldstein applied for $937,000 in relief and grant money over the years, falsely claiming the funds were needed to upgrade security at the synagogue, repair nonexistent damage caused by 2007 wildfires, implement special programming or upgrade his living quarters.

The funds were awarded by federal and state emergency agencies and a private foundation out of Beverly Hills. The vast majority was pocketed.

Hannah Kaye, daughter of the congregant killed in the shooting, attended the hearing Tuesday with her aunts to bear witness to Goldstein's fate.

""We hold him partially responsible for my mother's murder as a result of him stealing security grants meant to protect the synagogue that were instead used for his own personal gain,"" Kaye said in an interview.

She said she was taken aback by sentimental comments Goldstein made in court about his close relationship with her family.

""I believe that was an exploitive and manipulative tactic used as a way to elevate his victim status,"" she said.

Avergoon also helped Goldstein recruit donors for the ""90/10"" fraud, as well as apply for mortgages and a construction loan on false claims. In turn, Goldstein falsely certified that Avergoon and his associates completed community service hours at Chabad as part of a court order.

Avergoon was sentenced by the same judge Monday to more than five years in prison for the schemes and an unrelated $12-million real estate Ponzi scheme in which investors thought they were buying into rental property.

To prepare for sentencing, Goldstein took the unusual step of producing a documentary-like video to submit to the court to tell his side of the story.

He dates his criminal actions to around 2010, when many of Chabad of Poway's major philanthropists had either moved away or died, and the full weight of the administration of the synagogue and its organizations fell on his shoulders. He said he was triggered by memories of the financial struggles of his boyhood as the ninth of 10 children in Brooklyn, and of the lean early days planting the synagogue in northern San Diego County.

The fraud started small as a salve to the rising anxiety that he was battling about his ability to support himself and his growing family, he said.

""I have fallen prey and worshiped the Golden Calf of money,"" Goldstein wrote to the judge in a letter, referring to an Old Testament idol. ""I have let myself down and everything that I have taught, and everything that I have preached for 40 years, and allowed myself to be seduced to a very dark place, allowing the power of money to get the better part of my soul.""

However, the investigation found that some of Goldstein's schemes date back as early as the 1980s, including a long-running conspiracy to help at least one man shield from taxes more than $2 million in fake donations.

Goldstein is accused of helping his own brother in New York also hide $700,000 in income by depositing money in Chabad bank accounts, with the then-rabbi getting a cut. Mendel Goldstein has pleaded guilty and will be sentenced next month.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/306a5d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3038+0+281/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff2%2Fd5%2Fd02ff2fb4ebf846f3194ac1a137f%2Fsd-photos-1staff-895191-sd-me-rabbi-sentencing-ncc-001.jpg,-0.1686274509803921,eng-7383773,False,0.8666666746139526,-0.1686274509803921,379080660,1

Two broad themes stand out: a concerted effort by AMD and Nvidia to develop low-end GPUs that (hopefully) will be widely available, and the introduction of next-gen CPU platforms by both AMD and Intel. Here's all of PCWorld's coverage, filed from our homes while CES limped on.

In my mind, one of the most impressive announcements of CES was the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE, precisely because of what it hoped to accomplish: a platform for both work and play. I couldn't help but view AMD's new mobile GPUs through the same lens: GPUs designed for ultraportable laptops that could be carried to work but used for gaming in the evening.

There's a whole slew of mobile GPUs that AMD announced, although the real problem AMD needs to solve isn't one for a spec sheet: We just need to see more AMD Radeon-powered laptops, period.

More and more, the gaming experience is being improved not just by GPU hardware, but the conjunction of hardware and software working together. Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution use image upscaling to turn 1080p frame rates into 4K visual quality, but they require developer support. Enter AMD's Super Resolution, which should work at a more fundamental driver level and accomplish the same thing. Our story explains how it all works.

This is what we were waiting for: AMD's next-gen mobile CPU, which brings hardware ray tracing to the mobile APU. RDNA 2, Zen3+: What's not to like? AMD is bringing some impressive capabilities to bear in the mobile CPU market, and we're extremely eager to see notebooks that take advantage of them. Here's all the details of AMD's new Ryzen 6000 chips.

How AMD can push a Ryzen 7 to compete with Intel's Core i9 is a little technical, involving a new chip technology called V-Cache that AMD showed off during CES last year. What it can accomplish, however, looks incredibly impressive, as demonstrated by AMD's benchmarks.

This story has a more serious angle, however: What's next for Ryzen? We'll spoil it for you, slightly: The beloved AM4 socket that AMD has preserved for years is ending, and AM5 is nigh. AMD's Ryzen 7000 is due by the end of the year, and we explain what all of this means for you.

The rivalry between AMD and Intel is growing intense, and Intel's long-awaited mobile Alder Lake CPUs set the stage for some epic competition during 2022. Intel's already promising a more than 28 percent performance boost over Tiger Lake, and there's always a flood of Intel-powered notebooks to choose from. Here are the new Alder Lake mobile chips that will help you make that buying decision for new PCs released during 2022 -- including new ""P""-class chips we haven't seen before.

If you look closely at Intel's ""Alder Lake"" specs, you can see that Intel has a lot of knobs to turn: clock speed, power, and now the numbers of ""performance"" and ""efficiency"" cores within Alder Lake, too. How about no efficiency cores? Yep, you'll have that choice. What about a massively powerful 5.5GHZ processor? That option is there, too. Be prepared that when you're picking out a 12th-gen Core tablet or notebook you'll have a bunch of options to choose from, and our story breaks them all down.

Unfortunately Intel didn't offer much in the way of performance estimates, giving credence to those who think the Arc won't offer that much in terms of graphics power. But the time is ripe to ship a GPU -- any GPU -- to a market starved for graphics of all kinds.

Does Nvidia know we're knee deep in the midst of The Great GPU Shortage? Apparently not. During its CES 2022 keynote, Team Green came out swinging with not one, not two, but four fresh graphics cards for desktops and laptops. But at $249, the RTX 3050 is an affordable, available (?) GPU, and that's what the market is clamoring for right now. Here are the new Nvidia cards that could power your PC in 2022.

Intel's never been shy about self-promotion (""Intel Inside,"" anyone?), but, still, the force with which the company is pushing its Evo brand is somewhat surprising. At CES, Intel made two key announcements: First, it's expanding the Evo brand into peripherals, and even some desktops and commercial devices. Second, it's making cross-platform content sharing an Evo perk. Wait, there are perks to buying an Evo laptop? Like, freebies? What's Intel doing here?

This is just vague enough to be tantalizing: Qualcomm and Microsoft are teaming up with chips for lightweight AR glasses. Like Google Glass? A new HoloLens? This bears watching.

If you're the type of person who needs a 360Hz 1440p monitor to ensure your League of Legends team brings home the e-sports trophy, then you need to read this story. If you're the type of person who simply can't believe that all this is worth an estimated 3 percent improvement in aiming for ungodly wads of cash, also read this story.","{'uri': 'pcworld.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCWorld'}",[],https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ryzen-7000.png?w=1024,0.192156862745098,eng-7384729,False,0.5803921818733215,0.192156862745098,379080600,2

The company is known for mobile handset brant MI, and it has a significant market share. DRI raided initiated an investigation against the company some time back.

According to a statement by the Finance Ministry, evidence gathered during the investigations by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufacturersincluded the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers. This violates of Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 and Customs valuation (determination of the value of imported goods) Rules 2007. By not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading Customs duty being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components,"" the Ministry said.

During the investigation, searches were conducted by the DRI at the premises of Xiaomi India, which led to the recovery of incriminating documents indicating that Xiaomi India was remitting royalty and licence fees to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., under contractual obligation. Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments.

It is called the Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms chipset, and Qualcomm has announced that Volvo and its former sub-brand Polestar will be the first vehicles to use it.

Read: Nvidia launches flagship RTX 3090 Ti and low-end RTX 3050

Volvo has said that the new chipset will beef up its infotainment system, by as much as twice as fast as it currently runs. The new car Snapdragon chips will be able to handle the graphics, audio, and AI needs of the infotainment system with very low power consumption. While it can run on any vehicle, it was purpose built for the boom in electric vehicles we are currently seeing - low power consumption is essential on EVs to extend range.

Volvo also says that it will be able to roll out over-the-air updates that will bring even more improvements to the system in the future. Other brands expected to use the platform very soon include the likes of Honda and Renault.

The chipsets will power the upcoming Polestar 3 first, though. It is expected to launch in 202 and is the EV maker's first fully electric SUV. We aren't completely sure which Volvo EV will be running that platform, however, as the Scandinavian manufacturer hasn't announced any of its electric vehicles expected to launch over the next several years.

Volvo already uses Android Auto, so it is a natural fit. Renault and Honda don't use it yet, so it will be a bigger job to integrate these new Qualcomm chips.

The automotive version of Google's software hasn't seen any major overhauls recently. However, as its popularity increases we should expect the company to put a lot more of emphasis on it. Some EVs releasing this year already run a customised version of the software, like the Hummer EV, so it would behoof Google to put more resources on it.","{'uri': 'bandwidthblog.co.za', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bandwidth Blog'}",[],https://bandwidthblog.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/polestar-3-suv.jpeg,0.01960784313725483,eng-7386745,False,0.7176470756530762,0.01960784313725483,379080540,2

Let the rollout of 5G be your roadmap.

As the S&P 500 continues to hit new highs in 2022, after a 27% rise last year, investors are justifiably questioning where potential upside will come from next. Indeed, prospects for earnings growth are expected to cool considerably compared to the last few years and the Federal Reserve is starting to remove its monetary policy juice while the Omicron variant is resulting in another likely economic headwind.

Amid this backdrop, where are the attractive opportunities?

I've been rather critical of sector-focused investing, preferring instead to focus on structural changes brought about by the evolving landscapes of economics, demographics, psychographics and technology. Through that lens there are a number of attractive growth areas, ranging from cybersecurity and data privacy to precision agriculture and products tied to consumers embracing cleaner living. What gets me excited about these areas are the multi-year opportunities that will likely drive earnings growth not just in 2022 but in 2023 and beyond.

Which multi-year opportunity I am most enthused about? One that will enable a number of new applications, creating a virtuous demand cycle along the way. Indeed, we've positioned the Actions Alerts PLUS portfolio to capture this opportunity and the earnings growth it will drive.

I'm talking about the rollout of 5G.

The rollout of 5G offers attractive growth prospects associated not only with the much-expected smartphone upgrade cycle that will benefit Apple (AAPL) - Get Apple Inc. Report and chip companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM) - Get Qualcomm Inc Report and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) - Get Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Report, but because of the next wave of connective applications the technology will bring with it.

Higher data speeds, greater network capacity and lower latency compared to 4G are expected to spawn the ""industrial internet,"" better known as the Internet of Things, or IoT. According to Mordor Intelligence, IoT was a $761.4 billion market in 2020 and is expected to reach $1.39 trillion by 2026 with the manufacturing, retail, and healthcare sectors fueling adoption.

5G networks are expected to be the communication backbone of IoT as well as enablers of the auto sector moving toward semi-autonomous and eventually autonomous driving. And then there is the metaverse, which will fuel greater network demand and also drive adoption of AR/VR technology, with the same being said for Microsoft's (MSFT) - Get Microsoft Corporation Report Mesh technology, which it touts as revolutionizing the video conference experience.

To be sure, those are big picture outlooks. However, at the heart of it all are networks and chips.

And how do we know how expectations are tracking? Are there any proof points that we as investors should be looking for?

The short answer is ""yes"" and that's something we do constantly at Actions Alerts PLUS along with revisiting the thesis behind our existing portfolio positions even as we assess those for new investment candidates. Confirmation can take a variety of forms, from new products and component capabilities to revolutionary services, all of which tend to leave breadcrumb-like trails that start with company analyst days, quarterly earnings reports and industry trade association events.

That brings us to this week's CES 2022, the annual tech event that historically showcases the coming intersection of technology and products as well as the next round of gadgets that will soon hit shelves. I've been to CES several times, and it's always chock full of information that one can weave into your investment mosaic. I suspect that will once again be the case due in part to a wave of new products to be unveiled from the likes of General Motors (GM) - Get General Motors Company Report, BMW, and Blink Charging (BLNK) - Get Blink Charging Co Report as well as new chip introductions from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - Get Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Report, Nvidia NVDA and Intel (INTC) - Get Intel Corporation Report.

Even though this year's CES will be smaller than originally expected (thank you Omicron), as companies including Amazon (AMZN) - Get Amazon.com, Inc. Report, Meta Platforms (FB) - Get Meta Platforms Inc. Class A Report and Twitter (TWTR) - Get Twitter, Inc. Report have opted not to conduct in-person presentations and meetings, the event's keynote speakers suggest we will hear quite a bit about the aforementioned IoT and connected car. Among those keynotes will be those from representatives of Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Samsung, GM, Abbott Labs (ABT) - Get Abbott Laboratories Report, LG and Sony (SONY) - Get Sony Group Corporation Report.

But a note of caution on CES.

A common investing pitfall is being overwhelmed by data or, in the case of CES, a plethora of announcements and press releases, resulting in ""analysis paralysis."" Simply put, there is so much noise from the event, some people aren't sure where to begin or can't crystalize some of the key takeaways.

When we step back from all of the new product introductions, keynote speeches, marketing videos and press releases, we at Actions Alerts PLUS continue to see vibrant demand for digital infrastructure and connective chips, as well as for the capital equipment companies that make them. In other words, further confirmation for many of our holdings in the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio.

And today with the appearance of the official teaser of the Redmi K50 some of these have been confirmed. Popular tipster Abhishek Yadav shared the teaser on Twitter, alongside the information he has personally confirmed. The teaser mentions Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, whereas Dimensity 9000 seems to be still an option for the Redmi K50, according to Abhishek.

According to the tipster, the Reddmi K50 Series would feature Dimensity 9000 even though the teaser mentions Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. So it looks like a confirmation that there are at least two confirmed variants of the phone. Apart from that, the teaser confirms a 4,700mAh battery with 120W fast charging. The teaser also mentions 'dual VC liquid cooling' hinting towards two vapour chambers that might exist on the phone to provide better a cooling solution.

As of now, the two variants, one with MediaTek's Dimensity 9000 and another one with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 can be confirmed. However, the existence of a third variant can not be ruled out.

A previous report suggested that the Redmi K50 with Dimensity 9000 would come with a 120Hz or 144Hz LTPO OLED display. The report also claimed that the phone would offer an optical under-display fingerprint scanner and a quad rear camera setup.

The Redmi K50 Series may have a 64-megapixel Sony IMX686 or Samsung ISOCELL GW3 as the primary camera sensor, while one of the variants may also feature 108-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL HM2 sensor. Apart from that, nothing much is known about the phones and until all the variants are confirmed, the camera specifications are in a kind of messed up state.

However, we are expecting that more details regarding the Redmi K50 will start emerging soon ahead of the official launch as Xiaomi has already started teasing the phone on social media in China. We're expecting three variants as of now, the base model alongside the K50 Pro 5G, and K50 Pro Plus 5G.","{'uri': 'mysmartprice.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MySmartPrice.com'}","[{'uri': 'jayaditya_chakrabarty@mysmartprice.com', 'name': 'Jayaditya Chakrabarty', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://assets.mspimages.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Redmi-K50-Teaser-05012022.jpg,0.04313725490196085,eng-7385482,False,0.8509804010391235,0.04313725490196085,379080180,1

During the investigation, searches were conducted by the DRI at the premises of Xiaomi India, which led to the recovery of incriminating documents indicating that Xiaomi India was remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., under contractual obligation.

Statements of key persons of Xiaomi India and its contract manufactures were recorded, during which one of the directors of Xiaomi India confirmed the said payments.

During the investigations, it further emerged that the ""royalty and licence fee"" paid by Xiaomi India to Qualcomm USA and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co. Ltd., China (related party of Xiaomi India) were not being added in the transaction value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.

The investigations conducted by the DRI further showed that Xiaomi India is engaged in the sale of Mi brand mobile phones and these mobile phones are either imported by Xiaomi India or assembled in India by importing parts and components of mobile phones by contract manufacturers of Xiaomi India. The Mi brand mobile phones manufactured by the contract manufacturers are sold exclusively to Xiaomi India, in terms of the contract agreement.

Evidence gathered during the investigations by the DRI indicated that neither Xiaomi India nor its contract manufactures were including the amount of royalty paid by Xiaomi India in the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers, which is in violation of Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 and Customs valuation (determination of value of imported goods) Rules 2007.

By not adding ""royalty and licence fee"" into the transaction value, Xiaomi India was evading Customs duty being the beneficial owner of such imported mobile phones, the parts and components thereof.

After completion of the investigation by the DRI, three show cause notices have been issued to Xiaomi India for demand and recovery of duty amounting to ₹653 crore for the period 1st April 2017 to 30th June 2020, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962.","{'uri': 'livemint.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'mint'}",[],https://images.livemint.com/img/2022/01/05/600x338/2021-07-06T015236Z_1_LYNXNPEH6501X_RTROPTP_3_XIAOMI-INDIA_1626662838239_1641380684450.JPG,0.2784313725490195,eng-7385274,False,0.8549019694328308,0.2784313725490195,379079760,2

GM has held the top spot in the U.S. since 1931, according to Automotive News. Forward-looking investors didn't seem too concerned, as the stock changed gear, jumping 7.5% on Tuesday. It could go up another gear as the Detroit auto maker is expected to unveil an all-electric Chevy Silverado Wednesday.

The stock climbed 12% Tuesday to its highest close in more than 20 years. Tesla stock also began the year with a bang, surging 13.5% on Monday after reporting record fourth-quarter deliveries.

As if all that wasn't enough to turn petrol heads, Sony announced plans to explore the commercial launch of electric vehicles at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. The Japanese conglomerate, which also unveiled a new prototype electric SUV, will launch Sony Mobility in the spring, a new company aimed at muscling into the EV space.

It isn't just car makers getting in on the action. Chip maker Qualcomm's CEO, Cristiano Amon, said he sees in cars, in an interview with Barron's, following with Honda, Renault, and Volvo.

***Insurance to Pay for More Expensive At-Home Covid Tests

Insurance companies will be required to reimburse consumers for at-home Covid-19 test kit purchases starting next week. Walmart and Kroger raised the price of a two-test kit by Abbott Laboratories after the end of an agreement with the government to sell them at cost.

Walmart, Kroger, and Amazon.com had a deal to sell Abbott's BinaxNOW tests for $14 but that expired in December reported. Walmart now sells them for $19.98, while Kroger charges $23.99. The U.S. has doubled its purchase of Pfizer's Covid-19 antiviral pills to treat high-risk individuals, to 20 million treatments. President Joe Biden said the first batch of pills went out Christmas Eve, and more will ship this week. The U.S. reported 1,082,549 new coronavirus infections on Monday, including the delayed count from the holiday weekend, according to Johns Hopkins University. The total is more than double the previous record set five days ago. U.S. residents aged 16 and older who received their second dose of the Pfizer- BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine can get a booster shot five months later, rather than six, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The CDC also recommended third doses for immunocompromised children aged five to 11.

What's Next: A CDC vaccine advisory panel will meet Wednesday to consider boosters for 12- to 15-year-olds. The Food and Drug Administration authorized booster doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, but the CDC's approval is needed before they become available.

***Consumer Tech Sales Expected to Slow in 2022

U.S. consumer tech retail sales will slow to 2.8% growth to $505 billion this year, after a 9.6% gain last year, according to the Consumer Technology Association's released ahead of the CES tech trade show opening Wednesday in Las Vegas.

Tech sales soared during the pandemic when people worked and attended classes from home, and more companies increased their digital commerce. The CTA sees software and services growth slowing to 6% in 2022, from 11.4% in 2021. Hardware growth will trickle to 1.8%, down from last year's 9%. Steve Koenig, CTA's vice president for research, noted that the hardware business is being hampered by higher shipping costs and semiconductor shortages, with average lead times for semiconductors stretching to 22 weeks in late 2021, compared with less than 12 weeks in 2020. Electric and autonomous cars, trucks, bikes, and boats headline this year's show, including Deere's autonomous tractor with an attached tillage implement. Julian Sanchez, Deere's director of emerging technologies, told Barron's that tillage is a labor-intensive process to prepare the soil for next year's planting. Deere said its tractor can run ""fully driverless"" around the clock, with six stereo cameras to detect holes, debris, and other obstacles, and could improve productivity by as much as 20%. Deere wants to design its tractor to perform tasks such as planting and spreading herbicides.

What's Next: Koenig said the real solution to the global chip shortage is new manufacturing facilities planned by Intel, Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor and others, which will reduce reliance on chips from East Asia. But those are all still several years away.

The industry made up the biggest decline in job openings in November, dropping to 1.3 million openings from 1.6 million a month earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Tuesday. Overall, job openings dropped to 10.6 million from 11.1 million in October.

About 4.5 million people quit their jobs in November, a record quit rate of 3%. The November Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey doesn't include the effects of the Omicron coronavirus variant, which began spreading in December and comprised an estimated 95.4% of cases by Jan. 1. Daniel Zhao, senior economist at careers website Glassdoor, told MarketWatch the slowdown in job openings is ""a natural response to the pandemic worsening as employers hesitate to go full force on hiring"" until conditions improve. Employers are ""desperate"" to keep their workers. One McDonald's franchisee in Altamont, Ill., northeast of St. Louis, is offering free iPhones to new hires who stay at least six months, with a sign in the window saying: ""Now Hiring. Free iPhone."" Chipotle and Yum! Brands ' Taco Bell are offering cash bonuses, raises and tuition benefits. Leisure and hospitality also raised their average hourly pay by 12.6% year-over-year. Demand for leisure and hospitality workers remains strong, but jobs have declined from a peak of 1.9 million in July 2021, wrote Nick Bunker, director of economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab.

What's Next: On Friday, the Labor Department reports December employment figures, including nonfarm payrolls, labor-force participation rate, and the unemployment rate. Economists will be looking for corroboration that labor demand has cooled.

***KFC to Offer Beyond Meat's Plant-Based Fried Chicken

KFC will fake chicken made by Beyond Meat in its restaurants nationally next Monday, for a limited time until supplies run out, the two companies announced, calling it a ""Kentucky Fried Miracle.""

The Yum! Brands company has been testing plant-based chicken products in its restaurants since 2019, in locations such as Atlanta, Nashville, and Charlotte. It also tested the plant-based fried chicken in Southern California in 2020, selling out in a week. Beyond Meat stock soared 9% on Tuesday after word of the offering. The two companies made an agreement a year ago where Beyond would make meat substitutes for KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut. The two are counting on a number of people choosing to eat more plant-based food in the New Year. Mexican food chain Chipotle unveiled its plant-based chorizo sausage on Monday. Beyond Meat had initial success in grocery stores and then faltered. Its shares are down 50% in the past year, and the company reported disappointing third-quarter results, with a gloomy sales outlook.

What's Next: McDonald's has been testing a plant-based burger called McPlant in eight locations and is expected to expand the rollout this year, possibly by the end of the first quarter, as a limited time offer.

***First Signals Emerge That Inflation Might Near Peak

Data released this week seem to indicate inflation might be nearing its peak in Western economies.

The Institute for Supply Management's , a key U.S. business survey, stood at 58.7 in December, falling short of expectations but showing a continued expansion for U.S. factories. The data also showed that manufacturers' input prices and supplier delivery delays declined month on month. That was ""the biggest monthly drop in the prices paid measure in over a decade, and leaves it at its lowest level since November 2020,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote. The same trend is at work at the global level, with the JPMorgan global manufacturing purchasing managers index also indicating that supply-chain bottlenecks seem to be fading, even though they haven't disappeared. The minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting, to be , will give an idea of how fast and strong the U.S. central bank intends to keep tightening its policy to tame inflation, which it no longer sees as ""transitory.""

What's Next: Prices keep rising, but maybe at a slower pace than in the past few months, prompting France's top central banker to declare that inflation is now ""close to its peak,"" after data showed December inflation stable compared with November.

Dear Quentin,

I grew up thinking we were the perfect family. My parents were married for 60 years, and my siblings have always been very close. My mom passed away a few years ago. For fun, we all took one of those DNA tests and, shockingly, I found out that I was the product of an affair.

While I haven't been able to confirm 100%, I have a good idea of who my biological dad is through some mutual relatives and friends. I do remember him and his family. Here's the kicker, he won't discuss anything with me.

In fact, his first question was, ""What do you want?"" Honestly, I really wanted answers. I can't get them from mom and don't want to break my father's heart. I don't know if he knows or not. He's elderly and not well.

While my father -- the one I've only known to raise me -- is alive, I don't know if I want a relationship with my half siblings or not. It's all very overwhelming. However, my biological father is also elderly and in poor health.

My siblings have counseled me to consider what I may be entitled to as an inheritance as this man is actually very well off, and always has been. Ironically, my parents purchased a home from him and his wife many years ago.

I don't even know what I may be entitled to, whether I want it or not, whether I want any relationships, etc. Can you help guide me on the financial side of this affair?

Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation. With services like Microsoft Mesh, we are committed to delivering the safest and most comprehensive set of capabilities to power metaverses that blend the physical and digital worlds, ultimately delivering a shared sense of presence across devices. We look forward to working with Qualcomm Technologies to help the entire ecosystem unlock the promise of the metaverse.

Continuing the characteristic features of the OPPO A series, A95 empowers users through powerful technology and stylish design, to address young and sophisticated users' needs for smarter everyday communications.

OPPO A95 comes equipped with a large 5000mAh battery and 33W Flash Charge to ensure longer battery life and usage time.

Stylishly finished using the unique OPPO Glow design, the smartphone is not only gorgeous to look at, but comfortable to use and highly durable. It also features an AMOLED FHD+ display with All-day Eye Care to deliver a better viewing experience.

""From work to play, OPPO A95 offers an all-round smartphone experience that allows you to take on each day with confidence,"" said Muthoni Wachira, OPPO Kenya Head of PR.

Powerful hardware for a practical and long-lasting experience

Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 platform, OPPO A95 delivers a smooth and efficient user experience at all times. This is further enhanced by System Booster, a suit of system-level optimizations that ensure the phone runs seamlessly. OPPO A95 also comes with an 8GB RAM+128GB ROM configuration, and RAM Expansion technology, allowing it to convert unused ROM storage into RAM when manually enabled.

OPPO A95 helps solve users' anxiety around battery life and capacity with its large 5000mAh battery and 33W Flash Charge, which can reach a full charge in 72 minutes. With a 5-minute charge, users can enjoy 1.8 hours of YouTube video viewing and 5.7 hours of voice calls. OPPO has also added a series of charging features to A95 that makes charging the device safer and more convenient: Battery Guard helps personalize overnight charging intelligently, tailored to fit personal user habits; Charging Heat Control monitors heat dissipation and controls the phone's temperature while charging to alleviate any charging-related safety concerns; and Super Power Saving Mode and Super Nighttime Standby both maximize that last leg of battery life when it is most needed.

For photos and videos, OPPO A95 features a 48MP Triple-camera Set-up on the back of the device, together with a series of AI-supported features to capture high quality images. These include 15 different image-enhancing filter presets; AI Scene Enhancement, which can intelligently recognize scenes such as food, flowers, sunsets and more, to optimize colors, saturation and brightness; and Night Mode, for taking bright and clear photos with rich details in the evenings or in low lighting settings. With A95's 16MP front camera and OPPO's AI Beautification and Front Night Mode features, it's now much easier to take more defined selfies. For those aiming to capture their own style through video, A95 also is equipped with a series of features such as Steady Video and SLO-MO, helping to save and record every precious moment in life.

Moreover, the entire phone is manufactured to be both dustproof and waterproof, with an IPX4 rating. It has also been tested for durability by being put through a series of rubbing tests against a range of common household materials designed to simulate everyday wear, making sure that it can hold up to just about any challenge that might come its way.

Stunning and comfortable design with guaranteed durability

OPPO A95 is available in two stylish colors: Glowing Rainbow Silver and Glowing Starry Black. Both models feature OPPO's exclusive OPPO Glow design, which gives the back cover of the phone a subtle shimmering appearance, creating a dual matte finish with glittery details. The phone's cover feels ultra-fine and smooth to hold, and it is also fingerprint-resistant, scratch-resistant, wear-resistant, and fire-resistant, helping users to keep the phone spotless and free from wear and tear.

OPPO A95 features a 6.43-inch display with a 90.8% ultra-high screen-to-body ratio and a high 2400×1080 resolution. The display is fitted with All-day AI Eye Care - a series of features comprising AI Smart Backlight and DC Dimming that help ensure a healthier and more comfortable visual experience throughout the day.

Even with the large 5000mAh battery, the phone still comes in at just 7.95 mm thin and weighs only 175g.

Enhanced productivity and entertainment with ColorOS 11.1

ColorOS 11.1 on OPPO A95 provides the foundation for an efficient and convenient user experience, helping to improve everyday productivity for all kinds of tasks. FlexDrop, for example, ensures smooth multi-task among different apps through resized windows. ColorOS 11.1 protects user safety and privacy with several customized features included as standard, such as All-scenarios SOS.

OPPO A95 includes a number of customized features that can help users to get the most out of mobile gaming.

Additionally, features like Game Space, Game Assistant, and Bullet Notifications all contribute to creating a fully-immersive and interruption-free gaming experience.

OnePlus 10 Pro is the most hotly anticipated launch in the coming week. The new flagship smartphone from the house of OnePlus has been in the news for long and is set to mark its debut on January 11. In the buildup to the launch, a lot of information has been revealed on the phone, giving us much to look forward to from the top-notch Android smartphone.

Most recently, some of the specifications of the OnePlus 10 Pro have been shared by OnePlus co-founder Pete Lau. In a new tweet, Lau mentioned some of the highlights of the new OnePlus device. These include the latest Android OS based OxygenOS, an LTPO display as well as the latest Qualcomm flagship processor.

In case that is not enough to excite you, know that the OnePlus 10 Pro will come in a completely refreshed design and a new camera module that will, once again, be powered by Hasselblad. Here, we take a look at all that we expect to see on the OnePlus 10 Pro upon its launch next week.

OnePlus 10 Pro: A new design

Several renders of the OnePlus 10 Pro have floated on the internet over the past month. The company confirmed these in a recent teaser image on the Chinese social media website Weibo. So now, we know that the new OnePlus flagship will look radically different from its predecessor, the OnePlus 9 Pro.

The biggest change can be observed in the device's camera module at the back. Previously a vertical setup with three lenses, OnePlus has now shaped the camera in a horizontal setup with three equal-sized lenses and an LED flash. Two of the lenses are placed on top while a third lens and the LED flash are placed on the bottom. The module neatly extends from the left edge of the back panel, giving the impression of a patch over one side. Hasselblad branding can also be seen on it.

At the front, there is a bezel-less display with a punch-hole cutout for the selfie camera at the top-left of the screen. The display is slightly curved at the edges and aims to provide a seamless viewing experience. There is a USB Type-C port at the chin alongside a speaker set. A power button and the volume rockers can be seen on the right edge of the phone.

OnePlus 10 Pro: Top-notch specifications

It has been confirmed that the OnePlus 10 Pro will come with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, which means that we can expect the best of processing capabilities on the smartphone. Coupled to this will likely be up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and UFS3.1 256GB storage.

As hinted at before, the new tweet by Pete Lau has confirmed that the OnePlus flagship will come with an LTPO 2.0 display with a 120Hz refresh rate. Previous reports have speculated that this Fluid AMOLED display will measure 6.7-inch diagonally and will support QHD+ resolution.

As for optics, the OnePlus 10 Pro will sport a triple-lens camera module, with a 48-megapixel primary sensor, a 50-megapixel secondary lens and an 8-megapixel lens. At the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie shooter.

The phone will run OxygenOS 12 based on Android 12 right out of the box. There are, of course, other notable features on the phone too. These include Bluetooth 5.2, NFC support, dual optical image stabilisation (OIS) and dual stereo speakers.

Lau confirms that the OnePlus 10 Pro will be backed by a 5,000 mAh and will support 80W SuperVOOC fast charging, 50W wireless charging as well as reverse charging.

There are only a few more details left to know about the upcoming OnePlus flagship, and we expect to see them at its China launch now. As for when to expect the phone in India, OnePlus may take some time before it pushes out the OnePlus 10 Pro to India or any other of its international markets. For now, the China launch is scheduled for January 11 and you can stay tuned to India Today Tech to know all about the smartphone once it makes its debut next week.","{'uri': 'indiatoday.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'India Today'}","[{'uri': 'sarthak_dogra@indiatoday.in', 'name': 'Sarthak Dogra', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202201/oneplus-10-pro-rear-green-647x363.jpeg?F5EVfBO7lt5O5b6ZMdaLgdTXC2VJXYr4,0.07450980392156858,eng-7384329,False,0.8745098114013672,0.07450980392156858,379076640,2

Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus teased the specifications of the OnePlus 10 Pro before the official start of this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas today, setting the stage for 2022's first major smartphone launch.

While keeping most information under wraps - including prices and availability - Shenzhen-based OnePlus released several images and a spec sheet that looked promising on paper at the CES media day.

Pete Lau, co-founder and chief executive of OnePlus, further hyped the launch with a cryptic tweet.

Some of the specifications that pop out include a triple-lens camera set-up co-developed with top-tier lens maker Hasselblad, which comes with a 48 megapixel lead sensor, a 120-hertz ""fluid"" Amoled display, a 5,000 milliampere-hour battery, and 80-watt charging and 50W charging capabilities.

Xiaomi released a similar 80W charger in 2020, designed to fully charge a device in under 20 minutes.

The OnePlus 10 Pro - which looks similar to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra - is the company's first device to use the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor.

The processor was announced last month and is expected to be in every high-end smartphone released in 2022. More details are expected at its official launch today.

OnePlus' launch kicks off an interesting year for the smartphone industry. Shipments for 2021 are expected to achieve growth of 5.3 per cent a year to 1.35 billion devices when the final data is in, according to the International Data Corporation.

However, due to a third quarter that missed expectations and the continued component shortages and logistical challenges that may not improve until mid-2022, the IDC lowered its growth forecast for 2021 and 2022 from 7.4 per cent and 3.4 per cent to 5.3 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively. This is expected to recover in 2023 and beyond.

Arguably, the most talked-about unveiling of this year is Apple's next iPhone, which is purported to have a rear camera block that doesn't pop out and a punch-hole front camera snapper.

OnePlus is not among the top five smartphone vendors worldwide but it gained a cult following thanks to high-end specs offered at lower prices, earning the company the nickname ""flagship killer"".

Amid other smartphone brands breaching the $1,000 price point, OnePlus was able to keep its devices under this level - until last year's OnePlus 9 Pro.

Other notable media day unveilings include the Samsung Galaxy S21 Fan Edition, Alienware's Concept Nyx, a server that can stream games at home and the EAH-A800 headphones from Panasonic-owned Technics, which claims to have 50 hours of battery life and ""industry-leading"" active noise cancellation.

The CES, which runs from January 5 to January 9, is the world's biggest consumer electronics show but this year's event has been plagued by withdrawals from some of the industry's biggest names owing to a resurgence in coronavirus cases.

Companies that pulled out of this year's show include Microsoft, Twitter, Alphabet, Intel, BMW, Mercedes, Waymo, T-Mobile, Amazon, General Motors, Meta Platforms and Lenovo.

They have either completely withdrawn and opted to participate online or have reduced their physical presence.

The CES was first held in New York City in 1967. Since then, it has become one of the most critical events for the technology industry, attracting tens of thousands of attendees and serving as a platform to introduce important new products and innovations, including the VCR, the DVD and Microsoft's Xbox gaming console.","{'uri': 'thenationalnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The National'}",[],https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/4cUACFVF2FYH6vQRsmUGNzUYjbk=/1440x810/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thenational/KSDRWJ4VDJAVXJ7OCN7FUGTM4I.jpeg,0.1294117647058823,eng-7384329,False,0.6039215922355652,0.1294117647058823,379075980,1

The S21 FE 5G was launched just ahead of CES 2022. It joins the flagship Galaxy S21 phones and tries to bring some of their key features to a more mainstream segment. Some of these high-end features include a 120Hz high refresh rate display, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chip, 5G connectivity, dual stereo speakers, IP68 water and dust resistance, and wireless charging.

It has three cameras on the back - a 12MP main, a 12MP ultra-wide angle and another 8MP telephoto for 3x optical zoom and up to 30x software-induced ""space"" zoom.

The Galaxy S21 FE 5G starts at $699 (roughly Rs 52,150) in the US.

Microsoft and Qualcomm are set to collaborate to expand and accelerate the adoption of augmented reality (AR) for the metaverse in both the consumer and enterprise sector, including developing custom AR chips.

The companies stated they were believers in the metaverse and intend to work together across several initiatives to drive the ecosystem. This includes developing custom AR chips to enable a new wave of power-efficient, lightweight AR glasses to deliver rich and immersive experiences.

Microsoft and Qualcomm also plan to integrate software like Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform. They hope the collaboration will create transformative experiences for the next generation of head-worn AR devices in the metaverse.

""Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation,"" said Rubén Caballero, corporate vice president of Mixed Reality at Microsoft.

""With services like Microsoft Mesh, we are committed to delivering the safest and most comprehensive set of capabilities to power metaverses that blend the physical and digital worlds, ultimately delivering a shared sense of presence across devices.""

Hugo Swart, vice president and general manager of extended reality (XR) at Qualcomm added that the collaboration reflects the next step in both companies' shared commitment to XR and the metaverse. Swart said Qualcomm's core XR strategy has always been delivering the most cutting-edge technology, purpose-built XR chipsets, and enabling the ecosystem with its software platforms and hardware reference designs.

At the start of November, Microsoft launched Mesh for Microsoft Teams, its pitch for the metaverse. It aims to make remote and hybrid meetings more immersive and is set to roll out in 2022. It is a mixed reality service that allows people in different physical locations to join collaborative and shared holographic environments within Microsoft Teams to allow for chats, virtual meetings, and the sharing of documents and more.

This came after Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's name change and its renewed focus on the metaverse. He said the metaverse would feel like a hybrid of today's online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world to allow people to share immersive experiences, even when you can't be together. The CEO added that it will be a more immersive social media experience, where virtual and augmented reality will take centre stage.","{'uri': 'cloudpro.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Cloud Pro'}",[],https://cdn2.cloudpro.co.uk/sites/cloudprod7/files/2021/12/vr_shutterstock.jpg,0.5450980392156863,eng-7383810,False,0.7686274647712708,0.5450980392156863,379075680,3

Personally, I love the refreshed new OnePlus x Hasselblad camera module,"" Pete Lau, Founder of OnePlus said in a tweet while sharing the first look of the upcoming handset.

The phone will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset and will run on the Android 12 operating system.

As per the 3C certification, the OnePlus 10 Pro with model number NE2210 supports output of 7.3ampere at 11V. It translates to a whopping 80W fast charging speed.

So far the fastest charging supported by the OnePlus devices is 65W. With the 80W fast charging speeds, the OnePlus 10 Pro will become the fastest charging OnePlus device, the report said.

Other than this, the phone was previously touted to come equipped with a 5,000mAh battery. It will be supported by a 50W wireless charging support. The device is likely to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC.

A recent report said that the smartphone is expected to sport a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 2K resolution. The screen will be curved on either side and sport a hole-punch cutout at the top left corner.","{'uri': 'thenewsminute.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The News Minute'}",[],https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/OnePlus10Pro_050122_twitter_1200.jpeg,0.2,eng-7384329,False,0.7686274647712708,0.2,379075020,2

Just when you thought that Microsoft already came up with Windows 11 and there's not much left in its sleeve at the moment, the tech giant surprises everybody.

During CES 2022, Lenovo introduced the world to the first Microsoft Pluton-powered Windows 11 PCs, which is the ThinkPad Z13 and Z16, with AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processors.

Right now, we're about to take a closer look at this new unveiling and find out everything that is to know about it.

First of all, let us tell you that the Microsoft Pluton is a security processor, which was pioneered in Xbox and Azure Sphere, and designed to store sensitive data, such as encryption keys.

All this is securely stashed within the Pluton hardware, which is integrated into the die of a device's CPU and is a lot more difficult for attackers to access, even if they have physical possession of a device.

Many of us were expecting this to happen, as Microsoft announced it would integrate its Pluton security processor into Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm CPUs as an on-die chip to reduce the available attack surface on Windows PCs.

This was announced back in November 2020, and the first models were introduced with the XBOX One and Azure Sphere.

Pluton emulates a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to protect the boot process, encryption keys, and credentials directly on the CPU with the end goal of blocking threat actors from gaining access to such sensitive data.

And wait until you hear about all the highlights that Lenovo included in the description of this new laptop:

Redmond officials state that this step is only the start of the Pluton journey with the Windows ecosystem, so it's safe to say that we can expect great things in the future.

Also, the Redmond tech giant said that customers should look for updates from Microsoft and our partners in the future around the expanded hardware availability of Pluton.

As we saw in numerous leaks over the last few months, Samsung's latest Fan Edition device is a trimmed-down version of its flagship Galaxy S21. It offers quite a few of the same features as the flagship model, including a flagship SoC, a respectable camera setup, a high refresh rate display, and a big battery, at a slightly more affordable price. But is it worth getting over a deeply discounted Galaxy S21? Let's quickly take a look at what Samsung's new affordable flagship has to offer.

Since the Galaxy S21 FE is essentially a more affordable Galaxy S21, we'll start with taking a look at their hardware. Check out the table below for a quick comparison of the new Galaxy S21 FE and the flagship Galaxy S21.

As you can probably tell from looking at the spec table above, the Galaxy S21 FE isn't all that different when compared to the flagship Galaxy S21. It offers pretty much all the features found on the flagship device, including a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip, up to 8GB RAM, up to 256GB onboard storage, and the same connectivity features. However, the two phones aren't exactly the same. In fact, the Galaxy S21 FE does a few things better.

For instance, the device has a larger 6.4-inch FHD+ 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which some people might prefer over the vanilla Galaxy S21's 6.2-inch FHD+ 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED 2X display. It even has a larger 4,500mAh battery that offers the same fast charging capabilities as the flagship model. On top of that, the new phone has an arguably better 32MP selfie shooter. But while the Galaxy S21 FE looks to be better than the regular Galaxy S21 in these three areas, Samsung has cut some corners to keep its price low.

Speaking of cutting corners, the new Galaxy S21 FE doesn't get the same telephoto camera as the flagship model. While you do get a 12MP primary camera and a 12MP ultra-wide camera on the device, you don't get a 64MP telephoto camera. Instead, the device features a more modest 8MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and 30x space zoom.

The Galaxy S21 FE also doesn't get the same ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner as the flagship model, and it opts for a more mainstream optical in-display fingerprint scanner. But that might actually be a good thing because my experience with the ultrasonic fingerprint sensors on other Samsung devices hasn't been all that great. They're a bit too sluggish compared to the optical fingerprint scanners that the company offers on cheaper devices.

Since Samsung hasn't shared the complete RAM, storage, and USB specifications for the Galaxy S21 FE yet, we're not sure if it offers the same hardware as the flagship model. It is possible for Samsung to have opted for slower components on the Fan Edition model to keep its price low, but you'll have to wait for our full review to know if that's the case or not.

All in all, the Galaxy S21 FE packs some impressive hardware at its price point and it has the potential to replicate the Galaxy S20 FE's success. However, since it's hitting the market after a long delay, Samsung might not get the same results as last year.

One good thing about the delay, though, is that the Galaxy S21 FE ships with One UI 4 based on Android 12 out of the box. This means that it will get an additional Android OS upgrade and an extra year of security updates, which slightly increases its chances of attracting buyers. Another thing that we're sure will pique your interest in the Galaxy S21 FE is its price. Check out the section below for more details.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will be available in four colorways -- Black, White, Olive Green, and Lavender -- and it will go on sale starting January 11. Although it offers pretty much all the features that you get with the $800 Galaxy S21, it starts at $699 for the base 6GB + 128GB model. If you're wondering if the Galaxy S21 FE is worth the given price or not, make sure you stay tuned for our full review.","{'uri': 'nationalcybersecurity.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'National Cyber Security'}","[{'uri': 'angela_dennis@nationalcybersecurity.com', 'name': 'Angela Dennis', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://nationalcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-display-on-white-background-wqfjdbnqwe-1024x768.jpg,0.2549019607843137,,True,0,0.2549019607843137,379074900,1

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE was recently launched globally, and that gives us an idea of what to expect in terms of specifications.

There is a 4,500mAh battery that that supports 25W wired fast charging and 15W wireless charging, and Samsung has also thrown in a new camera setup highlighted by a 12MP main sensor with OIS.

Mobile computing, enabling the metaverse and connected vehicles, and wireless fibre were the key themes of Amon's presentation. The executive said Qualcomm had progressed in these areas in the weeks since its 2021 Investor Day, when it outlined the opportunities.

More than 200 enterprise customers including Verizon and T-Mobile US are now testing or deploying Windows on mobile compute devices employing Qualcomm's Snapdragon platform, Amon said. He claimed telecommunications is now the top use case for personal computers and said the migration of PCs to the Arm-based processors enabling mobility is ""inevitable"".

Acer, ASUS, HP and Lenovo are all building computers using Snapdragon to connect to mobile networks, the executive said.

Automotive

Amon also announced alliances with several automakers. Renault Group will collaborate with Qualcomm to create new vehicle architectures; Volvo plans to enhance infotainment systems in electric cars; and Honda plans to use the third generation Snapdragon cockpit platform.

The CEO noted Qualcomm's telematics, infotainment and in-car connectivity businesses now have an order pipeline of more than $13 billion, or more than a third of the company's 2021 revenue.

Metaverse and mmWave

Amon revealed Qualcomm is developing a custom Snapdragon chip for AR and is working to develop compatible, lightweight glasses using Microsoft Mesh mixed reality software and Snapdragon Spaces.

Wireless fibre was a fourth theme Amon highlighted at CES: ""5G, including mmWave, is a universal last mile technology"", he claimed.

Amon shared a statement from AT&T Communications CEO Jeff McElfresh, who said Qualcomm's fixed wireless access (FWA) products are helping the operator use 5G for backhaul and direct broadband access.

Qualcomm's chief stated its small cell 5G RAN chipsets and end user device platforms are enabling FWA for operators.","{'uri': 'mobileworldlive.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Mobile World Live'}",[],https://www.mobileworldlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-5.06.23-PM.png,0.1294117647058823,eng-7389973,False,0.7254902124404907,0.1294117647058823,379071000,5

One of the companies that were quick to jump in the new car tech bandwagon is Volvo. Already on the market with a number of EVs and planning even more for the future, the Swedes got in bed in recent years with a number of ""technology leaders"" to come up with the best solutions for what lies ahead.

The most recent announcement from Volvo on this front is the fact it is now expanding its collaboration with Qualcomm in the hopes of coming up with a ""much faster and more responsive"" Android Automotive-based infotainment system dedicated to its cars.

Taking advantage of the capabilities of Qualcomm's Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms, the company plans to design systems capable of supporting ""highly demanding graphics, audio and artificial intelligence requirements"" in its future cars, first in the upcoming Polestar 3 and a new Volvo SUV.

Apart from the fact it should be at least two times as fast as the limited, current application of Android Automotive, the company did not release additional details on the new capabilities.

As Qualcomm already revealed, Volvo is not the only company using its tech to come up with improved infotainment solutions.

After all, from allowing users to connect and communicate with each other, to running full-fledged businesses, new-age phones can do it all. Now, it goes without saying that no device is a 'one size fits all', and depending on your usage and needs, you might prefer one smartphone over the other. Take Vivo's latest handset, the V23 Pro 5G, for instance, which has been specifically designed with 'online influencers' in mind. In fact, the device ships with a dual front-facing camera, a snazzy colour-changing back, and much more. So, should you pick up the phone to build your online portfolio, or look elsewhere? Well, let's find out in this review.

The Vivo V23 Pro 5G brings a lot of enticing features to the table. Unfortunately, the handset's steep pricing, as well as a wealth of more well-rounded alternatives cast a tall shadow on the smartphone.

Vivo is no stranger to eccentrically-designed phones, but the company has outdone itself with the V23 Pro 5G. From a distance, the device looks the part of a run-of-the-mill Android phone and features a sleek frame that holds the phone's curvy display and swooping back together. That said, up close, you'll notice that the phone's shimmery back starts to change its colour the minute sunlight impacts its surface.

To wit, Vivo has employed Fluorite AG glass in the design of the V23 Pro which reacts to UV rays and transforms the exposed bits of the phone's otherwise golden coloured back to a teal/blue-ish hue. The colour-changing effect is as unique as it is mesmerising and you'll be hard-pressed to find another phone with a similar design trait in the market. Suffice it to say, the V23 Pro 5G brings an innovative spin to a conventional smartphone design, and I for one am all for it.

Now, I'm sure you must have a lot of queries regarding the phone's colour-changing back, so allow me to break down some FAQs below -

1 - Is the colour-changing effect available for the Stardust Black colourway of the V23 Pro as well?

Unfortunately, no. The Stardust Black variant of the phone doesn't ship with a colour-changing back.

2 - Will the effect lose its efficacy down the line?

Per the brand, the effect should last around 18-24 months, by which most users usually switch or upgrade to a newer phone.

3 - Will the effect be visible under a case?

So long as you're using a transparent case, the V23 Pro's back should still change colour under the sun.

4 - How long does the effect last?

The colour-changing effect is temporary and the back of the phone will return to its golden state after five-seven minutes.

Rest assured, the V23 Pro's colour-changing back is a showstopper, and buyers opting for the phone will find plenty of ways to customise it to their will. What's more, the device is extremely lightweight too and tips the scales at just 171 grams. Coupled with its sleek girth of 7.36mm, the V23 Pro's chassis paves the way for a superbly comfortable in-hand grip. I'd also like to add that both, the volume rocker, as well as the power button offer fantastic tactility. Moreover, the phone's plastic frame didn't flex despite applying pressure either. Vivo even managed to keep the phone's camera bump in check, and the squarish module looks quite tasteful. Unfortunately, the device still wobbles when kept on a flat surface, so you win some and you lose some here.

The Vivo V23 Pro ships with an in-display fingerprint sensor, which worked quite well during my testing. The sensor has been positioned rather ergonomically too and I could comfortably reach it with my thumb. The smartphone also ships with facial recognition tech, which worked just as well, so no complaints here either.

As good-looking as the V23 Pro is, the smartphone's design is not without its faults. For one, the device omits a headphone jack and doesn't ship with a dual-speaker setup either. Furthermore, the smartphone's AG glass back is quite slippery and the device tends to slip from pretty much any surface, no matter how minute the angle of the inclination. I should also add that the phone's haptic feedback leaves a lot to be desired. Correspondingly, if you tend to draft long emails and messages on your phone, you might want to look elsewhere.

The Vivo V23 Pro ships with a 6.56-inch, FHD+, curved AMOLED display. The panel offers a refresh rate of 90Hz, which isn't the snappiest even by last year's standards, but is still a notch above devices with a 60Hz screen. Now, if you've never been an advocate for phones with a curved screen, then the V23 Pro isn't really going to change your stance on the subject. To that note, the phone's display, albeit stunning, suffers from poor palm rejection. What's more, the panel ships with a rather chunky notch up top, which takes some time getting used to as well.

Thankfully, the screen offers ample brightness and maxes out at 800 nits, ensuring you can use the phone under the sun without squinting your eyes. Furthermore, the device offers fantastic viewing angles and I didn't notice any erratic backlit bleeding around the display's curved edges either. I'd also like to add that the device does in fact, support HD playback from OTT services like Prime Video. Unfortunately, for some odd reason, I couldn't get the phone to install the Netflix app from the Play Store. I even tried installing an apk from Netflix's official support page but the phone refused to run the app. I've reached out to the company for a comment on the same and will update this review as and when I have any more insights. For now, let's move on and talk about the handset's photography chops.

The Vivo V23 Pro features a triple camera array towards the back, comprising a 108MP Samsung sensor, an 8MP Omnivision UW sensor and a 2MP macro sensor. For selfies, the device gets a 50MP main selfie shooter which is assisted by yet another 8MP lens to snap wide-angle selfies or groupfies.

Now, having used the company's X-series of phones, I had high hopes for the V23 Pro in the camera department too. Unfortunately, shots snapped from the phone's primary sensor leave a bit to be desired. In fact, if you scroll through the gallery attached below, then you'll notice that the images shot during the day exhibit lacklustre detail. The same is evident if you look at the image with the blue generator grid wherein, the tree towards the left-hand side of the frame appears straight out of a watercolour painting. The leaves, in particular, have no texture, and the flower pots towards the bottom right appear mushy too. Thankfully, the sensor's colour science isn't too over the top and the scenes are usually rendered authentically. As for lowlight, the smartphone's main sensor does a passable job of retaining the details in the scene. That said, the photos turn out quite grainy, even with the night mode enabled.

That's not all, as you can even change the style of the emanating flashlight to a warmer or a cooler tone to best suit your needs. You'll also get a multitude of different portrait style modes, including the party portrait style which you can use to spruce up your selfies that much more. The company has even bundled a handy teleprompter mode which should come in clutch for when you have to do brand callouts or talk about the fine points of a project in front of a camera.

Devices backed by MediaTek's Dimensity 9000 SoC are just around the corner, though Vivo has stuck with the tried and tested Dimensity 1200 processor to power its latest contender. To wit, the Dimensity 1200 was among the most VFM SoCs of 2021 and the chipset continues to impress, netting remarkable scores in synthetic benchmarking apps. To give you a better picture, the phone secured 6,57,442 points in Antutu, as well as 553 and 2,506 points in GeekBench's single-core and multi-core tests.

Furthermore, the device handled multitasking briskly too, which can be accredited to its speedy UFS 3.1 storage and LPDDR4x memory that drastically reduced the load times when I was jumping between different apps. That's not all, the smartphone could run graphically demanding titles at competitive settings too. In fact, I could max out the graphics and FPS settings in PUBG: New State. Furthermore, BGMI ran at the HDR graphics and Ultra FPS preset without any hiccups. Now, you will have to tone the settings down to the 'Smooth' preset to hit 60fps in the game. Even so, I didn't notice any drastic frame drops during heated gun battles. That said, much like some other Dimensity 1200 SoC phones, the V23 Pro also heats up under strenuous loads. In fact, the device throttled to around 77 percent of its total performance in our CPU Throttle test, which is among the lowest I've seen thus far.

Software-wise, the V23 Pro ships with the company's FunTouch OS v12 that works on top of Android 12. Over the years, the company has streamlined its user interface and while the custom skin is still riddled with bloatware - I'll admit, the UX feels a lot more welcoming and user-friendly. What's more, the brand has even incorporated a tonne of customisation features and users can sift and choose from a variety of animations for the lock screen, the fingerprint sensor, and more. Unfortunately, the smartphone's default launcher doesn't support third-party icon packs as of yet so you will have to either slap a custom launcher or use the icon packs from the phone's built-in theme store. Other than that, the device also gets some nifty software utilities, including an app locker, a built-in screen, and call recorder as well as support for Always-On display and a dedicated dark mode.

The V23 Pro is fuelled by a 4,300mAh cell which, unfortunately, didn't quite see me through the end of a heavy workday. In fact, I had to plug in the phone around the 6 PM mark, with my usage comprising watching YouTube videos, relaying audio to my Bluetooth earphones, and staying connected with my colleagues and friends by means of a myriad of social media and networking apps. Thankfully, the smartphone ships with a speedy 44W charger that charges the device in a little under an hour (55 minutes, to be precise).

The Vivo V23 Pro starts at Rs 38,990 for the 8GB RAM variant, and buyers eyeing the 12GB model will have to shell out Rs 43,990. For the price, the smartphone brings some innovative features to the table, including a colour-changing back, as well as a capable set of selfie cameras. That said, the smartphone's pricing pits it against more powerful and feature-rich devices backed by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 processor. The iQOO 7 Legend, for instance, retails for around the same price and offers better performance, more capable rear cameras, and much faster wired charging. Consequently, I'd recommend the V23 Pro to ardent selfie enthusiasts. For everyone else, the market is ripe with more well-rounded options.","{'uri': '91mobiles.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': '91mobiles.com'}","[{'uri': 'prateek_pandey@91mobiles.com', 'name': 'Prateek Pandey', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.91-cdn.com/hub/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Vivo-V23-Pro-feat.jpg,,eng-7384841,False,0.6941176652908325,,379070580,1

If you're not sure how to activate it, please refer to this site: https://www.enable-javascript.com/

The biggest U.S. chipmakers, including Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., are starting off 2022 by unveiling products that push further into each other's main territories, signaling they're girding for tough competition as semiconductor demand increases across industries.

Intel, clinging to its title of world's largest chipmaker by revenue, showed off graphics chips aimed at fighting Nvidia and AMD in their area of domination. Nvidia's latest chips are targeted at persuading more laptop owners to choose its highly specialized graphics capabilities, and AMD touted products meant to maintain its market share gains.

Qualcomm, the biggest maker of mobile-phone chips, bolstered its push to win a chunk of the personal-computer market, leveraging its strength in smartphone technology.

The flurry of announcements at the annual CES technology conference, based in Las Vegas but mostly taking place virtually, highlights the shifting competitive landscape for the group of companies whose technology rules the computer and mobile-phone industries. Intel's loss of leadership in chip-manufacturing technology has exposed it to challenges from newly confident rivals in the PC market. The company's response under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is to defend that market and, at the same time, to chase sales in its rivals' strongest businesses.

That fight will likely play out beyond 2022, with most analysts predicting Intel will struggle to boost sales this year, compared with revenue gains forecast for the other companies.

Still, on Tuesday, investors rewarded Intel's aggressive competitive posture. While chip stocks in general lost ground, Intel shares rose as much as 1.4%. Nvidia and AMD, which were among the best-performing stocks of 2021, each fell more than 5%. Qualcomm slid as much as 2.8%.

In an online presentation earlier in the day, Intel announced its 12th generation Core mobile processors, including 28 new models that are as much as 40% faster than their predecessors. Crucially, it also said new Arc graphics chips are being shipped to PC makers, including Acer Inc., Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc., which will use them in upcoming machines aimed at gamers.

The Arc chips are Intel's attempt to cut into the dominance of Nvidia and AMD in high-end graphics. More laptops are using add-in graphics cards to bolster capabilities in gaming and content creation, which are increasingly determining customer preferences. Intel's chips in the past have only offered graphics built into main microprocessors, typically with less power to generate realistic images.

Nvidia countered by unveiling new graphics chips for laptops, aimed at bringing high-end gaming and artificial intelligence capabilities to the thinnest and lightest computers.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics processor will equip notebooks that will be priced starting at $2,499, giving them better capabilities than many previous high-end desktop models, Nvidia said Tuesday in a virtual presentation. Laptop models running on the 3070 Ti chip will start at $1,499.

Nvidia, whose market value is larger than any other chipmaker, is rolling out new products as it works to broaden the reach of its technology into the laptop market. Most thin computers contain what's called integrated graphics, capabilities typically built into central processors from Intel or AMD.

Also as part of CES, AMD CEO Lisa Su showed off new laptop and graphics processors, meant to continue the company's run of stealing market share from Intel. AMD's graphics chips have come closer in performance to Nvidia's, but the larger company still controls the majority of the market for add-in cards for PC gamers that can cost more than $1,000.

And in one of the few remaining in-person appearances at CES, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke about his commitment to bringing smartphone technology-based processors to the PC market. He listed customers such as Microsoft Corp., Acer and Lenovo.

Qualcomm's chief also talked up his push into automotive semiconductors, unveiling chips that will help cars pilot themselves. That move will put him in more direct competition with Intel's Mobileye unit and Nvidia, which is also working to make chips to be the brains of vehicles of the future.","{'uri': 'japantimes.co.jp', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Japan Times'}",[],https://cdn-japantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/np_file_133597-870x489.jpeg,0.1843137254901961,,True,0,0.1843137254901961,379070100,3

Learn more about the event.

Jong-Hee ""JH"" Han, vice chairman and CEO of Samsung Electronics, kicked off the CES 2022 tech trade show in a live in-person event this evening with a call for a ""sustainable world."" And he said the company is designing ""everyday sustainability"" into its products.

""Samsung has made sustainability part of everything we do,"" Han said. ""Our product cycles are geared to minimize the impact to the environment.""

Some of that sounds like a contradiction, as the thousands of companies at CES in Las Vegas are dedicated to making tech products for conspicuous consumption.

But Han said that small changes can make a big difference in carbon footprints, and so Samsung has focused on its sustainable technology journey. Last year, Samsung's carbon emissions for chips were down 700,000 tons last year, he said.

He also said Samsung is including more recycled materials in its products, using 30 times more recycled plastics than it did the year before. The company plans to expand use of recycled materials in all of its products by 2025.

""We are not done,"" he said.

Above: Samsung cut its carbon emissions for its chip production last year by 700 tones.

Inside the box, Samsung is getting rid of styrofoam, box holders, and plastics. Last year, the company introduced a solar cell remote control, which recharges itself from the lights in your home. Samsung is upgrading it this year using wireless signals to help recharge it.

By 2025, the company will make TVs and phones work on near-zero standby power, Han said.

Above: Samsung is taking on e-waste.

And the company is doing something about e-waste. When you line up discarded batteries, you can get a line from Las Vegas to South Korea, he said. Since 2009, Samsung has collected five million tons of e-waste. Last year, it introduced Galaxy for the Planet, a sustainability platform.

Samsung is collaborating with Patagonia, the outdoor company, to eliminate micro-plastic waste that makes its way into nature. They're working on filters that can catch micro-plastic waste in washing machines so the waste stays out of the water.

As for products, Samsung showed off a Freestyle projector that projects anything you want onto walls, or down from a light fixture onto a table. The two-pound device can project a 100-inch image on a wall, and you can send content to it with a Samsung Galaxy phone by tapping it. You can even personalize a wall with a fake window. You can manage content with your voice.

Samsung also unveiled a horizontal or vertical screen called Odyssey Ark, a new kind of gaming screen. It is 55 inches horizontal, and it has a curved design, pulling you into the screen. You control it with a wireless wheel controller.

It has multiview options so you can watch a bunch of things at once. This can make use of the Samsung Gaming Hub, which lets you play cloud games on Samsung smart TVs.

The carbon footprint of CES is definitely lower this year, due to the pandemic.

Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, said before the keynote that after two years of relying on technology, our expectations for relying on it are even higher. CES 2022 is taking place in Las Vegas in person, even though many companies like Intel pulled out at the last minute out of concerns over the Omicron variant of COVID-19.

Many people like me bailed out of the show (I'm watching it all virtually), but there is a smaller and dedicated crowd that showed up, as the keynote room was packed, and Qualcomm's CEO Cristiano Amon noted that his press event room was about 80% full. CES estimated half the attendees would come compared to past years, and that 2,000 or so exhibitors would show up.

Han said we have to all get together and do more to make a more sustainable world.

As well as the previously officially confirmed flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 hardware there is a huge 5,000mAh battery, 80W wired charging and 50W wireless charging (though you'll need a proprietary charging stand for that we're sure). Both are badged under parent company Oppo's terminology for each - SuperVOOC and AirVOOC. No longer is OnePlus coming up with its own name for these (bye bye Warp Charge). Reverse wireless charging is also supported.

As you'd expect (and has been heavily rumoured) there's a triple 48MP, 50MP and 8MP camera setup (dual OIS) with a 32MP front camera. That's all the camera info we have at present, but expect it to be embellished before the phone emerges fully. However, expect there to be a wide, ultrawide and telephoto lens as has been standard with other flagships.

The metaverse is coming and companies are embracing this trend with open arms. The latest company to join the bandwagon is Qualcomm, which in partnership with Microsoft is developing a chip that will bring 'metaverse to people'. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2022, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon announced that the company is working with Microsoft for developing a custom augmented reality (AR) chipset that would control new power-efficient, lightweight AR glasses that can be used by consumers and companies alike for accessing the metaverse.

He also said that the two companies will work on integrating their custom AR chips with the software, which can then be used by developers for creating virtual worlds wherein users can work and play.

Apart from a dedicated AR chip and software platform, Qualcomm and Microsoft are also planning to integrate software like Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform. Also Read - AMD Ryzen 6000 processors launched at CES 2022: First to integrate Microsoft's Pluton security chip

For the uninitiated, Microsoft Mesh is a new mixed reality (MR)-based platform powered by Azure that enables people in different physical locations to join collaborative and shared holographic experiences on many kinds of devices. While introducing the platform at its Ignite conference last year, Microsoft had envisioned Mesh to enable users to express themselves as avatars in shared virtual worlds and with the ability to holoport their avatars arriving later on. Then in November last year, the company rolled out support for Mesh in Microsoft Teams with the idea of enabling users to join meetings as their holographic avatars for a shared virtual experience. Around the same time, Qualcomm had introduced Snapdragon Spaces, a headworn augmented reality (AR) developer kit to enable the creation of immersive experiences.

Now, the two companies are working together to bring their individual expertise for developing a unified chipset and accompanying software that will boost the AR capabilities of devices.

""We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale,"" the Qualcomm CEO said on the occasion.

""Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation,"" added Rubén Caballero, corporate vice president Mixed Reality, Microsoft.

While Qualcomm will be developing the new chip, Microsoft will be helping to make the AR glass compatible with its software. The tech giant will make support for software like Microsoft Mesh - Microsoft's shared mixed-reality (MR) platform and the Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform.

""We're announcing that we're developing a custom augmented reality Snapdragon chip for next-generation, power-efficient, very lightweight AR glasses for the Microsoft ecosystem,"" said Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon.

This is not the first time Qualcomm has partnered with Microsoft to power AR headsets. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 850 chip already powers Microsoft's HoloLens 2 headset that was launched back in 2019. Qualcomm has already set itself as an early leader in the XR space by creating the Snapdragon XR1 and XR2 chips. Now that a custom Snapdragon XR3 chip is in the works, it could be very well used in Microsoft's upcoming HoloLens 3. The move is definitely going to make it easier for consumers to experience the metaverse.

We summarize the most important things you should know to choose the best mobile.

Choosing a new mobile can be a daunting task. Among so many different models, brands and specifications, it is easy to get dizzy and end up choosing the model with a more interesting design or with a more striking function.

Two of the phones that are selling the most lately are the Poco X3 Pro and Xiaomi Redmi 10. They are different but more similar than they may seem. Also, they are priced very similarly.

If you are deciding between two of the most popular mobiles of the moment, undoubtedly the most popular mobile of POCO and one of the terminals with the best value for money of Xiaomi of the moment, we are going to get you out of doubt.

These mobiles are perfect for 99.99% of the world, with a reduced price and similar features. But there is always a better motive than the other. Read on to make the best possible choice and invest your money well.

The screen is always one of the most important features, you will spend countless hours in front of it.

In this case, both have a Full HD resolution, even the front-facing screen ratio is similar, 84% in the POCO and 83% in the Xiaomi Redmi 10.

But the screen of the POCO X3 Pro is bigger, with a total size of 6.67 inches compared to the 6.5 inches of Xiaomi's Redmi 10.

The heart of the mobile is the processor and in this case Xiaomi has opted for one of the cheap models from MediaTek, specifically the Helio G88 processor. Meanwhile, POCO chose Qualcomm's Snapdragon 860.

Both have 8 cores, but in these two cases Qualcomm processors still perform better than MediaTek's, at least in this case.

If you are concerned about performance, in this case POCO X3 Pro has better performance, helped by its 6 GB of RAM.

The battery of both mobiles is practically the same. Yes OK POCO X3 Pro has a 5,160mAh battery and the Redmi 10 is 5,000mAh, for practical purposes the battery is more or less the same.

But the performance of the battery is usually very different depending on elements such as the screen or the processor. In this case, according to the tests, the Poco X3 Pros usually gives more time of use.

You also have to take into account the charging power. In the Redmi 10 it is 18W, while in the POCO X3 Pro it is 33W, so the latter charges faster, although again, the difference is minimal.

Xiaomi and POCO (which is a subsidiary of the former) have chosen practically the same cameras for the two mobiles. While the main cameras are different, they have the same resolution. But the differences are there.

For the POCO X3 Pro you have a 48 megapixel camera from Sony, while the Redmi 10 has a Samsung 50 megapixel camera. They both feature an 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle, a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor.

Both can record video in 4K, but the POCO X3 Pro is the mobile that differs with the ability to record video in super slow motion, at 960 fps.

In both cases you can expect good image quality in your photos and videos.

All mobiles, even those that look identical, have slight differences. In this case, both the POCO X3 Pro and the Xiaomi Redmi 10 have details that can make you choose one or the other.

For example, POCO X3 Pro has NFC to make cardless payments with Google Pay or your bank's app. In addition, the storage is faster. It even has space for a second SIM card or microSD card, while Redmi 10 only accepts a microSD card.

Both have a fingerprint reader on the side, which is a detail to take into account.

Between both mobiles, seeing their prices and characteristics, we recommend you get a POCO X3 Pro.

Both phones have very good reviews and opinions among their buyers, but details such as the NFC, the processor and the general performance make POCO's flagship mobile the best option at this time.

You can get a POCO X3 Pro for only 245 euros with 128 GB of storage. Meanwhile, the Xiaomi Redmi 10 costs 182 euros. the price difference is relatively low, but paying a little more you have a mobile that will be better for you in the long run.","{'uri': 'bullfrag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bullfrag'}",[],https://cdn.computerhoy.com/sites/navi.axelspringer.es/public/styles/1200/public/media/image/2022/01/poco-x3-pro-vs-xiaomi-remdi-10-2577329.jpg?itok=tgmdOAf-,0.3568627450980393,,False,0,0.3568627450980393,379065420,2

This is notably the second wave of Alder Lake chips - first for mobile - that's following hot on the heels of the excellent but limited desktop processors (there were only six of those), launched in late October last year to debut the new chips. It's safe to say that Intel will be hoping to keep the momentum going onto the mobile side as well.

At the helm of mobile will be the Core i9-12900HK model which Intel says is the ""fastest mobile processor ever created."" The mighty H-series will be joined by the usual U-series (for thin and light form factors) and another freshly minted 28W P-series that Intel will target specifically towards performance-oriented thin-and-light laptops. The laptop chips are being joined by the rest of the Alder Lake desktop line-up (that's 22 chips in all), that span across Core i9 to Pentium and Celeron.

Alder Lake marks the beginning of an all-new era for Intel. You can also call it its redemption song. Instead of chasing raw power, like before, Intel is offering a mix of performance (codenamed Golden Cove) and efficiency (Gracemont) x86 cores in Alder Lake. Those keeping track would be familiar with the concept - it's pretty similar Arm's big.LITTLE and DynamicIQ technologies employed by Qualcomm and Apple. Intel has combined its Core and Atom architectures, bringing them together on a single die to help achieve what's being billed a balance of power and efficiency.

Alder Lake is based on Intel's 7 manufacturing process - previously known as Intel's third-gen 10nm process, or Enhanced Superfin - which marks a big transition from the ageing 14nm process that the chipmaker has been using since 2015.

The top-of-the-line Core i9-12900HK will offer a total of 14 cores (six P-cores and eight E-cores) and 20 threads. It can top 5GHz using Intel's Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology. Intel is claiming up to 28 percent faster gaming performance compared to Core i9-11980HK. The new chip is also said to be 43 percent faster in 3D rendering gen-over-gen.

Alder Lake is expectedly bringing a lot of future-proofing and support for more advanced standards including support for Wi-Fi 6E, Thunderbolt 4, and DDR5 memory at up to 4800MT/s. Driving the whole hybrid approach will be Intel's Thread Director software.

Qualcomm is now working with Microsoft on custom processors, designed for lightweight gadgets like AR glasses. More importantly, the new chips are designed for both businesses and consumers to work on apps in the metaverse.

""We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale,"" said Qualcomm chief executive, Cristiano Amon at the CES 2022 event in Las Vegas. The press conference announced the new partnership between the two companies to develop custom chips.

The deal will also include software for developers to create apps in the virtual world. The apps are aimed at both professional and causal worlds, where people can work and play in the metaverse using AR glasses. Speaking of the software, Amon said Qualcomm is working with a Microsoft software product called Mesh.

Going into the details, he explained Microsoft Mesh is vital for realistic AR experiences. Mesh allows users to beam a realistic appearance of themselves into the headset of another user. This further allows them both to experience as if they're in the same room, sharing the same experiences.

""Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation,"" Rubén Caballero, corporate vice president for mixed reality at Microsoft, said in a statement.

AR and the metaverse are going to be the future and Qualcomm is tapping into it already. Qualcomm also announced the Snapdragon Specs, which is a software that future hardware developers can tap into. Snapdragon Specs helps in gauging AR functions like mapping physical spaces for digital objects to be seamlessly placed or overlaid.

Snapdragon Specs also helps in hand-tracking with AR, allowing the user to move around and adjust objects in the metaverse with just hand gestures. Neither Qualcomm nor Microsoft provided details on the availability of the chips or the AR headsets.

The collaboration will see both the companies work together to develop a custom AR chip for future AR Glasses, which will incorporate both the Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer platforms.

The new custom augmented reality Snapdragon chip will be for power-efficient and lightweight AR Glasses that will open doors for rich and immersive experiences. The partnership is said to be a reflection of both Qualcomm and Microsoft's ""shared commitment to XR and the metaverse.""

The future custom chip will include both the Microsoft Mesh and the new Snapdragon Spaces XR platform, both of which try to provide mixed reality experiences across various devices.

While Mesh has support for a cross-platform VR/ AR system for virtual reality headsets, tablets, smartphones, and PCs, the Snapdragon platform is meant to create more AR-specific apps and even convert a Snapdragon chipset-powered phone as the ""secondary screen"" for a mixed reality experience. It will be interesting to see how these two merge to create a more immersive AR/ VR experience in the future.

Hugo Swart, Vice President and General Manager of XR, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc, in a press release said, ""Qualcomm Technologies' core XR strategy has always been delivering the most cutting-edge technology, purpose-built XR chipsets, and enabling the ecosystem with our software platforms and hardware reference designs. We are thrilled to work with Microsoft to help expand and scale the adoption of AR hardware and software across the entire industry.""

For those who don't know, Microsoft and Qualcomm have worked together on AR projects in the past as well. The Microsoft HoloLens 2 mixed reality headset that launched back in 2019 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 chipset. Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 chip is also seen on the Oculus Quest 2.

Intel announced that it's working on a foldable laptop spec during its CES 2022 presentation. While foldable screens aren't new, they haven't yet gained traction in the laptop market, which is somewhat strange considering that laptops naturally fold anyway. Intel says the first devices with folding display tech will begin shipping this year. We could see some rather exciting devices and form factors.

The spec is a part of Intel's Evo platform. It's essentially a set of guidelines that lay out the features and requirements for thin laptops with a long battery life, fast wakeup and modern connectivity. In some ways Evo can be considered Ultrabook 2.0.

Foldable laptops open up an interesting range of use cases. You could use one as a tablet, a tabletop like you might use a 2-in-1 or even like a book. You can use one as a standard laptop with a virtual keyboard, or add a keyboard accessory. The latter is something that a gamer would likely use.

Devices with foldable screens aren't new. Several high end smartphones feature the tech, but it is relatively new for laptops, with notable exceptions such as the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold. Microsoft was working on a dual screen Surface device but it never came to fruition. At least not yet anyway.

Foldable screens require operating system support, and Windows 11 isn't yet optimised to support foldable display tech. Without that support, foldable laptops won't be able to gain a significant foothold. It will surely happen in time, and if Intel's prediction that devices will appear this year is accurate, then Microsoft surely has it penciled in on the roadmap.

If foldable laptops do become a force in the market, Intel is well positioned. It's 12th Gen mobile CPUs appear to be strong, and its Arc GPUs are also poised to appear in larger form factors and devices aimed at gamers.

As we move forward into 2022, we can expect to see Intel and its partners gradually reveal their foldable laptops. Computex in mid year would seem like a good time to show off some designs. It will be interesting to see how AMD will react, if at all. Don't forget, there's also Qualcomm. The company believes it is well positioned to capture some of the laptop market.

The mobile space is looking very exciting in 2022. Stay tuned.","{'uri': 'pcgamer.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'pcgamer'}","[{'uri': 'chris_szewczyk@pcgamer.com', 'name': 'Chris Szewczyk', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgxgpUdt664Z25nNiyU2DH-1200-80.jpg,0.1450980392156862,eng-7386121,False,0.8039215803146362,0.1450980392156862,379060260,1

How about a mainstream phone that doesn't compromise much on other features and still manages to deliver on ruggedness. Such a device could be a good purchase for anyone who's clumsy or has a bit of rough usage. If you can relate, the Nokia XR20 is worth considering. Read on to find out more about the handset in our review.

Before we talk about the durability aspects of the Nokia XR20, let's get down to the hardware and specifications of the handset. The smartphone flaunts a 6.67-inch Full HD+ (1080 x 2400) LCD panel with a 20:9 aspect ratio and 550 nits peak brightness. The screen gets a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, the toughest glass for mobile screen protection. The phone is powered by an 8nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G chipset paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage.

These specs aren't in line with the current market standards but should do well for basic phone tasks. The internal memory can be expanded to up to 512GB via a microSD card slot. The XR20 has a non-removable 4,630mAh battery cell that supports 18W wired charging and 15W wireless charging with compatible Qi wireless chargers. For connectivity, the XR20 has Bluetooth 5.1, 3.5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, NFC, Wi-Fi dual-band (2.4GHz + 5.0GHz) and support for ten 5G bands.

The XR20 runs on stock Android 11 and comes with a promise of three years of upgrades. It comes equipped with a side-mounted physical fingerprint scanner. For cameras, the handset boasts a dual-lens rear camera featuring a 48MP f/1.79 main camera accompanied by a 13MP ultrawide f/2.4 lens with 123°FoV. The XR20 has an 8MP f/2.0 selfie camera.

Moving on, the phone also has a tiny loop at the bottom left corner to extend practical use cases of field job professionals. It can be used to tie a thread to hook the device with a keychain or to any other item of daily use.

When the non-rugged Nokia phones offer higher material strength and durability than the competition, you can imagine how far a dedicated ultra-durable rugged Nokia smartphone can go. Made out of a hard polymer composite material with a mix of aluminium around the sides, the XR20 is indeed designed for the long run. The smartphone is MIL-STD-810H military standard certified for scratch-resistance, drop-resistance, temperature resistance and water resistance (IP68 rated).

It handled multiple drops on hard concrete without gathering any visible scratches and dents for that matter. Long story short, you won't need a third-party case for this handset even if your daily routine involves rough handling of your most personal electronic device. The phone's body is itself an ultra-solid case that can withstand a great deal of torture, be it water damage, dust and mud damage and hard drops on tough surfaces.

The toughened polymer casing extends a millimetre beyond the display to prevent the screen from any possible damage that can be caused by a hard impact. And even if anything solid falls on the display, the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus effectively absorbs the impact. It's the toughest treated glass yet for smartphones/tablets and is usually found on premium flagship smartphones from top smartphone brands.

The XR20 isn't an ideal device for one-hand use. The hard casing and the large display makes the XR20 a big and bulky smartphone (171.64 x 81.50 x 10.64), which is difficult to carry around (248 g) and operate with one hand. But that's something given for a big phablet that is made to last at least half a decade even with rigorous use.

I don't mind the hard shell and bulkiness but the screen size could have been a beet smaller to offer better ergonomics. Many might disagree as big screens are generally preferable for media consumption.

One positive thing about the large display is the big screen real-estate on offer. It allows for immersive media playback, comfortable multitasking and good enough space for reading and browsing web pages. The IPS LCD screen doesn't match the color vibrancy and smoothness of 90/120Hz refresh rate AMOLED panels on offer at the same pricing; however, it doesn't disappoint with its brightness and touch response. I could read the text and watch videos outdoors without any visibility issues.

The XR20 gets the basics right. It offers a 3.5mm audio jack, Type-C USB charging port, and a hybrid dual-SIM slot with microSD support (Up to 512GB). The volume rockers and a physical power button/fingerprint scanner rest on an aluminium edge on the right whereas a dedicated Google Assistant button (Non-configurable) is placed on the left edge.

You also get a programmable button positioned on the top edge for emergency situations. It can be used to alert contacts in case of any emergency or can be configured to perform other important shortcuts such as change of sound profile, turn on/off hotspot, flight mode, screen recorder, sound recorder, torch, calculator, etc.

The XR20 runs smoothly for day-to-day tasks without any performance issues. Thanks to stock Android software and ample RAM, the handset easily handles light to heavy tasks. You can run multiple apps, shoot 1080p 60fps videos, use Google chrome with multiple pages open at a time, and can even play some demanding games at lower settings without any major performance drops. The budget phone-like hardware is no slouch as long as it is not forced to compete with competition handsets in the sub-45K price-point.

For instance, if you compare the XR20's hardware (display, CPU & RAM) and its performance to any of the value flagship smartphones from OnePlus, Xiaomi or Realme, you will feel disappointed. These handsets offer the best possible chipsets, fluid 120Hz displays and better cameras at the same pricing. What they lack is the Military-grade rugged design and practicality of the XR20 that makes a strong case for the rugged handset.

As far as the battery life is concerned, the 4,630mAh battery cell lasts mostly a day with heavy usage. With moderate use, the battery can go as long as one and a half days. Nokia could have added a 5,000mAh battery cell but then it would have made the device even bulkier. The bundled 18W charger takes around 2.5 hours to refuel the battery from flat to 100%. The handset also supports 15W wireless charging with Qi-compatible wireless chargers.

Like Nokia's budget handsets, the XR20 also runs on stock Android skin (Android 11) and does not throw unnecessary notifications and advertisements. There's no bloatware and you only get the most important and widely used apps such as Google ecosystem apps, Netflix and Spotify. Nokia has added some useful customization features in display settings and the camera app. As far as the software upgrade cycle is concerned, Nokia has promised three years of software updates for the handset.

Similar to its underlying hardware, the cameras on the XR20 are best described as slightly above average. There's a 48MP primary sensor capable of taking 48MP full-res. shots with good clarity and decent dynamic range. The 12MP pixel-binned shots only come out crisp and vivid when the lighting conditions are favourable. The low-light shots aren't satisfactory and probably look as average as pictures shot from a sub-15K handset.

The camera's autofocus mechanism is quick and there's no lag in processing pictures, something we have experienced on budget Nokia handsets.

On the other hand, the video taking capabilities and the add-ons provided are quite impressive. You can record 1080p 60fps videos that look crisp and vivid and show a good dynamic range. The camera has software-based stabilization (EIS) but sadly it's not much of a help. Nokia should have at least given OIS on the primary camera to add more value to the add-on features discussed below.

The XR20 lacks a dedicated depth sensor but you can still take some good looking portraits, thanks to a portrait mode backed by a range of ZEISS filters. These include- ZEISS Modern, Swirl, Smooth, Classic, Star and Heart. Each of these modes alters the background blur effect and is best worked with some artificial lights in the background.

As far as the portraits are concerned, pictures with human subjects show natural skin tones and decent edge detection. Some shots with non-human subjects came out even better showing impressive bokeh, vibrant colors and good clarity. Moving on, the 13MP wide-angle shots are very average and fail to impress. Nokia should have provided a better sensor or could have tuned this one better.

Overall, I am quite impressed with the Nokia XR20's camera features. With better hardware, the XR20 could have made for an amazing camera smartphone.

The XR20 is a one-of-its-kind value flagship smartphone with a clear focus on delivering a rugged phone user experience without compromising much on a mainstream smartphone appeal. Even though it lacks the latest hardware and the subsequent performance aspects, the phone's unparalleled durability factor compensates for the losses. If you are in the market for a rugged phone, there's no better option than the XR20.

The handset comes from the trusted brand of Nokia and brings with it the goodness of stock Android software with a solid software upgrade cycle. The camera hardware isn't cutting edge but the camera app and the add-on features make it pretty exciting. The same goes for the underlying hardware and the display on offer. If you can compromise on such features for the durability factor, the XR20 is the rugged handset to go for. The handset is priced at Rs. 46,999 in the Indian market.","{'uri': 'gizbot.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gizbot'}","[{'uri': 'rohit_arora@gizbot.com', 'name': 'Rohit Arora', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.gizbot.com/img/2022/01/nokia-xr20-review-1641360545.jpg?05012022110657,0.2,,False,0,0.2,379057020,1

Qualcomm also said that Honda will start using its ""cockpit"" chips in vehicles that will hit roads in 2023. Qualcomm also said Renault has agreed to use its automotive technology, but did not give specifics of which chips or when vehicles using them would arrive.

Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it has created a new chip and system for computer vision, which uses cameras on the car and artificial intelligence to help with safety functions like automatic lane control. The new ""Snapdragon Ride Vision System"" uses software from Arriver, which was part of Qualcomm's $4.5 billion purchase of automotive technology firm Veoneer Inc last year.","{'uri': 'gadgetsnow.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gadget Now'}",[],"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,msid-88704091,imgsize-150284,width-800/88704091.jpg",0.1215686274509804,,True,0,0.1215686274509804,379056180,5

""The seminal telecom sector reforms package announced by the government of India has significantly boosted the outlook and investor confidence for the industry while simplifying the license framework,"" the company said in a statement Tuesday evenirng.

Airtel said with a strong balance sheet and 5G ready network, it was already well poised to invest aggressively in the emerging growth opportunities offered by India's digital economy.

""The board of directors of Airtel is of the view that the existing corporate structure of the company is, therefore, optimal for leveraging these emerging opportunities and unlocking value while continuing to scale up Airtel's digital business,"" the statement said. As a result, the scheme of arrangement for the new corporate structure announced on April 14, 2021 stood withdrawn.

The company's businesses continue to be categorised under four key verticals - India, Digital, International and Infrastructure.

ET had reported in its November 22 edition that Airtel was considering withdrawing the plan since the government had redefined the contentious Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) to exclude non-telecom revenue under the telecom reforms package announced on September 15.

The Airtel stock ended 0.9% higher at Rs 697.20 on the BSE Wednesday.

'Airtel's corporate structure rejig was originally aimed at segregating its revenues from the connectivity and digital services businesses, and in turn, reducing its statutory payouts towards licence fees and spectrum usage charges (SUC). But that need has now disappeared as exclusion of non-telecom revenue in computation of AGR under the latter's new definition will automatically result in big savings in Airtel's regulatory payouts towards both licence fees and SUC,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage.

""This could be a key reason behind Airtel's decision to dump its corporate restructuring plan,"" the analyst added.

In April, Bharti Airtel unveiled a new corporate structure, separating its telecom business from other businesses. The new structure was to see the listed parent house the digital and infrastructure assets, while moving the telecom businesses to a newly created unit, Airtel Ltd.

A mobile operator pays licence fees and spectrum usage charges to the government based on its AGR. Thus, higher the AGR, higher the payouts. Telcos had initially excluded non-telecom items while calculating AGR. However, the Supreme Court had in September 2019 backed the telecom department's definition of AGR to include non-telecom items.

This meant that revenue from, for example, a telco's fast-growing digital services and related segments would also get added onto revenue from a company's direct telecom services while calculating AGR. This increased telcos' payouts in the form of higher LF and SUC.

However, after the government redefined AGR from October 1, the scenario changed.

The government has removed all non-telecom items while calculating AGR. Items such as gains from forex fluctuations, insurance claims, capital gains on account of sale of fixed assets and securities, revenue from activities under the I&B licence, and revenue from operations other than telecom activities were excluded from gross revenue to arrive at the AGR.

Airtel added that under a modified scheme, the company, as previously approved by the board, would merge its wholly owned subsidiary Telesonic Networks Limited, resulting in consolidation of its fibre assets into Airtel.

In addition, Nettle Infrastructure Investments Limited will also be merged with Airtel. ""As announced earlier, the company will pursue its plan to eventually fold the DTH business (Bharti Telemedia) into Airtel to move towards the NDCP vision of converged services to customers,"" the statement said.","{'uri': 'gadgetsnow.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gadget Now'}",[],"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,msid-88704012,imgsize-107086,width-800/88704012.jpg",0.3411764705882352,eng-7382698,False,0.6549019813537598,0.3411764705882352,379056000,1

S&P Global Platts Analytics has projected that the shortage hindering global vehicle production is poised to persist into 2022 before supply catches up with demand in early 2023. Light-vehicle production in 2022 is expected to shed 5.7 million units as the shortages impact production facilities worldwide.

The Boston Consulting Group expects the shortfall in vehicle production to last into 2024 before stabilizing in 2025. The lower lower vehicle output will affect demand for a range of commodities, steel and other materials.

The drop in vehicle production has impacted the automotive sector's demand for steel, resulting in a buildup of steel inventories, especially for hot-rolled coil. Several vehicle makers have cancelled volumes agreed upon under long-term contracts and remain uncertain over how much steel to secure in future long-term contracts amid reduced production forecasts.

In response, steelmakers have taken to diverting the surplus for export in the hope that other steel-intensive sectors, such as heavy machinery and construction, can absorb the excess.

The World Steel Association had projected that disruptions in the supply chain were significantly undermining the global automotive industry's recovery, noting that as pent-up demand dissipated, the growth in auto production in 2022 will decelerate, though high order backlogs could provide some support.

Asian ADC12 aluminum alloy, a major material used for automotive parts production, also faced weaker demand and falling raw materials prices in the last quarter of 2021 that will likely continue into 2022.

The lower vehicle output has affected platinum group metals demand in all key auto-producing centers -- which account for around 40%-80% of PGM end-use -- according to UK brokerage Liberum analysts. Heraeus Precious Metals estimated the fall in global light-vehicle production for 2021 amounted to a drop of around 1.4 million oz of PGMs in 2021, with platinum demand decreasing 230,000 oz, palladium down 1.1 million oz and rhodium dropping 161,000 oz.

Although chip makers have pledged billions to expand production capacity in the coming years, it will take some time for the fresh capacity to come online. A semiconductor fabrication plant, or fab/foundry, costs $10 billion-$20 billion and takes 3-5 years to build.

Governments have joined the push to build chip capacity, notably India, which aims to become a global hub for electronics manufacturing with semiconductors as the foundation. India's cabinet on Dec. 15 approved Rupees 760 billion ($10.17 billion) to develop a domestic semiconductor and display manufacturing industry.

While the rampup takes shape, the automotive industry will have to compete for chips with other industries, especially those affected by the ""stay home"" effects of the coronavirus, such as surging demand for mobile phones, notebooks, gaming and wearables like virtual reality headsets. PlayStations and Xboxes were in very short supply during 2021.

The competition is acute as the automotive industry is not a major contributor to a foundry's revenue. The automotive sector accounted for 3.31% of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s annual revenue in 2020, well behind the smartphone sector at 48.18% and high performance computing at 32.84%. TSMC is said to be the world's largest contract manufacturer for semiconductor chips.

Fabs like TSMC have cautioned that the tight chip fabrication situation is unlikely to normalize even over 2022. The shortage inevitably means prices for chips are higher.

The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics has projected global chip sales to rise 8.8% year on year to $601.5 billion in 2022. after rising 25.6% to $553 billion in 2021 from $440.4 billion in 2020.

""The semiconductor market overall was not negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Robust consumer demand pushed all major product categories to double-digit growth rates except optoelectronics. The largest growth contributors are memory [chips] with 34.6%, followed by analog [chips] with 30.9% and logic [chips] with 27.3%,"" WSTS said Nov. 30.

As automakers grapple with the shortage, there is a growing push to tie up with global foundries to ensure chip supplies.

Ford Motor Co. and GlobalFoundries Inc. on Nov. 18 signed a non-binding agreement ""to create further semiconductor supply for Ford's current vehicle lineup and joint research and development to address the growing demand for feature-rich chips to support the automotive industry,"" the vehicle maker said.

General Motors could sign similar agreements with TSMC, Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors NV, and has an existing relationship with Qualcomm.

Automakers could also be more inclined to set up their own chip plants, as Toyota Motor did in 1989 when it started making chips at its Hirose plant. Toyota transferred core electronic component operations from the plant to Denso in April 2020, a domestic automotive components manufacturer that is 24.77% owned by Toyota. The Japanese company faced a shortage of parts in H2 2021 when COVID-19 spread in Southeast Asia, a main source of automotive components.

The developments seem to indicate that automakers are keen to have chip facilities on home ground or close to home, particularly as the pandemic disrupts supply chains, as the emergence of variants could mean disturbances will not ease anytime soon.","{'uri': 'spglobal.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'spglobal.com'}",[],,-0.2,eng-7384409,False,0.5607843399047852,-0.2,379053780,2

The pair was announced at CES on January 4th. Microsoft and Qualcomm are AR software, Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces XR (Mixed Reality) developer platforms.

Both companies are positioning these developments as an even more way to participate in the Metaverse. Some vaguely defined terms are used as an abbreviation for AR / XR, while others are used as synonyms for Web3 (whatever it is).

According to Qualcomm's press release on planned collaboration, the two are working on AR in both the consumer and enterprise sectors. Recently, Microsoft has focused primarily on AR / XR deliverables and their metaverse pitches in the enterprise sector. Qualcomm also talked about the vision of IoT Next as one way to plan to participate in the Metaverse.

Microsoft has previously partnered with Qualcomm to develop custom SQ1 and SQ2 chips for ARM-based Surface Pro X devices. Many AR / XR headsets such as Meta / Facebook's Oculus Quest and HoloLens 2 are built with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip. Microsoft has also worked with Qualcomm to try to gain momentum for Arm-based Windows PCs, but that effort hasn't made much progress in terms of customer mind share and industry market share.

Microsoft Mesh is the company's mixed reality platform with Azure, aimed at creating a shared presence across a variety of devices, for those who need a quick review. Microsoft talked about Mesh at the Build Developers Conference last spring. In the fall, Microsoft announced plans to bring Mesh to the Teams Group collaboration platform.

In a rare agreement under even rarer circumstances, both prosecutors and defense attorneys had recommended home confinement rather than time behind bars for Yisroel Goldstein. They cited his leadership in the weeks following the 2019 attack on Chabad of Poway, the immense physical and emotional trauma the former rabbi continues to battle, and his cooperation in the FBI's fraud investigation.

But the judge rejected that punishment as not appropriate given the severity of the crimes.

""You not only committed this offense yourself but you took a lot of people with you,"" U.S. District Court Judge Cynthia Bashant told Goldstein, 60.

""I think it's important to send a message to the community, and I think it's important to send a message to you,"" she added.

Goldstein must also pay about $2.8 million in restitution, an amount shared with several other defendants who were prosecuted as participants in the financial cons.

He must self-surrender by Feb. 23, although he could appeal for a later date if COVID-19 continues to surge. The judge agreed to recommend he be housed at a medium-security federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., which his defense attorney said is known to accommodate observant Jews.

As a rabbi in the Chabad movement -- which practices Orthodox Judaism but is also known for its welcoming nature -- Goldstein counted on the generosity of his congregation for his salary. He found other ways to supplement his income.

The FBI says Goldstein had his hand in a number of fraudulent schemes exploiting tax loopholes, corporate benevolence and government grant assistance.

Prosecutors said he personally earned at least $620,000 from the conspiracies.

The most prevalent of the schemes is known as the ""90/10"" fraud. Donors regularly made large charitable contributions to Chabad of Poway or one of its affiliated nonprofits, to be written off their taxes. But instead of the money going to the organizations, Goldstein secretly funneled 90 percent of it back to the donor, keeping 10 percent for himself. One donor got his donation returned in the form of $1 million in gold, prosecutors said.

At least a dozen people took Goldstein up on the tax-evasion scheme, resulting in at least $1.5 million in tax losses to the IRS, according to prosecutors.

In one variation on the scheme, donors would solicit their companies for matching charitable contributions. Goldstein would then return all of the original amount to the donor while keeping the corporation's matching funds. The corporations were given fraudulent donation receipts, and many took the tax deductions.

At least three Fortune 500 companies -- Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson and Northrup Grumman -- were defrauded out of nearly $145,000 total.

In deciding the sentence, the judge said she was struck by the number of people who Goldstein dragged down with him.

""Many of the individuals thought when they were committing their offense to benefit Chabad, the academy or synagogue or the organization in general, when in fact it was really just to benefit you,"" Bashant said. ""It was for your personal benefit and your own greed, and I can't ignore that fact.""

In a letter to the judge and further statements in court, Goldstein expressed deep remorse.

""I beg for mercy to accept my repentance and allow me to right the wrongs and be able to live out the rest of my life with remorse and to be given the chance to do whatever I can to help others to the best of my ability,"" he told the judge Tuesday.

Goldstein, who first launched the synagogue in Rancho Bernardo in the 1980s, was long known as a leader in the local Jewish community. But he became an international figure, delivering a powerful message against hate, when he and three members of his congregation were shot in an anti-Semitic attack on April 27, 2019. Congregant Lori Gilbert-Kaye, whom he described in court as like a sister, was killed.

The gunman, John T. Earnest, 22, was recently sentenced to two life terms in prison on both state and federal charges.

Bullets struck the rabbi in both hands, causing him to lose a finger and leaving another severely injured.

Still, in the hours and days after the attack he delivered words of hope -- from an impromptu speech while standing on a chair right after the shooting to appearances at the White House and United Nations.

No one knew at the time that he was the subject of a fraud investigation that had been open for more than a year.

Goldstein discovered he was being investigated in 2018 when the FBI searched his home and office. He immediately warned one co-conspirator of the investigation but soon after began cooperating with agents.

Goldstein stepped down as rabbi in November 2019, citing exhaustion. News of his crimes wasn't made public until the following summer, when he pleaded guilty to tax and wire fraud.

His misdeeds came to the attention of the FBI as agents were investigating a separate Ponzi scheme run by a San Diego real estate agent, Alexander Avergoon. The rabbi kept popping up in Avergoon's financial entanglements, and soon agents uncovered other long-running frauds.

With help from Avergoon, Goldstein applied for $937,000 in relief and grant money over the years, falsely claiming the funds were needed to upgrade security at the synagogue, repair nonexistent damage caused by 2007 wildfires, implement special programming or upgrade his living quarters.

The funds were awarded by federal and state emergency agencies and a private foundation out of Beverly Hills. The vast majority was pocketed.

Hannah Kaye, daughter of congregant killed in the shooting, attended the hearing Tuesday with her aunts to bear witness to Goldstein's fate.

""We hold him partially responsible for my mother's murder as a result of him stealing security grants meant to protect the synagogue that were instead used for his own personal gain,"" Kaye said in an interview.

She said she was taken aback by sentimental comments Goldstein made in court about his close relationship with her family.

""I believe that was an exploitive and manipulative tactic used as a way to elevate his victim status,"" she added.

Avergoon also helped Goldstein recruit donors for the ""90/10"" fraud, as well as apply for mortgages and a construction loan on false claims. In turn Goldstein falsely certified that Avergoon and his associates completed community service hours at Chabad as part of a court order.

Avergoon was sentenced by the same judge Monday to more than five years in prison for the schemes and an unrelated $12 million real estate Ponzi scheme in which investors thought they were buying into rental property.

To prepare for sentencing, Goldstein took the unusual step of producing a documentary-like video to submit to the court to tell his side of the story.

He dates his criminal actions to around 2010, when many of Chabad of Poway's major philanthropists had either moved away or died, and the full weight of the administration of the synagogue and its organizations fell on his shoulders. He said he was triggered by memories of the financial struggles of his boyhood as the ninth of 10 children in Brooklyn, and of the lean early days planting the synagogue in North County.

The fraud started small as a salve to the rising anxiety that he was battling about his ability to support himself and his growing family, he said.

""I have fallen prey and worshiped the Golden Calf of money,"" Goldstein wrote to the judge in a letter, referring to an Old Testament idol. ""I have let myself down and everything that I have taught, and everything that I have preached for 40 years, and allowed myself to be seduced to a very dark place, allowing the power of money to get the better part of my soul.""

However, the investigation found that some of Goldstein's schemes date back as early as the 1980s, including a long-running conspiracy to help at least one man shield more than $2 million from taxes in fake donations.

Goldstein is accused of helping his own brother in New York also hide $700,000 in income by depositing money in Chabad bank accounts, with the then-rabbi getting a cut. Mendel Goldstein has pleaded guilty and set to be sentenced next month.

By Stephen Nellis

Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday said it is working with Microsoft Corp on custom chips that would control lightweight augmented reality glasses for use by both consumers and businesses for metaverse apps.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said during a press conference that the two companies will work together to mate the custom chips with the software that developers need to create virtual worlds in which people can work and play.

He said that future devices from the collaboration will work with a Microsoft software product called Mesh that allows users to beam a realistic likeness of themselves into the headset of another user so that it feels like the two people are in the same room.

The future hardware will also use software from Qualcomm called Snapdragon Spaces that helps perform basic augmented reality functions like mapping out physical spaces so that digital objects can be overlaid on them and hand-tracking so that users can manipulate those digital objects with hand gestures.

""We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale,"" Amon, one of the few major tech executives not to cancel his physical presence at the trade show, said from a live-streamed talk on stage in Las Vegas.

The two companies did not give details about when the chips and headsets would be available.

""Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation,"" Ruben Caballero, corporate vice president for mixed reality at Microsoft, said in a statement.","{'uri': 'cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ETCIO.com'}",[],"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-88702480,imgsize-83936,width-1200,height-628,overlay-etcio/qualcomm-microsoft-partner-on-metaverse-chip-for-ar-glasses.jpg",0.4666666666666666,,True,0,0.4666666666666666,379051140,3

And it will enable a host of new business models in every sector, many of which we can't even imagine today - just as 4G enabled ride-sharing services, livestreaming, and, indeed, the entire smartphone revolution.

It's a technology that the US and China are fighting for supremacy over. Because whoever wins, will reap the biggest economic gains from it. Yes, 5G will have a transformational impact. And 2022 will be when India will likely see its first 5G roll outs.

As it does, consumers will experience faster data speeds on mobile networks, better quality video calls, instant movie downloads, online gaming with delightful special effects. For enterprises, it will make concepts such as 'smart factories' and 'connected workplaces' a reality. And it will enable a host of new business models in every sector, many of which we can't even imagine today - just as 4G enabled ride-sharing services, livestreaming, and, indeed, the entire smartphone revolution.

Rajen Vagadia, president at Qualcomm India, says the company is designing 5G platforms that deliver high cellular speeds, increased coverage, and enhanced power efficiency. While smartphones continue to be an area of focus, the chip company - which has a large R&D centre in India - has also developed capabilities across industries such as automotive, mobile computing, gaming, and telecom infrastructure. In-vehicle experiences, he says, will be transformed with solutions such as telematics, digital cockpit, automatic driver assistance systems (ADAS)/autonomous driving, and cellular vehicle-to-everything.

In education, 5G fixed wireless broadband will help bridge the existing gaps in fibre reach. Smart city projects involving automatic meter reading, traffic light management, and waste management will become a lot more robust.

Tasleem Arif, R&D head at smartphone maker Oppo India, says the team at its India 5G innovation lab set up last year in Hyderabad executed the first 5G WhatsApp video call testing. ""We did the video call displaying the 5G band and speed. We also demonstrated fast movie downloads and cloud gaming features,"" he says.

It has even conducted the first 5G VoNR (Voice/Video on New Radio) call, a solution that will enable superior call quality, resulting in users enjoying instant connections as well as clearer sound from callers with almost no background noise.

Arif says that while most 5G tests in India involved non-standalone models, Oppo developed their solutions on standalone platforms. The non-standalone architecture (NSA) anchors the control signalling of 5G radio networks to the 4G core, while the standalone architecture (SA) connects the 5G radio directly to the 5G core network. The former will bring the higher speeds of 5G. The latter will, in addition, enable the development of totally new services and business models because the 5G core is a fully virtualised, cloud-native architecture that introduces new ways to develop, deploy, and manage services.

Sajan Paul, country manager for India & Saarc at Juniper Networks, says 5G will unlock a number of B2B use cases quickly. Such as factories served by wirelessly controlled robots. In these environments, even the smallest moving parts will be wirelessly tracked, operated, and managed along the production line. Retailers, he says, will offer new immersive experiences in trying, styling, and buying products, whether in brick-and-mortar stores or outside of stores.

In healthcare, remote surgery and connected ambulances will help save lives in areas where it's impossible for doctors to reach. This was demonstrated in the UK where a camera based in an ambulance transmitted high-definition footage to a remote clinician with close to zero latency thanks to Ericsson's 5G technology. Using a VR headset and a joystick, the clinician remotely guided a paramedic through a series of procedures based on haptic glove technology.

Monika Gupta, 5G & edge computing lead for industry use cases at Capgemini, says 5G will complement other technologies like edge computing, IoT, AI/ML, cloud, analytics to create innovative and impactful business applications. 5G standalone technology solutions for private networks, she says, are now commercially available, and the 5G chip and device ecosystem is growing fast, setting the ground for mass adoption in the coming two to three years. A private 5G network is a wireless local area network (LAN) that uses 5G-enabled technologies to create a network with dedicated bandwidth and infrastructure that meets a company's specific connectivity needs. Capgemini launched a 5G lab in Mumbai last year to help clients experiment with and deploy 5G and edge technologies.

Manish Vyas, president for Tech Mahindra's communications, media and entertainment business, and CEO of its network services, says a major chunk of the company's contract signings will be around either integrating or enabling 5G, with a scaled adoption of cloud and driving greater intelligence into the network systems via analytics and AI.

Tech Mahindra recently designed, built, tested and operated one of the world's first 5G end-to-end cloud native platforms for a tier-1 carrier in Japan. The platform enables hyper-personalisation and hyper-automation.","{'uri': 'cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ETCIO.com'}",[],"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-88702521,imgsize-5062,width-1200,height-628,overlay-etcio/5g-s-not-just-about-speed-it-will-enable-amazing-new-biz-models.jpg",0.3019607843137255,,False,0,0.3019607843137255,379051140,1

In a rare agreement under even rarer circumstances, both prosecutors and defense attorneys had recommended home confinement rather than time behind bars for Yisroel Goldstein. They cited his leadership in the weeks following the 2019 attack on Chabad of Poway, the immense physical and emotional trauma the former rabbi continues to battle, and his cooperation in the FBI's fraud investigation.

But the judge rejected that punishment as not appropriate given the severity of the crimes.

""You not only committed this offense yourself but you took a lot of people with you,"" U.S. District Court Judge Cynthia Bashant told Goldstein, 60.

""I think it's important to send a message to the community, and I think it's important to send a message to you,"" she added.

Goldstein must also pay about $2.8 million in restitution, an amount shared with several other defendants who were prosecuted as participants in the financial cons.

He must self-surrender by Feb. 23, although he could appeal for a later date if COVID-19 continues to surge. The judge agreed to recommend he be housed at a medium-security federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., which his defense attorney said is known to accommodate observant Jews.

As a rabbi in the Chabad movement -- which practices Orthodox Judaism but is also known for its welcoming nature -- Goldstein counted on the generosity of his congregation for his salary. He found other ways to supplement his income.

The FBI says Goldstein had his hand in a number of fraudulent schemes exploiting tax loopholes, corporate benevolence and government grant assistance.

Prosecutors said he personally earned at least $620,000 from the conspiracies.

The most prevalent of the schemes is known as the ""90/10"" fraud. Donors regularly made large charitable contributions to Chabad of Poway or one of its affiliated nonprofits, to be written off their taxes. But instead of the money going to the organizations, Goldstein secretly funneled 90 percent of it back to the donor, keeping 10 percent for himself. One donor got his donation returned in the form of $1 million in gold, prosecutors said.

At least a dozen people took Goldstein up on the tax-evasion scheme, resulting in at least $1.5 million in tax losses to the IRS, according to prosecutors.

In one variation on the scheme, donors would solicit their companies for matching charitable contributions. Goldstein would then return all of the original amount to the donor while keeping the corporation's matching funds. The corporations were given fraudulent donation receipts, and many took the tax deductions.

At least three Fortune 500 companies -- Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson and Northrup Grumman -- were defrauded out of nearly $145,000 total.

In deciding the sentence, the judge said she was struck by the number of people who Goldstein dragged down with him.

""Many of the individuals thought when they were committing their offense to benefit Chabad, the academy or synagogue or the organization in general, when in fact it was really just to benefit you,"" Bashant said. ""It was for your personal benefit and your own greed, and I can't ignore that fact.""

In a letter to the judge and further statements in court, Goldstein expressed deep remorse.

""I beg for mercy to accept my repentance and allow me to right the wrongs and be able to live out the rest of my life with remorse and to be given the chance to do whatever I can to help others to the best of my ability,"" he told the judge Tuesday.

Goldstein, who first launched the synagogue in Rancho Bernardo in the 1980s, was long known as a leader in the local Jewish community. But he became an international figure, delivering a powerful message against hate, when he and three members of his congregation were shot in an anti-Semitic attack on April 27, 2019. Congregant Lori Gilbert-Kaye, whom he described in court as like a sister, was killed.

The gunman, John T. Earnest, 22, was recently sentenced to two life terms in prison on both state and federal charges.

Bullets struck the rabbi in both hands, causing him to lose a finger and leaving another severely injured.

Still, in the hours and days after the attack he delivered words of hope -- from an impromptu speech while standing on a chair right after the shooting to appearances at the White House and United Nations.

No one knew at the time that he was the subject of a fraud investigation that had been open for more than a year.

Goldstein discovered he was being investigated in 2018 when the FBI searched his home and office. He immediately warned one co-conspirator of the investigation but soon after began cooperating with agents.

Goldstein stepped down as rabbi in November 2019, citing exhaustion. News of his crimes wasn't made public until the following summer, when he pleaded guilty to tax and wire fraud.

His misdeeds came to the attention of the FBI as agents were investigating a separate Ponzi scheme run by a San Diego real estate agent, Alexander Avergoon. The rabbi kept popping up in Avergoon's financial entanglements, and soon agents uncovered other long-running frauds.

With help from Avergoon, Goldstein applied for $937,000 in relief and grant money over the years, falsely claiming the funds were needed to upgrade security at the synagogue, repair nonexistent damage caused by 2007 wildfires, implement special programming or upgrade his living quarters.

The funds were awarded by federal and state emergency agencies and a private foundation out of Beverly Hills. The vast majority was pocketed.

Hannah Kaye, daughter of congregant killed in the shooting, attended the hearing Tuesday with her aunts to bear witness to Goldstein's fate.

""We hold him partially responsible for my mother's murder as a result of him stealing security grants meant to protect the synagogue that were instead used for his own personal gain,"" Kaye said in an interview.

She said she was taken aback by sentimental comments Goldstein made in court about his close relationship with her family.

""I believe that was an exploitive and manipulative tactic used as a way to elevate his victim status,"" she added.

Avergoon also helped Goldstein recruit donors for the ""90/10"" fraud, as well as apply for mortgages and a construction loan on false claims. In turn Goldstein falsely certified that Avergoon and his associates completed community service hours at Chabad as part of a court order.

Avergoon was sentenced by the same judge Monday to more than five years in prison for the schemes and an unrelated $12 million real estate Ponzi scheme in which investors thought they were buying into rental property.

To prepare for sentencing, Goldstein took the unusual step of producing a documentary-like video to submit to the court to tell his side of the story.

He dates his criminal actions to around 2010, when many of Chabad of Poway's major philanthropists had either moved away or died, and the full weight of the administration of the synagogue and its organizations fell on his shoulders. He said he was triggered by memories of the financial struggles of his boyhood as the ninth of 10 children in Brooklyn, and of the lean early days planting the synagogue in North County.

The fraud started small as a salve to the rising anxiety that he was battling about his ability to support himself and his growing family, he said.

""I have fallen prey and worshiped the Golden Calf of money,"" Goldstein wrote to the judge in a letter, referring to an Old Testament idol. ""I have let myself down and everything that I have taught, and everything that I have preached for 40 years, and allowed myself to be seduced to a very dark place, allowing the power of money to get the better part of my soul.""

However, the investigation found that some of Goldstein's schemes date back as early as the 1980s, including a long-running conspiracy to help at least one man shield more than $2 million from taxes in fake donations.

Goldstein is accused of helping his own brother in New York also hide $700,000 in income by depositing money in Chabad bank accounts, with the then-rabbi getting a cut. Mendel Goldstein has pleaded guilty and set to be sentenced next month.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm chief executive Cristiano Amon said during a press conference that the two companies will work together to mate the custom chips with the software that developers need to create virtual worlds in which people can work and play.

He said that future devices from the collaboration will work with a Microsoft software product called Mesh that allows users to beam a realistic likeness of themselves into the headset of another user so that it feels like the two people are in the same room.

The future hardware will also use software from Qualcomm called Snapdragon Spaces that helps perform basic augmented reality functions like mapping out physical spaces so that digital objects can be overlaid on them and hand-tracking so that users can manipulate those digital objects with hand gestures.

""We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale,"" Amon, one of the few major tech executives not to cancel his physical presence at the trade show, said from a live-streamed talk on stage in Las Vegas.

The two companies did not give details about when the chips and headsets would be available.

Honor Magic V foldable smartphone to launch on January 10,"Beijing: Honor has confirmed that the brand's first foldable smartphone 'Honor Magic V' will be officially launched in its home market China on January 10.

According to the teaser poster, the upcoming phone will house a triple-camera setup on the back with the camera sensors placed vertically.

The Honor Magic V will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and come pre-loaded with Android 12 out of the box, reports GSMArena.

The large internal display has a punch-hole cutout in the upper right corner while the external cover display will have a centered punch hole camera.

Magic V's front display supports a 90Hz refresh rate, whereas the inner screen offers a 120Hz refresh rate.

Recently, Honor CEO Zhao revealed that the Magic V foldable smartphone is equipped with the company's self-developed patented hinge technology which is said to be the thinnest in the industry.

The foldable smartphones are rising in popularity. According to techARC, foldable smartphones are set to witness a massive 638 per cent jump in sales in India in 2021 and are expected to touch a record three lakh units sales in 2022.

After Samsung, Chinese brand OPPO has also launched its maiden foldable smartphone called 'Find N' that comes with triple-camera at the rear, selfie cameras on both inner and outer displays, Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset and up to 12GB RAM.","{'uri': 'zeenews.india.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Zee News'}",[],https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2022/01/05/1002457-honormagic.jpg,0.2784313725490195,,True,0,0.2784313725490195,379049220,1

And he said the company is designing ""everyday sustainability"" into its products.

""Samsung has made sustainability part of everything we do,"" Han said. ""Our product cycles are geared to minimize the impact to the environment.""

Some of that sounds like a contradiction, as the thousands of companies at CES in Las Vegas are dedicated to making tech products for conspicuous consumption.

But Han said that small changes can make a big difference in carbon footprints, and so Samsung has focused on its sustainable technology journey. Last year, Samsung's carbon emissions for chips were down 700,000 tons last year, he said.

He also said Samsung is including more recycled materials in its products, using 30 times more recycled plastics than it did the year before. The company plans to expand use of recycled materials in all of its products by 2025.

""We are not done,"" he said.

Inside the box, Samsung is getting rid of styrofoam, box holders, and plastics. Last year, the company introduced a solar cell remote control, which recharges itself from the lights in your home. Samsung is upgrading it this year using wireless signals to help recharge it.

By 2025, the company will make TVs and phones work on near-zero standby power, Han said.

And the company is doing something about e-waste. When you line up discarded batteries, you can get a line from Las Vegas to South Korea, he said. Since 2009, Samsung has collected five million tons of e-waste. Last year, it introduced Galaxy for the Planet, a sustainability platform.

Samsung is collaborating with Patagonia, the outdoor company, to eliminate micro-plastic waste that makes its way into nature. They're working on filters that can catch micro-plastic waste in washing machines so the waste stays out of the water.

As for products, Samsung showed off a Freestyle projector that projects anything you want onto walls, or down from a light fixture onto a table. The two-pound device can project a 100-inch image on a wall, and you can send content to it with a Samsung Galaxy phone by tapping it. You can even personalize a wall with a fake window. You can manage content with your voice.

Samsung also unveiled a horizontal or vertical screen called Odyssey Ark, a new kind of gaming screen. It is 55 inches horizontal, and it has a curved design, pulling you into the screen. You control it with a wireless wheel controller.

It has multiview options so you can watch a bunch of things at once. This can make use of the Samsung Gaming Hub, which lets you play cloud games on Samsung smart TVs.

The carbon footprint of CES is definitely lower this year, due to the pandemic.

Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, said before the keynote that after two years of relying on technology, our expectations for relying on it are even higher. CES 2022 is taking place in Las Vegas in-person, even though many companies like Intel pulled out at the last minute out of concerns over the Omicron variant of COVID-19.

Many people like me bailed out of the show (I'm watching it all virtually), but there is a smaller and dedicated crowd that showed up, as the keynote room was packed, and Qualcomm's CEO Cristiano Amon noted that his press event room was about 80% full. CES estimated half the attendees would come compared to past years, and that 2,000 or so exhibitors would show up.

Han said we have to all get together and do more to make a more sustainable world.","{'uri': 'venturebeat.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'VentureBeat'}","[{'uri': 'dean_takahashi@venturebeat.com', 'name': 'Dean Takahashi', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/samsung.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,0.1294117647058823,eng-7384462,False,0.6549019813537598,0.1294117647058823,379048800,1

The Soundform Immerse feature what Belkin is calling Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation, with three microphones per earbud (two external and one internal). This achieves noise cancellation using a combination of feedforward and feedback processing. The earbuds include Qualcomm's aptX HD streaming technology for 24-bit sound quality.

The Soundform Immerse feature 12mm dual-layer drivers with neodymium magnets and deliver frequency response from 20Hz to 20kHz, with a sensitivity rating of 98dB SPL. They're outfitted with Bluetooth 5.2 radios and support the A2DP, HFP, and AVRCP profiles.

Listeners can use a physical button on each earbud to control noise-cancelling settings and Belkin's Hear-Thru mode (aka transparency mode, so you can hear your surroundings).

Belkin built in multiple ways to locate your Immerse earbuds and their case. Belkin has a long made accessories compatible with Apple devices and they've incorporated the company's new Find My technology into the Immerse. You can use Apple's Find My Network to locate a missing charging case. You can use Belkin's Soundform app on your iPhone to locate a missing earbud with its Ping My Earbuds feature.

The Soundform app also gives users extra control over their listening environment. Use the app to dial in your preferred EQ curve or choose one of Belkin's presets. A real bonus is the fact that the app also allows users to adjust their Hear-Thru levels to their personal taste.

The Immerse headphones offer 8 hours playback from each earbud plus another 28 hours of battery time from the charging case. The case works with Qi charging or can be plugged in to charge with the included USB-C cable. In a pinch, a ten-minute charge gives the earbuds a full hour of playback.

The earbuds have an IPX5 sweatproof and waterproof rating. Android owners can quickly connect to the Immerse via Google's Fast Pairing technology. There are 3 sizes of silicone ear tips and silicone wing tips to ensure a perfect fit.

The Belkin Soundform Immerse will be available in Spring 2022. While pricing has not been finalized, Belkin tells us it expects them to sell in the $150 to $199 range.

Without most of its high-wattage stars and facing escalating criticism for its decision to press on despite a record surge in COVID cases, CES 2022 officially starts Wednesday.

Just days after an estimated crowd of 300,000 jammed into Las Vegas for a New Year's Eve fireworks show, tens of thousands of members of the tech industry descended on the Strip. (In an admission to the threat of omicron, show organizers Consumer Technology Association late Friday announced the four-day show had been shaved to three days, Wednesday through Friday. Saturday is typically moving day.)

Intel Corp. INTC, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, all of whom passed on attending in person, did make announcements remotely on Tuesday:

* AMD shows off $200 graphics card and new chips in CES presentation, stock falls

* Nvidia reveals $249 gaming card, as well as a 'BFGPU,' at CES 2022

* Intel focuses on autonomous driving, gaming and laptop chips at CES 2022

Despite more than 150 companies -- including many of the biggest names in tech -- choosing to opt out of in-person appearances, the show goes on. Indeed, some jittery attendees might want to stop by and visit one of several exhibitors with anti-COVID technology.

""We expect a lot of interest,"" Mark Lyle, co-founder and chief technology officer at LumixUV, developer of robotic disinfection technology for point-of-sales terminals at retail stores, gas stations, and airport kiosks, told MarketWatch.

The technology uses high-poweredUV-C LED lights(ultraviolet) to pass over the POS terminal system and disinfect at a level comparable to Lysol or alcohol, without the risk of damaging the terminal while applying liquid disinfectants.

Ironically, the outbreak of omicron could prove to be fortuitous for LumixUV, a Florida-based company that doesn't have nearly the exposure to investors that startups in California and New York enjoy. ""(CES) is important for us,"" Lyle said, ""though the show is a lot less busy than normal. At the hotel, a staff member saw my show badge and said, 'Wow, is CES still on?'""

Chip maker Piera Systems, developer of an air-quality sensor powered by a newly designed custom chip, believes it has the world's most accurate low-cost particle sensor to ensure clean air, says Piera CEO Vin Ratford. He told MarketWatch the Canadian company was to be part of an Ontario government pavilion at CES, until the provincial government pulled out of the show for health and safety reasons.

Meanwhile, 3Oe Scientific is demonstrating at CES a water-cooler-sized device called Iggy where users at schools, office buildings, factories and sports venues can insert their hands and have them sprayed with aqueous ozone to kill viruses and bacteria. The process takes seven seconds.

""It is reimaging how you wash hands,"" CEO Tom Foust told MarketWatch. The company is seeking FDA approval.

However, the safest option is attending the show virtually. For the first time, Web Summit has licensed its proprietary software, Summit Engine, to CES organizers so attendees can access keynote speeches, panels and video meetings at the show from the comfort of their laptops and smartphones. Indeed, the approach may be a harbinger for hybrid tech shows to come.

""The future of tech conferences is a bit of both: You can attend virtually and in person,"" Paddy Cosgrove, CEO of Web Summit, told MarketWatch via a Zoom ZM call. He had planned to go Las Vegas but considered it ""reckless"" to attend in person.

""CTA has made the best of a challenging situation,"" Cosgrove said. ""We noticed changes in user behavior during our [tech] show in November [in Portugal]. More people are attending shows virtually in the morning, then going in person for meetings. It is like work and most everything else these days.""

CTA CEO Gary Shapiro has steadfastly defended the decision to put on a mega-event in the teeth of a raging pandemic. In a Facebook message to this reporter last month, he offered various percentages on the unlikelihood of a CES attendee getting sick at the show if fully vaccinated.

The show, which was virtual a year ago, has taken several precautions, including requiring proof-of-vaccination cards and masks to attend indoor exhibits, socially-distanced venues, hand-sanitation stations and on-site testing.

Despite the in-person absence of nearly every major tech vendor, the show semi-kicked off Tuesday night with a keynote address by Jong-Hee (JH) Han, vice chairman and CEO of Samsung Electronics KR:005930, one of the few companies to have a physical presence at the show. Among those that aren't: Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGLGOOG, Meta Platforms Inc. FB, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, HP Inc. HPQ, Peloton Interactive Inc. PTON, BMW, Lenovo Group Ltd. HK:992, ATT Inc. T, Procter Gamble Co. PG, and Panasonic Corp. JP:6752.

Samsung Electronics did scale back its on-site contingent. A number of company representatives changed their travel plans at the last minute, and did not make the trip to CES.","{'uri': 'dr.marketwatch.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'dr.marketwatch.com'}",[],,-0.1058823529411764,,False,0,-0.1058823529411764,379047960,1

The San Diego, California, company once known for its mobile phone chips has created a range of automotive offerings, from self-driving car brains to chips that operate digital dashboards and infotainment systems. But the chips are all aimed at the same goal of helping automakers transform their vehicles into rolling computers that can be updated over the air with paid upgrades that generate revenue for carmakers long after a vehicle has left dealer lots, a business model pioneered by Tesla Inc.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm said it has reached a deal with Geely Holding-backed brands Volvo and Polestar to use Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon Cockpit"" chips and an operating system from Alphabet Inc's Google in vehicles starting later this year.

The deal will allow Volvo's electric SUV, which is to begin production this year, to tap into hands-free use of Google Assistant and navigation with Google Maps. The companies said that future upgrades will be sent out over the air.

Qualcomm also said that Honda will start using its ""cockpit"" chips in vehicles that will hit roads in 2023. Qualcomm also said Renault has agreed to use its automotive technology, but did not give specifics of which chips or when vehicles using them would arrive.

Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it has created a new chip and system for computer vision, which uses cameras on the car and artificial intelligence to help with safety functions like automatic lane control. The new ""Snapdragon Ride Vision System"" uses software from Arriver, which was part of Qualcomm's $4.5 billion purchase of automotive technology firm Veoneer Inc last year.","{'uri': 'auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ETAuto.com'}",[],"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-88701929,imgsize-53796,width-1200,height-628,overlay-etauto/qualcomm-inks-car-chip-deals-with-volvo-honda-and-renault.jpg",0.1215686274509804,,True,0,0.1215686274509804,379047900,5

Qualcomm announced that the collaboration will see the pair develop custom AR chips for both consumer and enterprise devices.

These custom AR chips will focus on ushering in an era of AR glasses that are lightweight and power-efficient as well as integrating into Microsoft's ecosystem. That'll mean support for software like Microsoft Mesh - Microsoft's shared mixed-reality (MR) platform - and the Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform.

What this could mean is a more lightweight, consumer-friendly version of Microsoft's HoloLens 2. A consumer edition was in fact confirmed last year by Microsoft's Alex Kipman who said: ""we are absolutely working on a consumer journey for HoloLens."" And then there was that Pokémon GO demo by Niantic Labs using the MR headset.

""This collaboration reflects the next step in both companies' shared commitment to XR and the metaverse,"" said Hugo Swart, vice president and general manager of XR, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. in a statement. ""Qualcomm Technologies' core XR strategy has always been delivering the most cutting-edge technology, purpose-built XR chipsets and enabling the ecosystem with our software platforms and hardware reference designs. We are thrilled to work with Microsoft to help expand and scale the adoption of AR hardware and software across the entire industry.""

""Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation,"" adds Rubén Caballero, corporate vice president Mixed Reality, Microsoft. ""With services like Microsoft Mesh, we are committed to delivering the safest and most comprehensive set of capabilities to power metaverses that blend the physical and digital worlds, ultimately delivering a shared sense of presence across devices. We look forward to working with Qualcomm Technologies to help the entire ecosystem unlock the promise of the metaverse.""

Qualcomm is heavily invested in the XR space with chipsets like its Snapdragon XR2 platform being used in devices like Meta Quest 2. And then there's the XR1 AR Smart Viewer Reference Design which OEM's can utilise to enter the AR glasses market. This, of course, all leads towards a metaverse vision that most tech companies seem to be scrambling towards.

Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday said it is working with Microsoft Corp on custom chips that would control lightweight augmented reality glasses for use by both consumers and businesses for metaverse apps.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said during a press conference that the two companies will work together to mate the custom chips with the software that developers need to create virtual worlds in which people can work and play.

He said that future devices from the collaboration will work with a Microsoft software product called Mesh that allows users to beam a realistic likeness of themselves into the headset of another user so that it feels like the two people are in the same room.

The future hardware will also use software from Qualcomm called Snapdragon Spaces that helps perform basic augmented reality functions like mapping out physical spaces so that digital objects can be overlaid on them and hand-tracking so that users can manipulate those digital objects with hand gestures.

""We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale,"" Amon, one of the few major tech executives not to cancel his physical presence at the trade show, said from a live-streamed talk on stage in Las Vegas.

The moves include a new computer vision processor called the Snapdragon Ride Vision System, which will deliver advanced driver assistance via onboard cameras beginning in 2024.

The San Diego company's new leading-edge chip will square off against Intel's Mobileye -- the dominant firm in machine vision technology used in cars. Mobileye announced its own new chip at CES to help enable autonomous driving in partnership with Volkswagen and Ford.

Qualcomm also unveiled digital cockpit/infotainment deals with Volvo, Honda and Renault to bring onboard connectivity, high-tech dashboards and entertainment systems to vehicle models, some of which are arriving this year.

""We are always going to be the company focused on mobile, but there is more to Qualcomm,"" Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said at a press conference at CES, previously known as the Consumer Electronics Show. ""Car companies, many of them now, are tech companies. Technology assets have become extremely important.""

Automakers have embraced technology not only to make vehicles safer but to potentially enable new revenue streams in the era of electric and autonomous cars. They include possible subscriptions for over-the-air software upgrades or paid onboard entertainment services as more screens are installed in vehicles.

Chip sales to automakers reached $1 billion last year for Qualcomm -- mostly from connectivity and infotainment systems. Auto revenue is forecast to climb to $3.5 billion annually in five years.

The company currently has a $13 billion order pipeline across its digital chassis portfolio for cars, which includes 4G/5G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, audio, rear-seat video and digital dashboards -- as well as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies.

BMW and General Motors are Qualcomm's cornerstone customers, but it sells to myriad other brands ranging from Hyundai to Audi, Chrysler to Lexus.

With the new Snapdragon Ride Vision System, Qualcomm isn't targeting full driverless capabilities known as Level 4 autonomy, at least for now.

Instead, it's steering toward driver assistance camera systems that help motorists behind the wheel without taking complete control. It aims to make technology flexible enough to be offered across all vehicle price ranges, said Amon, from luxury to entry level.

""When we think about ADAS, we think the real opportunity is to attach Level 2 and Level 3 to every car,"" said Amon. ""It can become as pervasive as anti-lock braking systems and airbags.

""We are working on full autonomy as well,"" he continued. ""We know that has more regulatory challenges and needs more time to mature. But the opportunity to do Level 2 and Level 3 as an assisted solution to the driver is real and is one that can really scale.""

Last year, Qualcomm joined with private firm SW Partners to acquire Swedish auto technology firm Veoneer for $4.5 billion. The complex deal calls for Qualcomm to retain Veoneer's Arriver autonomous driving software stack, while SW Partners will sell off the rest of Veoneer's remaining auto sensor businesses.

Arriver software is included in the Snapdragon Ride Vision System.

With Volvo, Qualcomm inked a deal to supply Snapdragon Cockpit technologies to infotainment systems in upcoming fully electric SUVs under the Volvo and Polestar brands.

The first vehicles are slated to hit the market later this year. Working with Google's Android automotive operating system, the SUVs will feature hands-free help from Google Assistant and navigation with Google Maps, among other things.

Honda will begin using Qualcomm's digital cockpit chips in models expected to hit the market in the second half of this year in the U.S. The technology will be available in Honda cars globally in 2023.

Renault Group also plans to plug in Qualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chassis technologies but didn't reveal when vehicles would be available.

Qualcomm's shares ended trading Tuesday up slightly at $187.23 on the Nasdaq exchange.","{'uri': 'sandiegouniontribune.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'San Diego Union-Tribune'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a0dd957/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2F28%2F99e85ae6403c943bcda3fe44b846%2Fsnapdragon-digital-cockpit.jpg,0.3019607843137255,eng-7383748,False,0.6980392336845398,0.3019607843137255,379045860,8

Unfortunately, as 2022 begins, Microsoft has not delivered the update.

According to Windows Central, the tech giant may skip the standard Android 12 release and go for Android 12L on the Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2.

Google recently announced a preview of Android 12L, which may sound like a new version of Android, but Google calls it ""a special feature drop that makes Android 12 even better on large screens"".

The idea here is to provide users on tablets, foldables and Chrome OS laptops -- anything with a screen above 600 dp -- with an improved user interface.

Coming back to Microsoft Surface Duo, it features two 5.6-inch OLED (1,350x1,800 pixels) displays with 4:3 aspect ratio that join together to provide an 8.1-inch PixelSense Fusion display with 2,700 x 1,800 pixels resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio.

Regarding the photographic section on the back, which is again signed by Hasselblad, we see a configuration of three cameras made up of 48 MP + 50 MP + 8 MP sensors. The frontal region, for its part, incorporates a sensor 32 MP for selfies. It is expected that in the coming days OnePlus will detail the capabilities of each sensor and other news related to the photography of the OnePlus 10 Pro.

In this range, consumers expect autonomy that, at least, lasts for a full day. On paper it seems that the OnePlus 10 Pro will be able to fulfill in this regard, since it has a 5,000 mAh battery. This is compatible with fast charging up to 80 W and wireless charging of up to 50 W. Regarding the software, the mobile will arrive with OxygenOS 12, the operating system based on Android 12.

To develop Pluton, Microsoft took its learnings from Xbox, where it has a number of physical attack protections in place, and has tried to bring in a similar level of protection to Windows PCs. Also Read - Motorola Moto G71 5G launch next week: Expected price in India, specs, and more

""Ryzen 6000 series will be the first PC processors that integrate the Microsoft Pluton security processor,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su during the company's CES 2022 keynote. ""Our co-development work with Microsoft eliminates entire attack vectors on notebooks, better protecting critical data like system credentials, user identities, encryption keys, and personal information,"" she added.

Pluton will be integrated with AMD's new Ryzen 6000 series processors, which will start showing up in upcoming laptops over the next few months from various OEMs. Apart from the integration of the Pluton chip, AMD has also announced that its new 6000 series Ryzen CPUs bring in up to 69 percent faster video editing, more than double the 3D rendering performance, and double the 1080p gaming performance in comparison to the 5000 gen Ryzen CPUs.

AMD Ryzen 6000 CPUs

The new AMD Ryzen 6000 CPUs are based on the company's upgraded Zen 3 Plus architecture and a new 6nm process node. Apart from this, they also bring in their new RDNA 2 graphics architecture for integrated GPUs. The company claims that the new CPUs will be able to deliver up to 1.3 times faster processing, up to two times the gaming performance of the previous generation, and up to 24 hours of battery life.

The new Ryzen 6000 CPUs will be offered in both an H-series line (for powerful devices) and a U-series line (for thin-and-light laptops).

AMD's RDNA 2 graphics architecture is used on next-gen consoles including the Xbox Series X|S, and the PlayStation 5. This bundled with the company's FidelityFX Super Resolution supersampling will provide a great gaming experience even on ultrathin category laptops according to the company.

Apart from the performance gains, AMD has also focussed on improving the power management of its chips, which according to the company enable a maximum of 24 hours of battery life. The new CPUs also come with support for USB4, DDR5, LPDDR5, PCIe Gen 4, HDMI 2.1, WiFi 6k and Bluetooth LE 5.2.

First laptops powered by the new AMD Ryzen 6000 chips will be announced at CES 2022 by major OEMs including Acer, Asus, Alienware, Lenovo, Razer, and HP. The company claims over 200 premium laptops powered by the new chips will launch in 2022, with the first devices set to ship next month.

Just yesterday, OnePlus revealed that the OnePlus 10 Pro will debut in China later this month, along with sharing a few official renders of what the device will look like. Now, the company is back again, stringing out the inevitable, as we now know what will be providing the power.

As expected the OnePlus 10 Pro will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, instantly making it a contender for one of the best Android phones, and will use LPDDR5 RAM along with UFS 3.1 storage. Unfortunately, we don't know how much RAM and storage will be available, but it's safe to assume we'll see a base configuration with 8GB and 128GB, respectively.

The display itself uses the second-generation LTPO technology, which helps to enable the 120Hz refresh rate with OnePlus' Fluid AMOLED screen. On the camera front, we have a 32MP selfie camera, hidden in the hole-punch cutout on the front. Moving to the back and the new camera module, there's a triple camera array headlined by a 48MP wide-angle lens. Accompanying this primary camera will be a 50MP sensor and a tertiary 8MP lens, likely using the same 50MP lens from the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro, along with an 8MP telephoto camera.","{'uri': 'androidcentral.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Central'}",[],https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2022/01/oneplus-10-pro-green-back.jpg,0.2862745098039217,eng-7384329,False,0.7764706015586853,0.2862745098039217,379042860,1

The partnership was announced at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show and will see Qualcomm work with Microsoft across several initiatives to drive the ecosystem. These initiatives include the development of custom AR chips and the integration of software such as Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces XR Development Platform.

With a focus on both companies being ""believers in the metaverse,"" the new custom AR chips will be designed to enable a new wave of power-efficient, lightweight AR glass that can deliver rich and immersive experiences. The partnership is said to recognize Qualcomm's proven spatial computing expertise, technology leadership and the desire to create immersive experiences for the next generation of head-worn AR devices.

""This collaboration reflects the next step in both companies' shared commitment to XR and the metaverse,"" Hugo Swart, vice president and general manager of XR at Qualcomm, said in a statement. ""Qualcomm Technologies' core XR strategy has always been delivering the most cutting-edge technology, purpose-built XR chipsets and enabling the ecosystem with our software platforms and hardware reference designs.""

Rubén Caballero, corporate vice president of Mixed Reality, Microsoft, said similarly, noting that ""our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation.""

Qualcomm and Microsoft have partnered in the past, including an alliance in 2018 to assist in catching up in the voice assistant market. Microsoft also features custom SQ1 and SQ2 chips, developed in conjunction with Qualcomm, in its ARM-based Surface Pro X and has worked with Qualcomm on developing ARM-based Windows PCs.

While still some way off entering the mainstream, interest in virtual reality and AR has continued to increase in the last year, with the likes of Meta Inc. embracing the metaverse as a core part of its future strategy.

Microsoft has form in the AR space through its HoloLens AR glasses. Microsoft has carved out a strong niche for the glasses in the commercial market, including contracts with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S. Army.","{'uri': 'siliconangle.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SiliconANGLE'}",[],https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2020/09/hololens-ignite.png,0.2941176470588236,eng-7383810,False,0.8313725590705872,0.2941176470588236,379042740,5

Today's information is an almost full spec sheet. Or at least, a sheet of nearly all of the important specifications that impact the performance of the phone. Most of it is exactly what we've been expecting for some time now, thanks to a number of leaks in the run up to launch.

The company will continue leaning on Hasselblad for its colour processing with its so-called ""Second-generation Hasselblad Camera for Mobile"". This is made up of three cameras.

It will feature a 48-megapixel, 50-megapixel and 8-megapixel camera (likely in wide, ultrawide and telephoto zoom focal lengths), with dual OIS. While not explicitly stated, that probably means the primary and telephoto zoom lenses are optically stabilised. The selfie camera is 32-megapixels.

Inside, there should be plenty of power and speed, driven primarily by the Snapdragon 8 Gen1 chipset, making it one of the first phones to use the latest flagship platform from Qualcomm.

It's joined by speedy LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage, and has an AMOLED display capable of up to 120Hz refresh rates which also features LTPO technology.

The 5,000mAh battery bumps up the capacity by 500mAh from previous generation OnePlus phones and - as is customary for the company - features super fast charging.

It's here we see one of the first pieces of evidence that confirms OnePlus and Oppo are being run as one company. Because rather than brand it 'Warp Charge', OnePlus lists it as '80W SuperVOOC'. The manufacturer is no longer rebadging it.

More importantly, the 80W wired charging should mean even faster speeds than the previous 65W version, which was already very quick. And it's joined this year by really fast 50W AirVOOC wireless charging.

For the wireless version, it's almost certainly going to require a proprietary charging stand and one that will be an optional extra, it won't come with the phone as standard.

As we already knew, it's reiterated that the phone will run OxygenOS 12 based on Android 12, with an interface and software features that closely resemble ColorOS 12.

Other than that, the last bit of information worth knowing is that the phone will be slightly smaller than the OnePlus 9 Pro. At 163 x 73.9 x 8.55mm, it's ever so slightly slimmer, narrower and shorter than the previous flagship.

We're only talking fractions of millimetres here, but it could be enough to make it feel a tad more nimble in the palm.

The OnePlus 10 Pro will launch in China on 11 January, at which point the company will fill in any gaps not yet revealed. That is if it doesn't do so before then.","{'uri': 'pocket-lint.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pocket-lint'}","[{'uri': 'cam_bunton@pocket-lint.com', 'name': 'Cam Bunton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/1200x630/assets/images/159529-phones-news-oneplus-10-pro-specs-image1-iqwcpwabol.jpg,0.1137254901960785,eng-7376935,False,0.6196078658103943,0.1137254901960785,379042440,1

OnePlus today released a basic spec sheet for its upcoming OnePlus 10 Pro phone, confirming most of the rumored specs in the new Android flagship.

As expected, the new phone will use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, with a 120Hz LTPO AMOLED screen. The main cameras will be 48MP, 50MP and 8MP, the same as on the OnePlus 9 Pro, and the front camera will be 32MP.

The phone's 5,000mAh battery will charge at 80W wired or 50W wireless. Both charging methods use parent brand Oppo's VOOC system.

Size wise, the phone is almost exactly the same size as the OnePlus 9 Pro, but a tiny bit slimmer at 8.55mm versus 8.7mm. As you can see from the diagram below, this is a big phone. Although it isn't quite as large as the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, it's considerably bigger than the iPhone 13 or Samsung Galaxy S21.

""There may be slight changes in select specs depending on regional availability, which will be shared upon official launch of global variants,"" OnePlus said.

In American English, that means the T-Mobile variant will almost certainly be single SIM where the international models are dual SIM, and some of the 5G band support will be different across models. There's no word from OnePlus about whether there will be a smaller or lower-cost OnePlus 10 phone.

The OnePlus 10 Pro series is expected to launch in China on January 11, and will include a regular OnePlus 10 variant as well. Meanwhile, OnePlus is preparing to bring the OnePlus 9RT to the Indian market on January 14. Here's a look at the detailed specifications of the OnePlus 10 Pro.

The OnePlus 10 Pro sports a new design, with the company using a mirrored ceramic and frosted matte glass to create the phone's back. The camera module's design is different compared to the previous version, though it has the Hasselblad logo at the back. It will come in Volcanic Black and Emerald Forest (green) colour options. The phone comes with the second-generation Hasselblad camera. OnePlus had introduced the partnership with Hasselblad with the 9 Pro series.

The OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch QHD+ resolution display. This is a 120 Hz Fluid AMOLED screen with OnePlus using LTPO 2.0 panel. LTPO stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide and this kind of display ensures a smoother user experience when scrolling, without draining the battery life.

The phone runs the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, which was already confirmed by the company. It comes with 8GB and 12GB RAM variants with 128GB, 256GB storage options. The phone comes with UFS 3.1 storage which will ensure faster read and write speeds.

The phone has a triple camera at the back, with OnePlus using a 48MP and 50MP camera along with an 8MP telephoto camera. The phone comes with dual optical image stablisation. The front camera is 32MP. The phone runs OxygenOS 12 based on Android 12.

The other big change is around the battery. The phone now has a 5000 mAh battery compared to the 4500 mAh on the previous OnePlus 9 Pro. It also comes with 80W SuperVOOC fast charging and 50W AirVOOC wireless charing. It also supports reverse wireless charging, meaning you can place another compatible device on it and use the OnePlus device to charge it. VOOC is the proprietary charging technology by Oppo, which is OnePlus' parent company.

The phone comes with Dual Stereo Speakers, NFCs support, and Bluetooth 5.2 as well.","{'uri': 'indianexpress.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}",[],https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/01/OnePlus10_green1_1.jpg,0.05098039215686279,eng-7384329,False,0.8705882430076599,0.05098039215686279,379042200,1

We did see that bit coming, as OnePlus (along with parent company, Oppo) was among the first batch of partners listed -- though fellow Chinese device maker Xiaomi beat the company to the punch by announcing the first handset to support the chip.

That also means we're going to have to wait a bit for other key pieces of information -- North American availability being a pretty key one.

Following several credible-looking leaks, we now know straight from the source that the OnePlus 10 Pro will be among the first round of devices to sport Qualcomm's latest flagship processor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. This is the rebranded successor to last year's 888. We did see that bit coming, as OnePlus (along with parent company, Oppo) was among the first batch of partners listed -- though fellow Chinese device maker Xiaomi beat the company to the punch by announcing the first handset to support the chip.

The system runs Android 12-based OxygenOS, which the company has recently combined with Oppo's ColorOS, which it's thus far shown off as beta. The display sports a 120Hz refresh rate and the rear triple-camera system sports 48, 50 and eight-megapixel lenses. More specifics on the breakdown of the camera system are likely coming in some future update. The system sports a beefy 5,000mAh battery and 80W wired/ 50W wireless charging. More info soon.","{'uri': 'focustechnica.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'FocusTechnica'}",[],https://i2.wp.com/www.focustechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/OnePlus-10-Pro_Green-Headshot.jpg?fit=1173%2C880&ssl=1&w=640,0.2,eng-7376935,False,0.4666666686534882,0.2,379041240,1

Official product news about the upcoming OnePlus 10 Pro has begun to trickle out. For now, we have an incomplete overview with some pictures and specs, while things like a price, release date, and the finer details will have to wait for later.

First up: specs. OnePlus 10 Pro officially has the brand-new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC. This is Qualcomm's new flagship SoC for 2022, and it features a single ARM Cortex X2 core, three medium Cortex A710 CPUs, and four small Cortex A510 CPUs, all built on a 4 nm process. OnePlus isn't saying how much RAM and storage the 10 Pro has, but the 9 Pro came with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage. The company confirmed the display is 120 Hz but didn't give a size, though rumors say it's 6.7-inch, the same as the OnePlus 9 Pro. That fits the now-official dimensions, which are 163 × 73.9 × 8.55 mm.

The battery is officially 5000 mAh, an upgrade over the 9 Pro's 4500 mAh battery. Considering the similar dimensions between the two phones, this is a welcome upgrade in battery density. OnePlus is also up to a whopping 80 W ""SuperVOOC"" quick charging now -- an improvement over last year's 65 W ""Warp Charge."" OnePlus doesn't give any indication of what kind of charge time we can expect, but 65 W could charge the 9 Pro's 4500 mAh battery from 0-100 in a half-hour. Charging speed is still outpacing battery growth, so the 10 Pro should charge in under a half-hour. Just like last year, wireless charging is 50 W.

OnePlus has pitched itself as a scrappy startup in the past, but it's actually owned by the Chinese company BBK Electronics, one of the world's largest smartphone manufacturers. Just like General Motors, BBK has multiple brands (OnePlus, Oppo, Vivo, Realme, and iQOO) targeting different markets, and they share plenty of parts and engineering. While OnePlus and Oppo have always shared some engineering resources, last year it was announced OnePlus would actually be folded into Oppo.

The Oppoization of OnePlus is going to be a major narrative for the OnePlus 10 Pro. We can already see a bit of it with the change from ""Warp Charging"" (OnePlus branding) to ""SuperVOOC"" (Oppo branding). But what really matters is the software, which will see OnePlus adopt Oppo's Color OS Android skin with a few custom tweaks rather than the separate codebases the two companies were running. We got a glimpse of this design direction via the OnePlus 9's Android 12 update, and the reviews were not kind. But we'll see what the first new phone software brings.

As for the design, the camera block is really the only area where Android OEMs allow themselves to differentiate from the norm. This year, OnePlus is going with this square-ish design that wraps around the side of the phone. It looks a lot like the Galaxy S21 Ultra camera block, except that it's wrapped around the entire corner. Inside the camera block are three cameras and an LED flash. Right now, OnePlus is only disclosing megapixel counts, and those are 48MP, 50MP, and 8MP.

We don't actually have a picture of the front yet, so above is OnLeak's unofficial render from a few months ago. This has the camera hole on the left side instead of the middle. Other than that, it looks like every other Android phone on the market.

It might be because of Oppo's influence, but OnePlus' launch is all sorts of weird this year. The phone is launching in China first on January 11. We don't have a price yet, but OnePlus' flagship prices have gone up every year so far, and the 9 Pro was $969. There's also no word on a US release date yet.","{'uri': 'arstechnica.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Ars Technica'}","[{'uri': 'ron_amadeo@arstechnica.com', 'name': 'Ron Amadeo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/scene00089-760x380.png,0.05882352941176472,eng-7376935,False,0.8156862854957581,0.05882352941176472,379041180,2

First, it released an official teaser image that revealed the design of the phone alongside a China release date of January 11th. Now, it's announcing the phone's specs, which include the newest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, ultra fast charging, and a 5,000mAh battery.

If you've been keeping up on Android news the past few months, none of these details will come as a surprise. Flagship Android phones in the US all tend to feature Qualcomm's most powerful processor and if there's any interesting news here, it's that OnePlus is getting a small jump on Samsung and becoming the first major smartphone to use the new chip.

The rest of the specs are exactly what you'd probably expect. Though, unfortunately, OnePlus is still leaving out a few key details like the amount of RAM on each model, prices, precise screen sizes, and release dates outside of China. In any case, here are a few of the specs it's revealing today:

There are a few things to note in that list. Along with picking up Oppo's operating system, the OnePlus 10 is also using Oppo's branding for its fast-charging system. Until now OnePlus had the same system but used its own Warp Charge brand. Branding aside, the rated speeds are still ridiculously fast. The dimensions also tell us that the OnePlus 10 Pro is a very large phone, nearly the size of a Galaxy S21 Ultra.

As with any Android phone these days, there have been plenty of rumors to fill in the gaps. We're expecting RAM options to either be 8GB or 12GB, with 128GB or 256GB of storage. As for the rest of the details, including a rumored April release, we'll need to wait for OnePlus to provide more details in its next announcement -- or the one after that.

Why do companies like OnePlus and Google space out the details on their new phones instead of giving us a single announcement? Your guess is as good as ours, but the obvious one is probably the right one: it gives them multiple bites at the Apple.","{'uri': 'theverge.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Verge'}","[{'uri': 'dieter_bohn@theverge.com', 'name': 'Dieter Bohn', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzAaw3h0IjRdAutpVQXizxe2EaA=/0x563:6750x3938/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119986/OnePlus_10_Pro.jpg,0.09019607843137245,eng-7376935,False,0.7058823704719543,0.09019607843137245,379041060,1

We'll be updating this article as we hunt down more details, so be sure to check back.

The OnePlus 10 Pro is rumored to have a 6.7-inch QHD Plus display, along with a slew of confirmed incremental upgrades ranging from faster wired charging speeds (80 watts), a larger battery (5,000mAh) and an upgraded processor in the form of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which promises faster graphics rendering and improved power efficiency.

Moving beyond the specs sheet, however, OnePlus revamped the rear camera bump, marking a noteworthy departure from the OnePlus 9 series toward something more Samsung-esque.

The Chinese phone maker confirmed this new bump will house three lenses: a 48-megapixel, a 50-megapixel and an 8-megapixel, but didn't share any other details yet. Rumors point to a main wide camera, an ultra-wide as well as telephoto lens.

Speaking of design changes, the glossy finishes seen in the OnePlus 9 series are now a thing of the past. OnePlus opted for a more understated matte finish, available in green or black, which is offset somewhat by the prominent Hasselblad branding on the camera bump. On the software front, it'll run on OxygenOS 12, which is based on Android 12. OnePlus founder Pete Lau said last year that its 2022 flagship phone would have a combined operating system merging OnePlus' OxygenOS with Oppo's ColorOS, providing a unified codebase for both phone brands.

For more information on how the OnePlus 10 Pro compares with its predecessors, take a look at CNET's specs chart below.","{'uri': 'cnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNET'}","[{'uri': 'sareena_dayaram@cnet.com', 'name': 'Sareena Dayaram', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/5C6IB1pzLZ5SNBQcww5ClpVyVr4=/1200x630/2022/01/04/6bd2a578-2aca-4cbc-ad87-e97b9aa7a6ba/oneplus-10-pro-green-whole-phone.jpg,0.1450980392156862,eng-7376935,False,0.7803921699523926,0.1450980392156862,379041060,1

As has been rumored, there will be a triple rear camera setup, including 48-, 50-and 8-megapixel lenses. A 32-megapixel lens will be on the front for selfies and video chats.

The OnePlus 9 Pro had a similar rear camera setup with the 48-megapixel shooter functioning as the main lens, the 50-megapixel as an ultra-wide and an 8-megapixel telephoto, though the company would not confirm that the arrangement will remain on the 10 Pro.

Hasselblad remains involved in the imaging system, though what kind of improvements this might bring also remains unknown.

OnePlus has yet to confirm the phone's display size or resolution, though rumors suggest it will remain at 6.7 inches. The company confirmed on Tuesday that it will have a 120Hz refresh rate.

As for charging, the phone will support 80-watt wired fast charging and 50-watt wireless charging using OnePlus' respective SuperVOOC and AirVOOC accessories. The OnePlus 9 Pro supported 50-watt fast wireless charging, but its wired charging was capped at 65 watts, which brought its smaller 4,500-mAh battery from 1% to 100% in 29 minutes.

There will also be reverse wireless charging, but as with so many other aspects of this device, its speed remains a mystery. Pricing for the phone isn't known, either.

With the phone going on sale in China in a week, however, it seems like these details are destined to be revealed soon. OnePlus has said it plans to bring the phone to the US and other markets later in the year.","{'uri': 'cnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNET'}","[{'uri': 'eli_blumenthal@cnet.com', 'name': 'Eli Blumenthal', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/5C6IB1pzLZ5SNBQcww5ClpVyVr4=/1200x630/2022/01/04/6bd2a578-2aca-4cbc-ad87-e97b9aa7a6ba/oneplus-10-pro-green-whole-phone.jpg,0.1058823529411765,eng-7376935,False,0.7176470756530762,0.1058823529411765,379040940,1

OnePlus' strategy for the phone seems to be developing into an information drip-feed, as the launch event isn't until January 11, giving it plenty more time to send out more snippets about it in the meantime.

For now, though, we've got the chance to go over the general specifications of the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G, starting with the camera. OnePlus calls it the ""second-generation Hasselblad Camera for mobile,"" giving us plenty of hope it has worked with the iconic camera maker on both the software and the hardware this time. There are three cameras, a 48-megapixel, a 50MP, and an 8MP, and at least one will come with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). Somewhere around the screen will be a 32MP selfie camera.

On the subject of the screen, we haven't seen the front of the phone and OnePlus has not stated the screen size yet either, but does say it will be a Fluid AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, up from the 90Hz on the OnePlus 9 Pro. OnePlus has fitted the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor with an unspecified amount of LPDDR5 RAM, plus a 5,000mAh battery to the phone. The old Warp Charge name given to OnePlus's proprietary charging technology has been dropped in favor of Oppo's SuperVOOC fast charging, which will run at 80W. There's also 50W AirVOOC wireless fast charging and reverse charging too.

What else? The software will be OxygenOS 12 based on Android 12, there are dual stereo speakers, NFC for mobile payments, and Bluetooth 5.2. The dimensions of the phone give us an idea of how big the device will be, and it appears to be almost exactly the same as the OnePlus 9 Pro, apart from being a very tiny bit slimmer. It's so tiny -- 8.55mm compared to 8.7mm -- that you probably won't even notice.

While it's great to learn more official details about the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G, what we don't know is when it'll be available. It appears the phone will launch in China first, which is where the event will take place on January 11, and an international launch will presumably come later on. Exactly when is a mystery. Perhaps it will be part of any further information OnePlus decides to reveal before the big day itself?

As expected, the new phone will use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, with a 120Hz LTPO AMOLED screen. The main cameras will be 48MP, 50MP and 8MP, the same as on the OnePlus 9 Pro, and the front camera will be 32MP.

The phone's 5,000mAh battery will charge at 80W wired or 50W wireless. Both charging methods use parent brand Oppo's VOOC system.

Size wise, the phone is almost exactly the same size as the OnePlus 9 Pro, but a tiny bit slimmer at 8.55mm versus 8.7mm. As you can see from the diagram below, this is a big phone. Although it isn't quite as large as the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, it's considerably bigger than the iPhone 13 or Samsung Galaxy S21.

""There may be slight changes in select specs depending on regional availability, which will be shared upon official launch of global variants,"" OnePlus said.

In American English, that means the T-Mobile variant will almost certainly be single SIM where the international models are dual SIM, and some of the 5G band support will be different across models. There's no word from OnePlus about whether there will be a smaller or lower-cost OnePlus 10 phone.

In typical OnePlus fashion, the brand that ""Never Settles"" is teasing its upcoming flagship with a list of specs confirming much of what we expected from the OnePlus 10 series.

Due to a staggered launch across the globe, China will see the OnePlus 10 Pro first, and given the spec sheet, it looks to continue the legacy of previous flagship devices. For starters, the device will measure in at 163 x 73.9 x 8.55mm with the device, including a 6.67-inch 120Hz LPTO AMOLED display. The internals include the usage of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, LPDDR5 RAM, and UFS 3.1 storage alongside a number of other key additions.

Of those, the most notable spec bumps to the OnePlus 10 Pro will include the usage of a 5,000mAh battery with 80W fast charging and 50W wireless charging via compatible accessories. Reverse wireless charging will be included, but OnePlus has not noted the speeds.

The high-profile partnership with Hasselblad continues with the OnePlus 10 Pro's wrap-around camera laden with the Swedish camera manufacturer's branding. The camera specs include a 32-megapixel selfie camera and, at the rear, a 48-megapixel main sensor, 50-megapixel secondary sensor, and 8-megapixel tertiary sensor.

It comes as no surprise to see that the spec sheet for the OnePlus 10 Pro notes that it will launch with OxygenOS based upon Android 12 pre-installed. For those unaware, this version of OxygenOS is the first stable release to be based upon Oppo's ColorOS. This polarizing change has been made to improve the update process, and the merging of the Oppo and OnePlus development teams will supposedly be a catalyst for increased OTA regularity.

Beyond the specs, we know that the OnePlus 10 Pro will launch on January 11 in China and likely later in global regions. It will be available in a matte black and an alpine green option.

The company also revealed that the phone will launch in China starting on January 11th before making its way to more regions. However, we are just now learning about what the phone will offer in terms of specs and power.

OnePlus 10 Pro Specs Display: 6.7-inches / LTPO 2.0 Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 RAM: 8GB / 12GB Storage: 128GB / 256GB UFS 3.1 Front Camera: 32MP Rear Cameras: 48MP + 50MP + 8MP Battery: 5,000mAh w/ 80W SuperVOOC wired charging + 50W AirVOOC Wireless Charging Software: OxygenOS 12 based on Android 12 Dimensions: 163 x 73.9 x 8.55mm Extras: 120Hz Refresh Rate / Bluetooth 5.2 / NFC / Reverse Wireless Charging / Dual Stereo Speakers

As expected, the OnePlus 10 Pro comes in with a 6.7-inch display making use of LTPO 2.0 technology. With it, we have an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate, but this will be more efficient than the LTPO displays that are currently found in the Android space.

Powering the handset is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, which will offer more power and better efficiency than last year's Snapdragon 888. Paired with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is either 8GB or 12GB of RAM and up to 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage.

On the front, OnePlus is using a solid 32MP selfie camera, nestled in a hole-punch cutout. The 10 Pro marks the latest phone to get some love from the company's partnership with Hasselblad, using a triple camera setup. This is headlined by a 48MP wide-angle lens and is accompanied by a 50MP ultra-wide camera and an 8MP telephoto sensor.

Battery life should be pretty great considering that OnePlus is packing a 5,000mAh cell into the 10 Pro. This, paired with the 80W SuperVOOC wired charging speeds, should get your phone back up to 100% in no time. OnePlus is also bringing back its fast wireless charging, reaching speeds up to 50W, provided that you are using the correct charger. And for those times when you need to juice up your earbuds, reverse wireless charging is available.

Another obvious inclusion here is that the OnePlus 10 Pro is running OxygenOS 12, which is based on Android 12. The 10 Pro is the company's first phone to be released with Android 12 in tow. Hopefully, this means we won't have as many bugs to deal with as were found when the update began rolling out to OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro owners at the end of 2021.

OnePlus has still yet to provide pricing information, but we'll be sure to update this post once it is made available.","{'uri': 'phandroid.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Phandroid - Android News and Reviews'}",[],https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/oneplus-10-pro-2-640x585.jpg,0.1843137254901961,eng-7376935,False,0.6901960968971252,0.1843137254901961,379040760,2

Linksys shares specifications below.

The Hydra Pro 6 (MR5500) Dual-Band AX5400 Mesh Wi-Fi 6 Router can be pre-ordered from Linksys directly here now. The company says the router should begin shipping in just a couple days, so thankfully, you won't have to wait long. Unfortunately, there does seem to be a big downside to the MR5500 -- the price. You see, Linksys is asking $299.99 which does seem a bit high compared to other offerings on the market. However, if you have affinity for the Linksys name, it may be worth the premium.","{'uri': 'betanews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'BetaNews'}","[{'uri': 'brian_fagioli@betanews.com', 'name': 'Brian Fagioli', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Hydra-Pro-6_-Lifestyle2.jpg?w=640,0.2862745098039217,eng-7383175,False,0.8941176533699036,0.2862745098039217,379040760,1

But when the latest OnePlus flagship does reach other markets, it figures to be the fastest-charging phone we've ever seen.

OnePlus continues to parse out information about the OnePlus 10 Pro in advance of the phone's January 11 debut in China, with the latest announcement confirming most, if not all, of the device's specs. Among the highlights is the phone's charging speed. You'll be able to enjoy 80W charging speeds for the OnePlus 10 Pro with a wired connection; the phone can charge up to 50W wirelessly.

We thought we had seen fast charging with previous OnePlus phones, ever since OnePlus introduced its 65W Warp Charge feature with 2020's OnePlus 8T. To give you an idea of how fast a phone can charge with a 65W charger, a drained OnePlus 9 Pro was able to get a 99% charge after 30 minutes when we tested that phone last year. Presumably, the 80W wired charging will help the OnePlus 10 Pro power up even faster.

The OnePlus 10 Pro will need that fast charging to quickly fill up its larger battery. OnePlus' new phone features a 5,000 mAh power pack, a step up from the 4,500 mAh battery that powered the OnePlus 9 Pro.

Here are the other key OnePlus 10 Pro specs revealed by OnePlus.

Cameras are a big deal for any phone, but especially OnePlus' flagship, where cameras had been the phone maker's Achilles' heel. That changed in a big way with the OnePlus 9 series, as OnePlus teamed up with Swedish lens specialist Hasselblad to dramatically improve the image quality of the pictures the OnePlus 9 models captured.

We already knew Hasselblad was remaining in the fold when OnePlus published photos showing off the OnePlus 10 Pro design that included Hasselblad branding on the camera array. The specs sheet released by OnePlus also notes that the new phone will feature the second-generation Hasselblad camera for mobile as its imaging system.

The OnePlus 10 Pro's basic camera specs look to be unchanged from the OnePlus 9 Pro, as the new phone will retain a 48MP main camera, 50MP ultrawide shooter and 8MP telephoto lens. The monochrome lens included on the OnePlus 9 Pro is a goner, and that's no big loss, as we found that to be a superfluous addition.

OnePlus didn't specify if the apertures are changing on its three rear lenses or if the telephoto lens will offer the same 3.3x optical zoom found on the OnePlus 9 Pro. We're also hoping to hear more details about specific features Hasselblad is bringing to the OnePlus 10 Pro, after the Swedish firm helped OnePlus improve color accuracy with last year's camera phones.

Up front, the OnePlus 10 Pro will offer a 32MP camera -- a boost from the 16MP selfie cam on the OnePlus 9 Pro.

OnePlus didn't mention the screen size for the OnePlus 10 Pro, but we can make a pretty good guess as to what it'll be. The new flagship will measure 6.4 x 2.9 x 0.34 inches, which matches the dimensions of the OnePlus 9 Pro. That's a pretty good indicator that a 6.7-inch screen will be featured on this new phone, too.

But the OnePlus 10 Pro's screen will be slightly different from the one on last year's flagship. As before, OnePlus plans to use an AMOLED panel with an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate. But OnePlus says the OnePlus 10 Pro will use second-generation LTPO calibration for its display, otherwise known as LTPO 2.0. OnePlus CEO and co-founder Pete Lau had promised as much back in December.

LTPO 2.0 is an updated version of the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide that enables displays to vary their refresh rate depending on what's happening on the screen. (Activities like scrolling get a faster refresh rate, while more static activities drop down the refresh rate to preserve battery life.) LTPO 2.0 supposedly offers smoother transitions, though we'll have to wait and see first-hand if that improves the overall experience.

We already knew that the OnePlus 10 Pro was going to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, thanks to images from OnePlus' teaser announcement. But now the news is even more official. Qualcomm's latest system-on-chip promises a 20% faster CPU with a 30% improvement to power efficiency; the GPU should be 30% faster as well. Other highlights include an improved image signal processor, AI engine advancements and features aimed at delivering more console-like gaming graphics.

OnePlus didn't list RAM and storage numbers, only saying that the phone would offer LPDDR5 memory and UFS 3.1 storage. The OnePlus 10 Pro will run Android 12 via the latest version of the phone maker's Oxygen OS, and the device will sport dual stereo speakers.","{'uri': 'tomsguide.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': ""Tom's Guide""}","[{'uri': 'philip_michaels@tomsguide.com', 'name': 'Philip Michaels', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdq7nEcwkgRChwLAXFeBK7-1200-80.jpg,0.06666666666666665,eng-7376935,False,0.9098039269447327,0.06666666666666665,379040700,1

Following the official reveal of the OnePlus 10 Pro, the company has now released details about the OnePlus 10 Pro specs. There really aren't a lot of surprises in the specs revealed here. As the first new phone from the company this year, we kind of expected them to go big, and that's exactly what they're doing. The new smartphone will feature Hasselblad Camera tech for starters. Additionally, you can expect it to sport the latest mobile processor from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.

Rumors about the OnePlus 10 Pro have been swirling for several weeks now. Anyone that called the new device featuring a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 can give themselves a firm pat on the back. Outside of the processor, though, OnePlus has also confirmed that the OnePlus 10 Pro will feature a 5,000 mAh battery, support for Bluetooth 5.2, and a triple-camera setup.

While the company already revealed images showing off the three-camera setup, the official OnePlus 10 Pro specs reveal gives us more detailed info about those three cameras. First, the camera is made up of a 48MP, 50MP, and 8MP camera system. The imaging system itself is second-generation Hasselblad Camera for Mobile tech.

On the display front, the OnePlus 10 Pro will sport a 120Hz Fluid Amoled display with LTPO. LTPO stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. Essentially, the display should allow for better power usage and variable refresh rates. Former leaks said that the OnePlus 10 Pro would utilize LTPO 2.0 tech, so it isn't all that surprising to see that expectation come true.

OnePlus also revealed that the OnePlus 10 Pro will feature support for 80W wired charging. It will also offer up to 50W wireless charging. It also supports reverse wireless charging, too. On the front of the phone, the device will sport a 32MP front camera. This should allow for some high-resolution selfies, if you're into that kind of thing. OnePlus also noted that the phone will feature LPDDR5 + UFS 3.1 RAM and storage. At the time of the specs reveal, no exact RAM or storage options were shared.

While the OnePlus 10 Pro specs reveal does give us a bit more information about the device, there's still a good bit we aren't aware of just yet. For instance, we know that the device will launch on January 11 in China. However, OnePlus hasn't shared any details regarding a global launch for the device. Because it's one of the company's primary lineups, many expect it to have a western release somewhere down the line. OnePlus also hasn't revealed a price point yet, so we'll have to wait for more info on that front, too.

With that release date approaching, many expect OnePlus will begin sharing more details about the OnePlus 10 Pro very soon. For now, though, we can sit back and marinate on these OnePlus 10 Pro specs for a bit. After all, the new device is shaping up to look like quite a catch for fans of the brand.","{'uri': 'bgr.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'BGR'}","[{'uri': 'joshua_hawkins@bgr.com', 'name': 'Joshua Hawkins', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/OnePlus-10-Pro_Green-Headshot-e1641317753641.jpg?quality=82&strip=all,0.01960784313725483,eng-7376935,False,0.8392156958580017,0.01960784313725483,379040460,1

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said during a press conference that the two companies will work together to mate the custom chips with the software that developers need to create virtual worlds in which people can work and play.

He said that future devices from the collaboration will work with a Microsoft software product called Mesh that allows users to beam a realistic likeness of themselves into the headset of another user so that it feels like the two people are in the same room.

The future hardware will also use software from Qualcomm called Snapdragon Spaces that helps perform basic augmented reality functions like mapping out physical spaces so that digital objects can be overlaid on them and hand-tracking so that users can manipulate those digital objects with hand gestures.

""We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale,"" Amon, one of the few major tech executives not to cancel his physical presence at the trade show, said from a live-streamed talk on stage in Las Vegas.

The two companies did not give details about when the chips and headsets would be available.

""Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future - a future that is grounded in trust and innovation,"" Rubén Caballero, corporate vice president for mixed reality at Microsoft, said in a statement.

Intel, clinging to its title of world's largest chipmaker by revenue, showed off graphics chips aimed at fighting Nvidia and AMD in their area of domination. Nvidia's latest chips are targeted at persuading more laptop owners to choose its highly specialized graphics capabilities, and AMD touted products meant to maintain its market share gains.

Qualcomm, the biggest maker of mobile-phone chips, bolstered its push to win a chunk of the personal-computer market, leveraging its strength in smartphone technology.

The flurry of announcements at the annual CES technology conference, based in Las Vegas but mostly taking place virtually, highlights the shifting competitive landscape for the group of companies whose technology rules the computer and mobile-phone industries. Intel's loss of leadership in chip-manufacturing technology has exposed it to challenges from newly confident rivals in the PC market. The company's response under Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger is to defend that market and, at the same time, to chase sales in its rivals' strongest businesses.

That fight will probably play out beyond 2022, with most analysts predicting Intel will struggle to boost sales this year, compared with revenue gains forecast for the other companies.

In an online presentation earlier in the day, Intel announced its 12th generation Core mobile processors, including 28 new models that are as much as 40% faster than their predecessors. Crucially, it also said new Arc graphics chips are being shipped to PC makers, including Acer Inc., Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc., which will use them in upcoming machines aimed at gamers.

The Arc chips are Intel's attempt to cut into the dominance of Nvidia and AMD in high-end graphics. More laptops are using add-in graphics cards to bolster capabilities in gaming and content creation, which are increasingly determining customer preferences. Intel's chips in the past have only offered graphics built into main microprocessors, typically with less power to generate realistic images.

Nvidia countered by unveiling new graphics chips for laptops, aimed at bringing high-end gaming and artificial intelligence capabilities to the thinnest and lightest computers.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics processor will equip notebooks that will be priced starting at $2,499, giving them better capabilities than many previous high-end desktop models, Nvidia said Tuesday in a virtual presentation. Laptop models running on the 3070 Ti chip will start at $1,499.

Nvidia, whose market value is larger than any other chipmaker, is rolling out new products as it works to broaden the reach of its technology into the laptop market. Most thin computers contain what's called integrated graphics, capabilities typically built into central processors from Intel or AMD.

Also as part of CES, AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su showed off new laptop and graphics processors meant to continue the company's run of stealing market share from Intel. AMD's graphics chips have come closer in performance to Nvidia's, but the larger company still controls the majority of the market for add-in cards for PC gamers that can cost more than $1,000.

And in one of the few remaining in-person appearances at CES, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke about his commitment to bringing smartphone technology-based processors to the PC market. He listed customers such as Microsoft Corp., Acer and Lenovo.

Qualcomm's chief also talked up his push into automotive semiconductors, unveiling chips that will help cars pilot themselves. That move will put him in more direct competition with Intel's Mobileye unit and Nvidia, which is also working to make chips to be the brains of vehicles of the future.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/278c54c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2160+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F18%2Fc9%2F4a5310144e6987a32976b42b9c57%2Fqualcomm-iot-chip.jpg,0.2392156862745098,eng-7383643,False,0.843137264251709,0.2392156862745098,379038720,3

The San Diego, California, company once known for its mobile phone chips has created a range of automotive offerings, from self-driving car brains to chips that operate digital dashboards and infotainment systems. But the chips are all aimed at the same goal of helping automakers transform their vehicles into rolling computers that can be updated over the air with paid upgrades that generate revenue for carmakers long after a vehicle has left dealer lots, a business model pioneered by Tesla Inc.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm said it has reached a deal with Geely Holding-backed brands Volvo and Polestar to use Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon Cockpit"" chips and an operating system from Alphabet Inc's Google in vehicles starting later this year.

The deal will allow Volvo's electric SUV, which is to begin production this year, to tap into hands-free use of Google Assistant and navigation with Google Maps. The companies said that future upgrades will be sent out over the air.

Qualcomm also said that Honda will start using its ""cockpit"" chips in vehicles that will hit roads in 2023. Qualcomm also said Renault has agreed to use its automotive technology, but did not give specifics of which chips or when vehicles using them would arrive.

Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it has created a new chip and system for computer vision, which uses cameras on the car and artificial intelligence to help with safety functions like automatic lane control. The new ""Snapdragon Ride Vision System"" uses software from Arriver, which was part of Qualcomm's $4.5 billion purchase of automotive technology firm Veoneer Inc last year.

But the real driver behind the surge has been the market's realization that the company has a huge runway ahead of it.

At an upbeat meeting with analysts in New York late last year, Qualcomm (ticker: QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon made the case that the company had line of sight to expand the market it can address from about $100 billion currently to $700 billion a few years from now. The company is a well-positioned play on multiple emerging trends, including connected cars, the metaverse, edge computing, wireless fiber, and a new generation of communications-centric laptops.

In an interview with Barron's on Tuesday at the CES tech trade show, just after addressing a standing-room-only crowd at a press conference, Amon discussed some of the reasons he is bullish about the long-term outlook. Qualcomm is playing a central role in the discussion at CES around connected and autonomous cars, , the company made announcements on new partnerships with Honda, Volvo and Renault. Yet there are other emerging story lines, some not fully appreciated by the market.

The company sees a growing opportunity in PCs. During the press conference, Amon highlighted growing adoption of Qualcomm's ARM-based Snapdragon processors for Windows-based PCs, noting agreements by companies like HP Inc. (HPQ), Acer, Asus, and Lenovo to use the chips in some devices. Amon won't directly say that the chips pose a threat to PC incumbents Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), but instead says that Qualcomm is ""focused on the next generation of laptops which take full advantage of mobile technologies.""

Amon says Qualcomm isn't building its PC chip business to compete against the incumbents. ""We can build next generation PCs,"" he says. ""What we've seen over the last two years is that PCs have become communications devices first ...the more you have cloud-based services on your PC, the more it points to Qualcomm's strengths."" What he implies, but didn't say directly, is that always-on laptops connected to 5G networks would play to Qualcomm's strengths, and boosts their competitive position versus the incumbents.

The prospects are improving for wireless fiber. Qualcomm announced a new deal with AT&T to offer wireless fiber as an option for direct connection to the network for consumers, in particular for speedy millimeter-wave 5G service. He thinks that 5G can become a ""universal last mile technology.""

""Resistance is futile,"" Amon says. ""5G will be everywhere."" The idea here is that with 5G, wireless can eventually supplant conventional home networks for many applications.

Amon is a believer in the metaverse. The CEO notes that Qualcomm has long been bullish on the opportunity here; Snapdragon processors power the Meta Quest 2 VR headsets, for instance. But he thinks there is a bigger opportunity in augmented reality, which hasn't gotten far off the ground.

""You need a device that both men and women can wear comfortably for many hours"" for that to work, he says. Enterprise applications will emerge first, he argues. Imagine technicians or physicians seeing data in front of them as they work.

But in the long run, he thinks AR glasses could become a replacement for smartphones for many applications. Amon says that while semiconductor processor, battery, and connectivity issues for AR glasses have been addressed, the challenge now is finding the right form factor.

That problem will be solved as well, he says.

Amon sees a range of edge computing applications, particularly the internet of things, as the primary driver for the company's larger addressable market. That includes consumer applications, including both phone-related peripherals like earbuds and watches and stand-alone hardware like robots and fitness equipment. He sees an opportunity in IoT-related networking, as well. But the area with the most potential, he says, is the industrial internet of things, for applications like smart cities, retailing, warehousing cameras, hand-held devices, and many others. The company already has 13,000 industrial IoT customers, Amon notes.

Amon will deliver a keynote speech at the conference on Thursday on the future of transportation, along with Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, who will participate virtually.

The CES show floor officially opens on Wednesday, and continues through Friday.

Qualcomm shares on Tuesday rose 0.6%, to $187.23 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3%.

But beneath the environmentally friendly hardware there's another innovation: Microsoft's Pluton security processor.

The new Lenovo ThinkPad Z13 and Z16, announced Tuesday at the International CES tech show in Las Vegas, are the first PCs to be unveiled with Pluton since Microsoft announced the security architecture in November 2020. Pluton takes security technologies that otherwise exist in a separate hardware component in Windows PCs and integrates them directly into the central processing unit.

In this case, the CPU is the new AMD Ryzen PRO 6000 Series processor.

""Our co-development work with Microsoft eliminates entire attack vectors on notebooks, better protecting critical data like system credentials, user identities, encryption keys and personal information,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su in the company's CES press briefing Tuesday morning. ""The Pluton processor, combined with our other security features, delivers the most innovative security in a PC processor.""

Pluton is modeled after the chip design that Microsoft introduced with the Xbox One in 2013. The company also uses the technology its Azure Sphere processors for Internet of Things devices.

It's ""designed to store sensitive data, like encryption keys, securely within the Pluton hardware, which is integrated into the die of a device's CPU and is therefore more difficult for attackers to access, even if they have physical possession of a device,"" as explained in a post by David Weston, Microsoft director of enterprise and OS security. ""This design helps ensure that emerging attack techniques cannot access key material.""

Lenovo says the Z13 and Z16 will be available in May, starting at $1,549 and $2,099, respectively.

Microsoft calls this the ""start of the Pluton journey with the Windows ecosystem,"" saying other hardware makers and chip companies are also working to integrate Pluton into upcoming products. Intel and Qualcomm took part in the original Pluton announcement along with AMD in 2020.

In other processor news out of CES, Microsoft and Qualcomm said they are working together to develop new custom chips for augmented reality glasses.

Qualcomm said Tuesday at CES that the company is working with Microsoft to develop custom augmented-reality chips to help the two companies develop lightweight augmented-reality glasses.

Qualcomm, which has already developed what it calls its Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform, plans to integrate it with Microsoft Mesh, Microsoft's own platform to help it establish the metaverse that Facebook (now Meta) popularized. Qualcomm didn't provide a timeline for when the development work would be completed.

We're announcing that we're developing a custom augmented-reality Snapdragon chip, for next-generation, power-efficient, very lightweight AR glasses for the Microsoft ecosystem, and we're integrating into that chip platform software from both companies, Cristiano Amon, the chief executive of Qualcomm, said during a press conference at CES 2022.

We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale, Amon continued. I'm very excited about this partnership. It's a step in making that a reality and gaining more and more scale with augmented reality.

It's unclear whether Microsoft will actually develop the device, or whether it's being developed for a Microsoft partner. Microsoft, of course, has its own HoloLens platform, which it developed as an augmented-reality device when most of its competition was turning to virtual-reality, instead. Microsoft's partners, including HP and Samsung, followed Microsoft's lead into developing Mixed Reality devices that were essentially virtual reality headsets, and which flopped.

Augmented-reality glasses, of course, are what Google developed with Google Glass. Google later phased out Glass after users complained that they didn't want to be recorded by users wearing Glass. Is Microsoft developing a next-generation HoloLens, or is designing a revamped device that's more like Glass? We'll have to wait and see.

Volvo, Honda, and Renault will all use Qualcomm's so-called Digital Chassis, a suite of automotive solutions specifically developed to overhaul the driving experience with new-gen technology.

The three carmakers have already pledged to use Android Automotive on their new models, though in the case of Renault, its purpose is to use the Digital Chassis for more advanced capabilities. The French company is seeking improved connectivity, cloud services, and driver assistance features powered by Qualcomm's solutions.

Renault has already announced that its upcoming Megane E-Tech will use Android Automotive.

On the other hand, Honda and Volvo will work together with Qualcomm on their infotainment systems. Once again, the experience is powered by Android Automotive, Google's car-optimized operating system offering more advanced integration of services like Google Assistant and Google Maps.

The Digital Chassis comprises four different modules, each with its very own goal.

The first of them is called Snapdragon Ride, and its purpose is to power technology related to driver assistance and automated driving. Then, it's the Snapdragon Auto Connectivity, which comes with a pretty straightforward name, so its goal is to bring fast connectivity (LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi) to new-gen cars.

The Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud Services serve as the foundation of cloud-powered capabilities, such as OTA and the subscriptions that nobody likes. And last but not least, the Digital Chassis includes the Snapdragon Cockpit, whose main responsibility is to make the multimedia experience possible in a car where Qualcomm's platform is installed.","{'uri': 'autoevolution.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'autoevolution'}","[{'uri': 'bogdan_popa@autoevolution.com', 'name': 'Bogdan Popa', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/the-digital-chassis-is-here-to-power-the-next-gen-android-experience-178286_1.jpg,0.2156862745098038,eng-7383748,False,0.7254902124404907,0.2156862745098038,379034460,3

But the real driver behind the surge has been the market's realization that the company has a huge runway ahead of it.

At an upbeat meeting with analysts in New York late last year, Qualcomm (ticker: QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon made the case that the company had line of sight to expand the market it can address from about $100 billion currently to $700 billion a few years from now. The company is a well-positioned play on multiple emerging trends, including connected cars, the metaverse, edge computing, wireless fiber, and a new generation of communications-centric laptops.

In an interview with Barron's on Tuesday at the CES tech trade show, just after addressing a standing-room-only crowd at a press conference, Amon discussed some of the reasons he is bullish about the long-term outlook. Qualcomm is playing a central role in the discussion at CES around connected and autonomous cars, , the company made announcements on new partnerships with Honda, Volvo and Renault. Yet there are other emerging story lines, some not fully appreciated by the market.

The company sees a growing opportunity in PCs. During the press conference, Amon highlighted growing adoption of Qualcomm's ARM-based Snapdragon processors for Windows-based PCs, noting agreements by companies like HP Inc. (HPQ), Acer, Asus, and Lenovo to use the chips in some devices. Amon won't directly say that the chips pose a threat to PC incumbents Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), but instead says that Qualcomm is ""focused on the next generation of laptops which take full advantage of mobile technologies.""

The company is well known in the electronics industry, both for its TVs and its phones. In addition to phones under its own name, at one point the company also made Blackberry phones (via TechRadar).

TCL's 30 Series line of phones includes the 5G-equipped TCL 30 XE 5G and 30 V 5G for the US market, and the TCL 30 5G coming soon for the European market.

The TCL 30 XE 5G is destined for T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile; it features a display with a 90Hz refresh rate, 4 GB of RAM, and a battery designed to last all day and into the night. This model is the company's first 5G phone for T-Mobile's network.

In contrast, the TCL 30 V 5G is slated for Verizon. This model will feature 128GB of internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset, 4500mAh battery, and a 6.7-inch HD screen. The phone comes with a whopping 50MP main camera and a 16MP front camera.

Both models feature an AMOLED display, complete with anti-scratch resistance. TCL says it will announce the prices for its new models in the ""coming weeks"" when they arrive at T-Mobile and Verizon. Though we don't yet know what they will cost, TCL promises they'll be ""affordable yet powerful.""

In addition to its new line of smartphones, TCL announced the all-new LINKHUB 5G router.

5G is poised to revolutionize the wireless industry, as well as the home internet market. The fastest variety of 5G delivers speeds in the gigabits, while the more commonly available variety still delivers speeds competitive with traditional broadband. Add in the benefit of not needing to run fiber to individual homes, and 5G promises to help close the ""digital divide"" between urban and rural internet access availability.

TCL clearly has this market in mind with its new router. The device offers Wi-Fi 6 and supports up to 256 users, making it ideal for smart homes and their plethora of connected devices.

Another big issue is price rises with brands telling ChannelNews that retailers ""have to wear the cost of price rises coming in 2022""

Several of the brands are also holding back press releases because they are uncertain as to whether their new 2022 which they are unable to show to buyers will be picked up when they do one on one visits with retailers locally.

Normally manufacturers design a product, show it to retailers and if they get orders at CES they move it into production.

One major brand who did not want to be named said ""New designs in particular new product innovation is often driven by new processors or processor innovation. During the past year it's been impossible to get chips let alone new generation processors.""

""This is having an impact on what new products a Company can deliver resulting in a lot of the new 2022 CES products being design variations of last years products"".

Several Australian distributors that are at the show told ChannelNews that it's going to be tough getting a fix on new products for 2022 because so many brands have chosen to not attend the Las Vegas event.

There is also major concern about price rises with several brands telling ChannelNews that prices are set to rise by up to 25% because of material price rises and shipping cost.

One local executive said ""Retailers have to absorb these cost rises. Prior to the holiday season retailers were pushing brands to absorb price rises this cannot happen in 2022"".

Another major brand executive said, ""We have grown our online operation in Australia by over 500% and if CE retailers keep pushing back against price rises, we will simply sell direct as we have no other choice because suppliers like us are not prepared to absorb the cost of price rises"".

As brands struggle to get processors a chip war has broken out at CES with Intel, Nvidia, and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) and Qualcomm set to go after each other's clients with new processor and semiconductor offerings.

The move comes as Intel the world's largest PC processor to date struggles to hold onto share. Their answer to the decline in demand for their products is a new graphics chips aimed at fighting Nvidia and AMD who have a major share of the PC gaming market which is one of the most profitable for PC manufacturers.

Up to now Intel has dominated in the PC market now Qualcomm, the biggest maker of mobile-phone chips, is pushing hard to take share away from Intel especially as PC brands are looking to deliver lighter high-performance notebooks that have better power management.

Qualcomm is leveraging its strength in smartphone technology.

The shift in the competitive landscape is set to play out in retail stores in Australia where retailers such as Harvey Norman who are seeing a significant increase in demand for PCs from the likes of Lenovo, HP and Acer.

Bloomberg claims that Intel's loss of leadership in chip-manufacturing technology has exposed it to challenges from newly confident rivals in the PC market.

The company's response under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is to defend that market and, at the same time, to chase sales in its rivals' strongest businesses.

That fight will likely play out beyond 2022, with most analysts predicting Intel will struggle to boost sales this year, compared with revenue gains forecast for the other companies.

Earlier today at CES Intel announced its 12th generation Core mobile processors, including 28 new models that are as much as 40% faster than their predecessors.

they also introduced a new Arc graphics chip which is currently being shipped to PC makers, including Acer, Dell, and HP.

The Arc chips are Intel's attempt to cut into the dominance of Nvidia and AMD in high-end graphics.

Nvidia countered by unveiling new graphics chips for laptops, aimed at bringing high-end gaming and artificial intelligence capabilities to the thinnest and lightest computers.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics processor will equip notebooks that will be priced starting at $3,000, giving them better capabilities than many previous high-end desktop models claim Nvidia executives.

Notebooks running on the 3070 Ti chip will start at around $2,000.

At CES AMD CEO Lisa Su showed off new laptop and graphics processors, meant to continue the company's run of stealing market share from Intel. AMD's graphics chips have come closer in performance to Nvidia's, but the larger company still controls the majority of the market for add-in cards for PC gamers that can cost more than $1,200.","{'uri': 'channelnews.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ChannelNews'}","[{'uri': 'david_richards@channelnews.com.au', 'name': 'David Richards', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'nathan_jolly@channelnews.com.au', 'name': 'Nathan Jolly', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.channelnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/intel-arc-logo-16x9-1.png,-0.02745098039215688,,False,0,-0.02745098039215688,379033020,2

Of these the first company I have up is AMD that showed off new Ryzen Mobile processors, new discrete GPUs for mobile and desktop, an upcoming desktop CPU with V-Cache, and provided a look at the Zen 4-based Ryzen 7000 series.

Starting with the mobile parts, the Ryzen 6000 Series Mobile processors are coming and will be utilizing an enhanced Zen 3+ core built on the 6 nm manufacturing node. The enhancements are to improve efficiency and speed with the top-end being able to boost to 5.0 GHz, but the changes most might be interested in come from the integrated GPU, as the company has finally stepped away from Vega and to RDNA 2. The Vega architecture has certainly been serving AMD well over its lifespan, especially as the company continued to find ways to improve it, but there are simply some things that could only be achieved by moving to the newer design. With the RDNA 2 GPU, these mobile processors should be able to offer double the graphics performance of their predecessors, and AMD is claiming 70% better performance than the Intel Core i7-1165G7, according to the footnotes. Of course independent reviewers will need to verify this claim, but such a leap in performance does not seem too unreasonable to accompany this architecture shift. Also, being an RDNA 2 GPU means it will support DirectX 12 Ultimate features, such as ray tracing, mesh shaders, and variable rate shading.

The mobile CPUs are also going to utilize DDR5, support both PCIe 4.0 and USB 4, offer Wi-Fi 6E from Qualcomm and MediaTek, and have AI noise cancellation circuitry built into the die. These will also be the first CPUs to feature the Microsoft Pluton security processors, which will support all of Windows 11's security features. AMD's Secure Processor and Memory Guard technologies are also present.

In total AMD has ten Ryzen 6000 Series mobile CPUs listed for arriving this year, with the first devices from OEM partners to arrive in February, but there are also three new Ryzen 5000 series mobile processors in the stack as well. Looking just at the 6000 series though, we have seven 8 core/16 thread processors from the Ryzen 7 6800U, a 15 W to 28 W part, up to the Ryzen 9 6980HX with a TDP of 45+ W. There are also a few 6 core/12 thread parts in the Ryzen 5 6600U, 6600HS, and 6600H. Each of these have a maximum boost of 4.5 GHz with the TDP being the variable. The six core parts have 19 MB of cache while the eight cores all have 20 MB.

Turning to the discrete GPUs, AMD announced both discrete mobile and desktop processors. For the desktop the RX 6500 XT and RX 6400 are coming, though the latter is destined for OEMs. The former is targeting the 1080p market with 16 Compute Units, 16 MB of Infinity Cache, and only 4 GB of GDDR6 memory. While those are not necessarily very impressive, the Game Frequency is 2610 MHz, the highest among the Radeon 6000 series GPUs. It is to be available from partners only (meaning there are no reference cards from AMD) on January 19 with a suggested price of $199.99.

For the mobile graphics, AMD announced new Radeon RX 600M products, including the RX 6850M XT that aims for 1440p gaming on premium laptops. The company is claiming it will be 7% faster than the current RX 6800M mobile GPU. The RX 6000S series is to offer powerful mobile gaming in slim designs, including laptops that can come in under 4.5 pounds. The RX 6800S at 100 W is expected to deliver up to 100 FPS at 1080p in select titles at max settings, and even beat the mobile RTX 3080 by 10%, according to the footnote.

Along with this new hardware, AMD also shared information on some of its new software that will help get the most out of it, under the AMD Advantage program. This includes Smart Access Memory, which has been updated to support the new processors, but also the additions of SmartShift Max, SmartShift Eco, and Smart Access Graphics. The original SmartShift system was to share a laptop's power budget between the CPU and GPU, so CPU-light tasks can see more power go to the GPU, and vice-versa. With SmartShift Max the technology has been improved to offer as much as double the performance in some games that already worked with SmartShift, and games that did not benefit before now will. SmartShift Eco, when it is available later this year, will automatically shift between using the discrete and integrated GPUs based on if you are on battery or plugged in, to potentially double the time you can game. Smart Access Graphics will improve performance by 15% on average by changing how the discrete GPU connects to the display. Instead of the GPU rendering the frame and having to pass it to the CPU to be sent to the display, it can be sent directly, removing this potential bottleneck.

AMD showed the Alienware m17 R5 laptop, which will be an AMD Advantage laptop with up to the Ryzen 6980HX APU paired with up to the RX 6850M XT GPU and is to launch in Q2. Arriving earlier, in Q1, will be the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, a 14 in laptop that will have up to the Ryzen 9 6900 HS and RX 6800S GPU. We can expect laptops from other board partners, such as Acer, Lenovo, and HP as well.

There is still a bit more to cover before getting to the desktop CPU news as AMD also talked about updates coming to its Adrenalin Edition graphics drivers. The highlight for some would certainly be the official announcement of Radeon Super Resolution that will leverage the same algorithm as FidelityFX Super Resolution, but be available via the driver rather than requiring in-game implementation. It will require running the game in exclusive fullscreen and on an RDNA-based GPU or newer. Also coming is AMD Link 5.0 to enable users to stream gameplay on phone, tablet, or another Windows computer almost anywhere, and Privacy View. Using Eyeware, Privacy View will apply head and eye tracking to monitor where you are looking on the screen, and blur or darken the rest to avoid prying eyes. It will also monitor your presence to know when it can lock your computer.

The version of Adrenalin to include these features is expected in H1.

Now for the news of upcoming desktop CPUs, starting with the Ryzen 7 5800X3D that uses V-Cache to add 64 MB to its total memory. For those who may not remember, V-Cache is the means by which AMD showed off for stacking additional L3 cache onto CPUs, which can have a significant impact on performance. The 5800X3D will have 32 MB of L3 cache in its traditional, 2D design and an additional 64 MB of this 3D cache, for a total of 100 MB between L2 and L3. It will also have a TDP of 105 W and is to launch in Spring 2022 for socket AM4. AMD is claiming an average of 5% greater performance at 1080p against the Core i9-12900K and 15% better than the current 5900X.

Lastly, a next generation Zen 4 CPU was shown off, providing a preview of the future Ryzen 7000 series that is to arrive in the second half of this year. It will be manufactured on a 5 nm process and use the AM5 socket, which will be LGA 1718 as opposed to using some form of PGA, like AMD has for many generations of consumer sockets. When held up we could see the IHS had cutouts around its perimeter, as opposed to being completely edge-to-edge, and a demo of it running Halo Infinite was shown too. Though no performance counter was shown during this preview, which was said to be running on an engineering sample, it was stated the CPU had all of its cores at 5 GHz. It will be interesting to see what more AMD might be able to get out of the design in the months ahead of launch, as well as what the power usage and thermal output are.","{'uri': 'overclockersclub.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Overclockers Club'}",[],,0.2705882352941176,eng-7380602,False,0.686274528503418,0.2705882352941176,379032780,1

The carrier announced today that it expects to use it to bring its 5G Ultra Wideband service to more than 100 million people throughout more than 1,700 cities around the U.S. by the end of January, thanks largely to the soon-to-be-deployed C-band spectrum.

A clash of carriers, airlines, and regulators

Last March, Verizon dropped $45 billion to acquire a chunk of the new 5G spectrum being auctioned off by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), gaining 280 MHz of spectrum in the newly available 3.7GHz to 3.98GHz band.

Verizon planned to begin rolling out the new spectrum on December 5, 2021, although it agreed in early November to push that back to January 5, 2022, to help alleviate concerns raised by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and aviation industry experts about potential aircraft interference.

However, that controversy is still raging on, and last week U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Chief Steve Dickson asked both Verizon and AT&T to push back the planned rollout by another two weeks. At first, both carriers firmly refused that request, but later relented following a day of intensive discussions on Monday with representatives from the aviation sector.

Following the talks, President Joe Biden even weighed in, with a statement from The White House calling ""last night's agreement a significant step in the right direction,"" and thanking everyone involved ""for their cooperation and good faith."" Biden adds that his administration remains ""committed to rapid 5G deployment, while minimizing disruptions to air operations.""

The statement from The White House also appears to put a pretty firm pin on January 19 as the rollout date for the new spectrum, with the president noting that the agreement ""puts us on track to substantially reduce disruptions to air operations when AT&T and Verizon launch 5G on January 19.""

Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband Network

Although it seems like Verizon is preparing to move ahead rapidly with its C-band expansion, it's also muddying the waters a bit by rolling the new spectrum into its 5G Ultra Wideband tier.

As of now, Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network consists exclusively of the much higher-frequency mmWave spectrum, which operates at the 28GHz and 39GHz frequencies -- well above the 3.7GHz to 3.98GHz C-band spectrum.

These mmWave frequencies offer much faster speeds that can peak well above 1Gbps under ideal conditions, but also suffer from very limited range. As a result, Verizon hasn't deployed its mmWave service outside a few major city cores.

The new midrange C-band spectrum promises to offer a much wider deployment, but it's also safe to say that most of these 100 million new customers that Verizon's Ultra Wideband Network will soon be reaching won't see performance anywhere close to the ""speeds up to 10x faster than 4G LTE"" that Verizon is promising.

Of course, that doesn't mean that Verizon customers won't see a dramatic speed improvement. Until now, only Verizon's 5G Nationwide network has been available outside those few major cities where the carrier has deployed mmWave. Not only do these towers operate in lower 600MHz spectrum, but they also share bandwidth with Verizon's 4G LTE network.

In fact, independent tests conducted by PC Magazine's Sascha Segan in late 2020 and early 2021 revealed that Verizon's 5G Nationwide service was often slower than its 4G LTE. This means that regardless of what Verizon is calling its new C-Band network, it's safe to say that many more Verizon customers are going to notice a remarkable improvement once the new frequencies come to their neighborhoods.

Editors' Recommendations AT&T, Verizon backtrack on airline fears, agree to delay rollout of 5G spectrum AT&T and Verizon forge ahead with new 5G deployments despite aviation industry fears I've paid for 5G for more than 2 years and it has been a complete waste of money Metaverse and 5G: The hollow buzzword match made in heaven Apple works with TSMC on its own 5G modems to complete breakup with Qualcomm","{'uri': 'digitaltrends.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Digital Trends'}","[{'uri': 'jesse_hollington@digitaltrends.com', 'name': 'Jesse Hollington', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://icdn.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/verizon-5g-super-bowl-2020.jpg,0.08235294117647052,eng-7383492,False,0.6627451181411743,0.08235294117647052,379032780,1

Qualcomm said Tuesday at CES that the company is working with Microsoft to develop custom augmented-reality chips to help the two companies develop lightweight augmented-reality glasses.

Qualcomm, which has already developed what it calls its Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform, plans to integrate it with Microsoft Mesh, Microsoft's own platform to help it establish the metaverse that Facebook (now Meta) popularized. Qualcomm didn't provide a timeline for when the development work would be completed.

We're announcing that we're developing a custom augmented-reality Snapdragon chip, for next-generation, power-efficient, very lightweight AR glasses for the Microsoft ecosystem, and we're integrating into that chip platform software from both companies, Cristiano Amon, the chief executive of Qualcomm, said during a press conference at CES 2022.

We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale, Amon continued. I'm very excited about this partnership. It's a step in making that a reality and gaining more and more scale with augmented reality.

It's unclear whether Microsoft will actually develop the device, or whether it's being developed for a Microsoft partner. Microsoft, of course, has its own HoloLens platform, which it developed as an augmented-reality device when most of its competition was turning to virtual-reality, instead. Microsoft's partners, including HP and Samsung, followed Microsoft's lead into developing Mixed Reality devices that were essentially virtual reality headsets, and which flopped.

Augmented-reality glasses, of course, are what Google developed with Google Glass. Google later phased out Glass after users complained that they didn't want to be recorded by users wearing Glass. Is Microsoft developing a next-generation HoloLens, or is designing a revamped device that's more like Glass? We'll have to wait and see.

The metaverse is about as an ambiguous topic as you can get -- despite the implication that Meta could own such a term given its recent rebrand from Facebook -- but the term encompasses so much more than living in a virtual world hidden behind a pair of VR glasses. That's why Microsoft and Qualcomm have partnered up to develop both hardware and software technologies for one specific corner of the metaverse market.

We're talking specifically about AR glasses, a type of smart glasses that packs transparent or projected displays in the lenses of a pair of glasses to help overlay virtual objects onto the physical world. Microsoft has been a leader in this space since 2016 when it debuted its HoloLens AR glasses, and now the next generation of HoloLens and other AR glasses could be powered by the new chipset that Qualcomm and Microsoft are developing.

That new chipset is being specifically designed to enable the development of lighter and more power-efficient AR glasses, something that's sorely needed in the space if companies want to progress beyond the existing enterprise space and into the consumer realm.","{'uri': 'androidcentral.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Central'}",[],https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/qualcomm_snapdragon_865_5g_mobile_platform_-_chip_front.jpg,0.2392156862745098,eng-7383810,False,0.6000000238418579,0.2392156862745098,379031400,2

He said that future devices from the collaboration will work with a Microsoft software product called Mesh that allows users to beam a realistic likeness of themselves into the headset of another user so that it feels like the two people are in the same room.

The future hardware will also use software from Qualcomm called Snapdragon Spaces that helps perform basic augmented reality functions like mapping out physical spaces so that digital objects can be overlaid on them and hand-tracking so that users can manipulate those digital objects with hand gestures.

With every week bringing nerve-racking headlines and the market weaving up and down like a rollercoaster track, it was a challenging start to the new year.

But with every market event comes significant opportunities -- though not necessarily the ones that seem obvious.

Today, we'll take our final look back to your favorite 2021 Smart Money articles by looking at the GameStop-AMC-Reddit short-squeeze debacle -- and what it implies for your money even today.

Note: This article was originally published on Jan. 13, 2021.

Welcome to Reddit-land!

Thanks to this online stock-chat forum, numerous previously unloved stocks have been rocketing higher over the past few weeks.

Reddit has become a powerful, albeit narrowly focused, force in the stock market, and Reddit traders have sunk their teeth into heavily shorted names like GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) and created massive ""short squeezes.""

In other words, the Reddit traders have been buying these stocks... then coaxing others to buy these stocks... then boasting about the thousands they've made buying these stocks... and then gloating about the millions that hedge funds and other professional short-sellers have lost by betting against these stocks.

Before this began, GameStop shares were trading hands below $20. But by Friday, Jan. 8, 2021, they were trading around $350!

And since nothing succeeds like success, the Reddit crowd has been scouting around for some fresh red meat.

Already, some folks are calling what we've seen over the past few weeks the ""future of the market.""

That led U.S. Representative Alexandria Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to find the one thing they agree on: Robinhood shouldn't be doing that.

And here's a headline, from Fox Business, that none of us ever expected to see: ""Treasury Secretary Yellen 'Monitoring' GameStop Stock Situation.""

While the Securities and Exchange Commission may toss some regulations in their way, the Reddit Army's share-price manipulations are likely now a part of the stock market.

The inmates will occasionally get to run the asylum. It's just something we'll all have to consider when making trade decisions.

But for the most part, it'll be a sideshow. The market will continue churning along... and Wall Street and smart investors will keep making money.

Now, I'm not here for a lecture about ""fundamentals"" or the ""purpose of the stock market."" After all, the stock market left reality behind a long time ago.

These are smart kids, there are a lot of them, and they're going to keep finding flaws in the market to exploit. Good for them!

If you want to join them -- and you don't risk more than you can afford to lose -- have at it. However, treating the market like a casino just isn't what we do here or in my other services.

After all, the Reddit Army could evaporate as quickly as they appeared. So, there is no real disciplined or academic way to trade off these frenzies.

If one of my trades gets caught up in the chaos, I'd be stupid to not suggest cashing in. But I will not recommend buying any stock as a play on Reddit chat.

Instead, I'll keep using a global-macro approach to find and recommend stocks and other trades as long-term plays on huge trends like the global 5G deployment.

That story continues to gain traction...

5G isn't simply the thing-that-comes-after-4G. It is a uniquely powerful investment opportunity that will deliver outsized gains for many years to come.

Trillions of investment dollars will flow toward and through 5G infrastructure over the next several years, no matter how well or poorly the global economy is faring.

Qualcomm estimates that 5G networks will generate a whopping $13.2 trillion in global sales activity by 2035. Typically, an industry measures its growth potential in the billions of dollars, not trillions.

Perhaps that's why telecommunication companies are placing astoundingly huge bets on 5G's future profitability. They're doing so through their bids in federally run 5G airwaves auctions.

In January 2021, U.S. wireless carriers like Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and pay-tv providers like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) bid more than $80 billion for access to 5G airwaves in auctions run by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). That's far more than analysts' estimates of $47 billion... and it smashes the old record of $45 billion in 2015.

Telcos are spending all those billions now because they believe in those forecast trillions in revenue in the years to come.

Also in January, China upped the ante on 5G growth by unveiling ambitious new plans to nearly double its 5G wireless capacity in 2021.

Clearly, we're on the cusp of a 5G revolution... and this revolution will create enormous opportunities for select companies and their shareholders.

No company or country can afford to ignore 5G or to lag behind constructing and utilizing it. This new network will quickly become the essential oxygen of the coming tech-based economy... and the dollars involved will be astronomical.

The 5G revolution is far from over; as I've mentioned before, we're only in the first or second inning of it. But some companies are prospering already from this new megatrend. In fact, during the 12 months that have passed since the article above first appeared, many of my 5G-focused stock recommendations have delivered ""surprisingly strong"" earnings growth.

Obviously, this growth has not been a complete surprise to my subscribers and me. It is exactly what we have been anticipating... and exactly what has been powering recommendations like Ciena (NYSE:CIEN), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), and Aviat Networks (NASDAQ:AVNW) to market-beating gains.

I'm expecting the 5G sector to continue gaining momentum in 2022.

Both prosecutors and defense attorneys had recommended home confinement for Yisroel Goldstein, citing his leadership in the weeks following the 2019 attack on Chabad of Poway, the immense physical and emotional trauma the former rabbi continues to battle, and his cooperation in the FBI's fraud investigation.

But the judge rejected that punishment as not appropriate given the seriousness of the crimes.

""You not only committed this offense yourself but you took a lot of people with you,"" U.S. District Court Judge Cynthia Bashant told Goldstein, 60.

""It's important to send a message to the community and important to send a message to you,"" she added.

Goldstein must also pay about $2.8 million in restitution, an amount shared with several other defendants who were prosecuted as participants in the financial cons.

He must self-surrender by Feb. 23, although he could appeal for a later date if COVID-19 continues to surge. The judge agreed to recommend he be housed at a medium-security federal prison in Otisville, New York, which his defense attorney said is known to accommodate observant Jews.

As a rabbi in the Chabad movement -- which practices Orthodox Judaism but is also known for its welcoming nature -- Goldstein counted on the generosity of his congregation for his salary. He found other ways to supplement his income.

The FBI says Goldstein had his hand in a number of fraudulent schemes exploiting tax loopholes, corporate benevolence and government grant assistance.

Prosecutors said he personally earned at least $620,000 from the conspiracies.

The most prevalent of the schemes is known as the ""90/10"" fraud. Donors regularly made large charitable contributions to Chabad of Poway or one of its affiliated nonprofits, to be written off their taxes. But instead of the money going to the organizations, Goldstein secretly funneled 90 percent of it back to the donor, keeping 10 percent for himself. One donor got his donation returned in the form of $1 million in gold, prosecutors said.

At least a dozen people took Goldstein up on the tax-evasion scheme, resulting in at least $1.5 million in tax losses to the IRS, according to prosecutors.

In one variation on the scheme, donors would solicit their companies for matching charitable contributions. Goldstein would then return all of the original amount to the donor while keeping the corporation's matching funds. The corporations were given fraudulent donation receipts, and many took the tax deductions.

At least three Fortune 500 companies, including Qualcomm, were defrauded out of nearly $145,000 total.

In a letter to the judge and further statements in court, Goldstein expressed deep remorse.

""I beg for mercy to accept my repentance and allow me to right the wrongs and be able to live out the rest of my life with remorse and to be given the chance to do whatever I can to help others to the best of my ability,"" he told the judge Tuesday.

Goldstein, who first launched the synagogue in Rancho Bernardo in the 1980s, was long known as a leader in the local Jewish community. But he became an international figure, delivering a powerful message against hate, when he and three members of his congregation were shot in an anti-Semitic attack on April 27, 2019. One, Lori Gilbert-Kaye, whom he described in court as like a sister, was killed.

The gunman, John T. Earnest, 22, was recently sentenced to two life terms in prison on both state and federal charges.

Bullets struck the rabbi in both hands, causing him to lose a finger and leaving another severely injured.

Still, in the hours and days after the attack he delivered words of hope -- from an impromptu speech while standing on a chair right after the shooting to appearances at the White House and United Nations.

No one knew at the time that he was the subject of a fraud investigation that had been open for more than a year.

Goldstein stepped down as rabbi in November 2019, citing exhaustion. News of his crimes wasn't made public until the following summer, when he pleaded guilty to tax and wire fraud.

Microsoft collaborates with OpenSidewalks to chart more accessible sidewalk paths for people with mobility issues

In a Twitter post on Jan. 3, 2021, Microsoft announced a collaboration with the OpenSidewalks project to enhance the navigation experience for people with disabilities.

Microsoft explained in the video post that hills and curbs can be obstructions to people who operate wheelchairs. To counter this problem, the company, along with the inclusive technology initiative G3ict and the Taskar Centre for Accessible Technology at the University of Washington, started to use AI to gather and analyze sidewalk data from Bing Maps imagery along with other data sources in February 2021, with the goal to create more accessible mobility datasets in cities globally.

Through the initiative, they released a tool that provides the user with additional accessibility options, including the ability to select hill steepness and avoid paths with raised curbs. The user is then able to select from various routes that are ranked for accessibility.

The tool is currently available in three Washington state cities, but Microsoft hopes to bring it to Los Angeles, as well as cities in Brazil, Chile and Ecuador. The company is also working with city leaders, experts, and local residents to crowdsource data and to standardize open data sets.

Samsung to announce the Exynos 2200 SoC after CES

Samsung is set to announce the next-gen of its in-house Exynos 2200 system-on-chip (SoC) for mobile devices on Jan. 11 with a special feature: it will use AMD's RDNA graphics. It's so special, in fact, that the company is saving its announcement until after CES 2022, which Samsung is one of the few companies physically attending the event held in Las Vegas on Jan 5.

The two companies first announced their collaboration in June 2021. AMD CEO Lisa Su promised that AMD's RDNA graphics will enable Samsung's next-gen flagship SoC to feature advanced graphics technologies like ray tracing and variable rate shading.

AMD's RDNA graphics is already inside many desktop and laptop processors, but this is the first time it will debut inside a smartphone SoC. In addition to performance, its power consumption will also be a key topic of interest.

Samsung's Exynos chips are considered the equivalent of Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs. They're typically used in smartphones sold outside of North America.

Airlines ask FCC to delay 5G rollout

Several U.S. airlines are asking the Federal Communications Commission to delay 5G network rollouts near airports scheduled for next week.

The Airlines for America, a trade group for U.S. passenger aircraft and cargo carriers, warned the FCC that it didn't properly evaluate the interference 5G mobile network could cause to aircrafts. The group asked for more time to resolve potential safety issues related to the danger 5G poses to communication equipment pilots use to help navigate the planes.

In a letter to AT&T and Verizon last Friday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Stephen proposed a delay of 5G network rollout to AT&T and Verizon. They wrote that the activation of the 5G networks near airports ""will result in widespread and unacceptable disruption as airplanes divert to other cities or flights are cancelled.""

But beneath the environmentally friendly hardware there's another innovation: Microsoft's Pluton security processor.

The new Lenovo ThinkPad Z13 and Z16, announced Tuesday at the International CES tech show in Las Vegas, are the first PCs to be unveiled with Pluton since Microsoft announced the security architecture in November 2020. Pluton takes security technologies that otherwise exist in a separate hardware component in Windows PCs and integrates them directly into the central processing unit.

In this case, the CPU is the new AMD Ryzen PRO 6000 Series processor.

""Our co-development work with Microsoft eliminates entire attack vectors on notebooks, better protecting critical data like system credentials, user identities, encryption keys and personal information,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su in the company's CES press briefing Tuesday morning. ""The Pluton processor, combined with our other security features, delivers the most innovative security in a PC processor.""

Pluton is modeled after the chip design that Microsoft introduced with the Xbox One in 2013. The company also uses the technology its Azure Sphere processors for Internet of Things devices.

It's ""designed to store sensitive data, like encryption keys, securely within the Pluton hardware, which is integrated into the die of a device's CPU and is therefore more difficult for attackers to access, even if they have physical possession of a device,"" as explained in a post by David Weston, Microsoft director of enterprise and OS security. ""This design helps ensure that emerging attack techniques cannot access key material.""

Lenovo says the Z13 and Z16 will be available in May, starting at $1,549 and $2,099, respectively.

Microsoft calls this the ""start of the Pluton journey with the Windows ecosystem,"" saying other hardware makers and chip companies are also working to integrate Pluton into upcoming products. Intel and Qualcomm took part in the original Pluton announcement along with AMD in 2020.

In other processor news out of CES, Microsoft and Qualcomm said they are working together to develop new custom chips for augmented reality glasses.","{'uri': 'geekwire.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'GeekWire'}","[{'uri': 'todd_bishop@geekwire.com', 'name': 'Todd Bishop', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lenovo.png,0.223529411764706,eng-7385153,False,0.8980392217636108,0.223529411764706,379029840,2

Qualcomm said Tuesday at CES that the company is working with Microsoft to develop custom augmented-reality chips to help the two companies develop lightweight augmented-reality glasses.

Qualcomm, which has already developed what it calls its Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform, plans to integrate it with Microsoft Mesh, Microsoft's own platform to help it establish the ""metaverse"" that Facebook (now Meta) popularized. Qualcomm didn't provide a timeline for when the development work would be completed.

""We're announcing that we're developing a custom augmented-reality Snapdragon chip, for next-generation, power-efficient, very lightweight AR glasses for the Microsoft ecosystem, and we're integrating into that chip platform software from both companies,"" Cristiano Amon, the chief executive of Qualcomm, said during a press conference at CES 2022.

""We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale,"" Amon continued. ""I'm very excited about this partnership. It's a step in making that a reality and gaining more and more scale with augmented reality.""

It's unclear whether Microsoft will actually develop the device, or whether it's being developed for a Microsoft partner. Microsoft, of course, has its own HoloLens platform, which it developed as an augmented-reality device when most of its competition was turning to virtual-reality, instead. Microsoft's partners, including HP and Samsung, followed Microsoft's lead into developing Mixed Reality devices that were essentially virtual reality headsets, and which flopped.

Augmented-reality glasses, of course, are what Google developed with Google Glass. Google later phased out Glass after users complained that they didn't want to be recorded by users wearing Glass. Is Microsoft developing a next-generation HoloLens, or is designing a revamped device that's more like Glass? We'll have to wait and see.","{'uri': 'pcworld.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCWorld'}",[],https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Qualcomm-headset-Microsoft-mesh.png?w=1024,0.2156862745098038,eng-7383810,False,0.6549019813537598,0.2156862745098038,379029180,3

The DOCK710 and the DOCK720 come with virtually identical feature sets, save for the fingerprint sensor that has been integrated into the design of the DOCK720 for additional security.

The fingerprint-enabled DOCK720 - formally known as the USB-C Hybrid/Universal 4K Quad Dock with 100W PD and Fingerprint ID - is being billed as the first device of its kind with biometric capabilities. The fingerprint integration is being realized through a partnership with Synaptics, which is supplying Targus with its SentryPoint biometric solution. SentryPoint is able to complete matches directly on the Prometheus FS7600 fingerprint sensor, and comes with built-in encryption and anti-spoofing features.

Beyond the biometric features, the DOCK720 USB-C, USB-A ports, and ethernet ports, and it can support either one single 8K resolution or four 4K displays through HDMI connections. The hybrid design leverages Synaptics' DisplayLink technology, and is compatible with major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and Chrome.

The DOCK710 is identical to the DOCK720 aside from the fingerprint sensor. Targus is pitching the DOCK710 as a more affordable home option for everyday consumers, while the DOCK720 is being geared toward enterprises with more stringent security requirements. Both devices will hit stores later this month at $372.99 and $442.99, respectively.

""As the workplace continues to move to remote and hybrid environments, today's organizations demand greater flexibility, collaboration, and security than ever before,"" said Targus Global Marketing and eCommerce VP Andrew Corkill. ""Our DOCK720 is a game changer for enterprises that require secure network connections from any location.""

Both docks will be on display at Booth #16734 during CES, which will run from January 5-7. FindBiometrics will be on site in Las Vegas to bring you live coverage of the event throughout the week.

Synaptics' Selene fingerprint sensor was previously featured in a new ThinkPad from Lenovo, while the company itself recently acquired DSP Group in an effort to boost its voice biometrics portfolio.

Intel was far and away the leading chip company for many years, dominating sales for PCs and servers. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has benefitted the top and bottom lines. However, Intel is facing challenges with smartphone chips and more competition. However, Intel has a new CEO, and he is undoing some of the questionable recent acquisitions.

Furthermore, the company is spending $100 billion on new fabs. Intel is a Dividend Challenger with seven years of dividend growth. The stock is yielding about 2.6% and trading at a reasonable valuation. I view Intel as a long-term buy.

Intel is the global leader in microprocessors and microchips. The company's focus is designing and fabricating microprocessors for PCs and servers. Intel's microprocessors are found in retail and business PCs and data center servers. Intel also has products outside of these two core markets. The company developed 3D NAND and 3D Xpoint products. The 3D NAND business was divested to SK Hynix for $9 billion. Intel sold its 5G Modem business to Apple (APPL). In addition, Intel has been actively expanding by acquisition. The company acquired Altera in 2015 for FPGAs, Nervana, and Movidius in 2016 for AI chips, Mobileye in 2017 for automotive vision chips, and Habana Labs in 2019 for AI chips. Intel recently announced it was divesting Mobileye in an IPO. Total revenue was $77,867 million in 2020 and $78,474 in LTM. Intel has a market capitalization of ~$209.45 billion.

Intel is a dividend growth stock that has raised the dividend for seven consecutive years, making the company a Dividend Challenger. Intel has paid a dividend going back to 1992. The current forward dividend rate is $1.39 per share, and the stock is yielding approximately 2.61% as of this writing. This dividend yield is more than the 5-year average of about 2.54%, and it is more than double the average of the S&P 500 Index.

The company last announced a quarterly dividend increase of 5.3% to $0.3475 per share from $0.31 per share on January 21, 2021. Investors should expect another dividend increase in this quarter. Intel's dividend growth rates are roughly 6.0% in the trailing 5-years and 5.9% in the past decade. According to the Chowder Rule, this gives a Chowder Number (CDN) of 8.67%.

In addition, Intel has excellent dividend safety marks from the context of earnings, free cash flow (FCF), and the balance sheet.

From an earnings perspective, the dividend was safe in the year 2021. The payout ratio was approximately 25% based on an annual dividend of $1.30 per share and non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.28. The company has yet to increase the dividend for 2022, but assuming a 6% dividend growth rate, the payout ratio will remain low even after assuming the bottom-line declines in 2022. My target value for payout ratio is 65% suggesting the dividend is very safe

The dividend is also very safe from the viewpoint of free cash flow. In the LTM, free cash flow was about $17,326 million. The dividend required $5,584 million, giving a dividend-to-FCF ratio of roughly 32%. This percentage is well below my threshold percentage of 32%, indicating a safe dividend.

Intel has a conservative balance sheet. At the end of Q3 2021, the company had ~$34,635 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading securities. There is no short-term debt, current long-term debt is $4,694 million, and long-term debt is $35,610 million. Debt is not a risk for the dividend with the leverage ratio at 0.11X and interest coverage more than 36X.

Intel's advantages include market dominance in chips for PCs and data center servers. The company's advantage extends to its internal design and manufacturing process. This point gives Intel scale and cost efficiencies few other chip manufacturers can match. Many other chip designers lack fabrication facilities and outsource to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM), Samsung Electronics, and Globalfoundries Inc (NASDAQ:GFS). Intel's scale and cash flow permit it to invest in fabs when other companies cannot. Lastly, Intel's balance sheet is conservative, giving it flexibility for acquisitions and capital expenditures.

However, Intel is in an increasingly competitive industry. The smartphone weakened Intel's hold on microprocessors and chips. Other companies such as ARM and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) lead in cell phone and modem chips. In addition, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the leader in graphics chips and is acquiring ARM. Lastly, Intel has faced delays in implementing 10 nm manufacturing technologies allowing AMD to launch competitive products.

Intel is undervalued despite the recent run-up in stock price from late October. The stock price is well off its 52-week high. At the current stock price, Intel trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 10.1X. The multiple in the past decade has been close to 12X, suggesting Intel is undervalued. The combination of market dominance in PCs and servers, scale, balance sheet, a growing dividend, dividend safety, and undervaluation makes Intel a long-term buy, in my opinion.","{'uri': 'valuewalk.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ValueWalk'}",[],https://valuewalk.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Intel_1641331461.jpg,0.05098039215686279,eng-7378624,False,0.5529412031173706,0.05098039215686279,379028580,1

The new partnership was announced at the Qualcomms CES 2022 keynote.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon has announced that he is developing a custom augmented reality Snapdragon chip for the next generation of power-efficient and extremely lightweight AR glasses for the Microsoft ecosystem. It was then integrated into the chip platform software of both the Microsoft Mesh platform and the recently announced Qualcomm Snapdragon Spaces XR development platform. Snapdragon Spaces will be fully integrated into Microsoft Mesh and the platform will be available for the next generation of lightweight eyeglasses.

Partnerships aren't all that surprising. The Qualcomms Snapdragon 850 chip has already powered the Microsoft HoloLens 2 headset since 2019. Qualcomm has also expanded its focus in recent years, including the Snapdragon XR2, which powers Oculus Quest, and is developing chips that are more specifically focused on AR and VR. 2. Microsoft and Qualcomm have also worked with custom chips in the past, such as the customized SQ1 and SQ2 processors on the Surface Pro X.

It's also worth noting that it includes support for both the Microsoft Mesh and Qualcomms Snapdragon Spaces XR platforms. Both platforms offer interesting mixed reality use cases that span multiple devices. While Mesh already has a cross-platform VR / AR system for connecting virtual reality headsets, tablets, smartphones and PCs, Spaces specifically features Qualcomm-powered smartphones as a second screen for mixed reality experiences. We aim to integrate. Also, given that Qualcomm's particular emphasis on future chip collaboration focused on ultra-lightweight augmented reality glasses, the two companies are big to integrate future projects into a more widely connected digital world. It's clear that they have ambitions.

Laptops featuring the new processors are set to launch later in 2022 and AMD claims that the batteries in the new processors could offer up to 24 hours of battery life.

These claims are intriguing, especially when you consider that the average battery life of current laptops can range from as low as two or three hours to seven or even eight hours on a single charge. AMD says the claim is based on expected battery life from idling, video playback, standby mode, and some gaming versus the previous generation of mobile processors.

However, there are always other factors to consider when looking at the battery life of a laptop, including what kind of graphics card the laptop uses, what kind of power supply it's running, and just the general build quality of the product.

If AMD is able to deliver on anything close to that 24-hour claim, though, it could mean a huge leap forward for battery life in laptops as a whole, which is a win for laptop users everywhere.

The AMD Ryzen 6000 Series mobile processors are also notable as the first (so far) to offer Microsoft's Pluton security processor, beating out competitors Qualcomm and Intel. This security chip, which is designed to replace the TPM, is based on the security tech used to protect the latest Xbox game consoles. Back in November, Microsoft said it was working with multiple companies on bringing Pluton to their CPUs, including AMD.

But this new mobile processor isn't the only thing that AMD has been working on. The company also recently announced its AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT, the newest graphics card to join its lineup. The Radeon RX 6500 XT sports 64 texture units, 1,024 stream processors, and 5.4 B transistors. Additionally, it also offers 16 ray accelerators, and 16 compute units, with a boost frequency of up to 2,815 MHz and a max 4GB of RAM. It's not the most powerful card that AMD has put out, but it should offer solid FPS in many of today's top games.

What really sets the new Radeon RX 6500 XT apart, though, is its use of AMD's RDNA 2 architecture. This GPU architecture is the same as that featured in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, and it offers support for high-resolution features like ray-tracing and AMD's Fidelity FX visual technology. The RX 6500 XT also makes use of AMD's new Navi 24 GPU structure on top of a 6nm node, according to AnandTech. The new desktop GPU is set to release on January 19 and will retail for just $199 when it becomes available.

If you're looking for a cheaper GPU option to play games at 1080p, then the RX 6500 XT could be a solid option. Of course, there are still other budget-friendly options out there, like the upcoming Nvidia RTX 3050, so make sure you find something that works for you and offers the performance and quality that you want from a graphics card.","{'uri': 'slashgear.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SlashGear'}",[],https://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/amd-main.jpg?w=640,0.1058823529411765,eng-7383091,False,0.7058823704719543,0.1058823529411765,379027680,1

Then join our Team! English native speakers welcome!

With the Galaxy M52 5G, Samsung introduces a powerful upgrade of its M series in the mid-range. Due to the up-to-date Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G, the M52 5G reaches a performance score that is more than 50% better than that of its predecessor. We particularly liked the display of the Galaxy M52 5G in the test: the attractive 6.7-inch, 120-Hz Super-AMOLED display is convincing in all areas and offers a very high brightness for this price class.

On the other hand, there was some cost-cutting in the relatively powerful batteries, which have been the distinguishing characteristics of the M-series phones in the recent past. While the Galaxy M51 still offered a 7000-mAh battery, the 2021 model has to be content with a capacity of 5000 mAh. This causes the mid-range smartphone from Samsung to lose the ""DNA"" of the Galaxy M series, so to speak, which consisted of the very long battery life due to a huge battery capacity.

This becomes very apparent in our WLAN test at an adjusted display brightness of 150 cd/m². The Galaxy M52 5G is surpassed by its predecessor by almost 12 hours, which feels like an eternity in this battery test.

Without this long battery life, the Galaxy M52 5G also to some extent loses its reason to exist as a member of the Galaxy family, in our view. The similarities to the Galaxy A52s 5G, which is similarly priced and better in many areas, make the representative of the M series look bad in the direct comparison. In addition to stereo speakers, a 3.5-mm audio port, and faster updates, the A52s 5G sibling model also offers an IP certification and a more high-quality case including Corning Gorilla Glass.

If you value a large display in an Android smartphone and are looking for a relatively affordable mid-range smartphone, you can get a detailed impression of the Samsung Galaxy M52 5G by taking a look at our extensive review.","{'uri': 'notebookcheck.net', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Notebookcheck'}",[],https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/Samsung/Galaxy_M52_5G/teaser.jpg,0.3725490196078431,eng-7377109,False,0.4235294163227081,0.3725490196078431,379027680,1

Qualcomm may be best known as the provider of chips that power many of the world's smartphones and tablets that don't have an Apple logo, but they also have a growing presence in the automotive industry. At CES 2022, Qualcomm is highlighting its Digital Chassis strategy and some of the automotive partners that are leveraging the technology.

Qualcomm has been supplying semiconductors to the automotive industry for two decades starting with its cellular technology for in-vehicle technology. As in-vehicle connectivity has moved toward universal installation in recent years, the San Diego-based company has been expanding its reach into other parts of the vehicle to grow its business and leverage the technology it has developed in the mobile industry. The Snapdragon 820A debuted several years ago for infotainment systems and is used on vehicles from multiple automakers including Jaguar Land Rover.

The Snapdragon Digital Chassis encompasses all of Qualcomm's automotive offerings including both hardware and software. It includes:

Qualcomm already has a strong position in the connectivity area and has some cockpit business but that and the ADAS/ADS business is set to grow significantly in the next few years.

On the digital cockpit side, Volvo, Renault, Honda and several Chinese automakers are all adopting the Snapdragon platform. Beginning with the replacement for the XC90 and the new Polestar 3 later this year, Volvo and Polestar's Android Automotive based infotainment will be running on Qualcomm processors. Honda will also launch a new vehicle in North America later this year that uses the combination of Android Automotive and Qualcomm before going global in 2023. This will be replacing the current system that runs on older Nvidia Tegra processors.

In the ADAS and ADS sector, a three-way battle between Mobileye, Nvidia and Qualcomm is shaping up. All three are offering a combination of both high-performance processors and software stacks including advanced perception and drive policy systems. While Mobileye has dominated the market for camera-based ADAS for more than a decade, many automakers are now adopting solutions from Nvidia and Qualcomm with either those vendor's software or in-house developed code.

In order to get its piece of the ADAS/ADS pie, Qualcomm is officially launching the Snapdragon Ride Vision System. As various new car assessment programs (NCAP) around the world are starting to incorporate more stringent tests of ADAS capabilities automakers are aiming to improve the performance of those systems. Since these systems all rely on at least machine vision, all major players are focusing on improving the reliability of vision perception. Qualcomm is using the Arriver Vision stack it initially developed in partnership with Veoneer. Qualcomm is currently in the process of acquiring the Arriver business unit from Veoneer.

The vision system is designed to support multiple cameras including higher resolution 8 MP cameras. The Qualcomm software development kit is designed to be modular so that automakers and tier 1 suppliers can use either Qualcomm's full stack or integrate the vision stack with drive policy stacks developed elsewhere. The Ride Vision system can also integrate a variety of other components including parking assist, driver monitoring and map crowdsourcing.

While automakers can use the Qualcomm's vision perception stack with their own drive policy software, Qualcomm is also working with OEMs to develop a common drive policy. While the core of this drive policy is intended to be used across multiple applications, elements of it can also be customized for specific use cases. The first production applications of Snapdragon Ride Vision System are expected in about 2024.

General Motors will be expanding the use of Qualcomm for cloud connected platforms later this year and it will also launch new models that are expected to be among the first that use the Snapdragon Ride ADAS processor combined with GM's own software. In 2023, the new Ultra Cruise system that enables hands-free driving into urban areas will also run on Snapdragon Ride with both the ADAS processor and the optional AI accelerator.

At its recent investor day, Qualcomm announced that BMW would also be adopting the Snapdragon Ride platform for its vehicles beginning in 2025 and that will utilize the full Ride Vision system. Renault is planning to adopt the entire Qualcomm Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform for vehicles beginning in 2025.

Other automakers leveraging various parts of the Snapdragon digital chassis are Hyundai, India's Mahindra & Mahindra and China's Jetour, Nio, Xpeng, WM Motor, SAIC and JiDu. Interestingly while most automakers are shifting toward these higher-powered processors and more centralized compute solutions, not all are going exclusively with one chip vendor. For example Volvo is using the Nvidia Orin for the centralized compute for ADAS/ADS, it is using Qualcomm for the digital cockpit. The same is true for Nio and Xpeng. In the wake of the current production disruptions caused by chip shortages, especially for older silicon technologies, the industry is trying to accelerate the transition to these more modern processors.

One of the advantages of going to a more centralized compute architecture with fewer higher powered compute nodes is the ability to shift workloads from one to another if to maintain fail operational capabilities if one part of the system goes down. While this is more complicated with a mixed compute environment it can be done if the system is designed with virtualization. Qualcomm is comparatively late to providing the ADAS/ADS compute relative to Mobileye and Nvidia and most of the near term programs were sourced before Snapdragon ride was available. As the next batch of vehicle programs are sourced, it's possible that more will follow the leads of BMW, Renault and Mercedes-Benz (which is going with Nvidia from 2024) and harmonize their compute platforms.","{'uri': 'forbes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Forbes'}",[],https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F61d476fc50f1a3edf5034ea8%2F0x0.jpg,0.0980392156862746,eng-7383748,False,0.7137255072593689,0.0980392156862746,379027260,13

A few years after Apple popularized the idea, HP is bringing a haptic trackpad to Chromebooks with its new Elite Dragonfly Chromebook.

Announced as part of HP's CES 2022 reveals, the Elite Dragonfly series comes in both Windows and Chrome OS flavors. The Chromebook version delivers a top-of-the-line laptop across the board, but one of its biggest reveals is the very first haptic trackpad on a Chromebook. HP says that the new trackpad is ""tightly"" integrated with the OS and provides users with more control.

Designed with a tight integration with Chrome OS, the world's first haptic trackpad on a Chromebook gives users a new dimension of control and responsiveness.

Beyond that new trackpad, HP's Elite Dragonfly Chromebook offers up a powerful package. It offers up a 13.5-inch, 16:9 display that can be configured up to a QHD 2256×1504 panel with another option hitting up to 1,000 nits of brightness. This new laptop will also be powered by Intel's 12th Gen processors complete with the vPro platform. Buyers can also select up to 32GB of RAM and up to 512GB of SSD storage. The internal battery hits up to 51Wh and HP claims it can charge up to 90% in 90 minutes over USB-C.

The Elite Dragonfly also has a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports, optional 5G support, HDMI out, and a USB 3.2 port, too. HP includes a fingerprint sensor and a privacy screen option for added security as well.

Pricing details on the HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook have yet to be revealed, but HP expects to launch this model alongside its Windows version in April. If it's like HP's other business-focused laptops, it'll likely also be available to general customers on the company's website.

""The office opening is further evidence of the company's commitment to bring new and exciting technologies to the Automotive sector,"" said Enrico Salvatori, senior vice president and president of Europe/MEA and Qualcomm Europe, in a statement.

The digital chassis is a suite of cloud-connected ""platforms"" which automakers can adopt in full or à la carte, and it includes: the Snapdragon Ride Platform for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving, the Auto Connectivity Platform for LTE, 5G connected services, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning, and the next generation of the Snapdragon Cockpit, a digital cockpit and infotainment system.

Qualcomm's integrated automotive platforms, including the digital chassis, have an order pipeline of more than $13 billion, according to the company. Snapdragon as it stands today is built off the back of Qualcomm's car-to-cloud service, announced at CES in 2020, which was the company's first product that aimed to keep cars connected to the cloud. This would allow for faster over-the-air updates and the ability to gather vehicle and usage analytics to create new revenue streams both for the company and for automaker partners.

""Qualcomm Technologies understands automakers' needs for uniqueness and differentiation as well as the tremendous opportunity to redefine the automotive and transportation business model,"" said Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and general manager of automotive at Qualcomm, in a statement. ""The Snapdragon Digital Chassis allows platforms to stay continually up-to-date with new capabilities after vehicle purchase, while allowing the automaker to create new features and services for enhanced customer engagement and services-based business models.""

Volvo became one of the many automakers to integrate Snapdragon into their vehicles, the companies announced on Tuesday. Volvo's upcoming fully electric SUV and Volvo EV brand Polestar's Polestar 3 SUV will both be powered by Qualcomm's digital cockpit, powered by Google's Android OS, and a suite of wireless technologies to support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and the automaker expects to launch vehicles with these features later this year.

Honda also shared plans to bring Qualcomm's digital cockpit to its upcoming models for the first time, which it expects to be commercially available in the U.S. in the second half of 2022 and across the globe in 2023.

Renault Group announced in September its plans to integrate the digital cockpit into its Mégane E-Tech electric vehicle, but on Tuesday, the company shared plans to expand that collaboration to the entire suite of digital chassis platforms, including the connectivity platform and the Snapdragon Ride platform.

Volvo, Honda and Renault join the increasingly long list of Qualcomm Snapdragon customers, which seemed to have picked up in earnest around the time Qualcomm acquired automotive tech company Veoneer in October. Since then, Qualcomm has signed on around 40 OEMs, including BMW, GM, Hyundai, JiDu, Xpeng, NIO and WM, to integrate different Snapdragon platforms into their vehicles.

Qualcomm's Snapdragon is also enabling other companies building automotive infotainment centers to innovate. At CES, the company announced a partnership with Alps Alpine to develop a ""Digital Cabin,"" which is powered by the Snapdragon cockpit. The cabin includes technologies such as an e-mirror that helps ameliorate blind spots by providing a peripheral view, a large ceiling display and sound zones that project noise individually to each passenger.

While most of Qualcomm's clients are opting to enhance their cockpits and infotainment systems, the company might be most bullish on its Ride platform, a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that should provide a powerful enough processor to allow for many ADAS and automated driving functions. Veoneer's Arriver self-driving software unit has only enhanced Ride, which has allowed it to compete directly with Nvidia's Drive Orin SoC, which is already being used to develop similar functionalities with customers like Cruise, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Zoox and, most recently, TuSimple.","{'uri': 'focustechnica.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'FocusTechnica'}",[],https://i2.wp.com/www.focustechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ces-2022-banner-11-scaled.jpg?fit=1200%2C165&ssl=1&w=640,0.4274509803921569,,True,0,0.4274509803921569,379026420,8

The San Diego, California, company once known for its mobile phone chips has created a range of automotive offerings, from self-driving car brains to chips that operate digital dashboards and infotainment systems. But the chips are all aimed at the same goal of helping automakers transform their vehicles into rolling computers that can be updated over the air with paid upgrades that generate revenue for carmakers long after a vehicle has left dealer lots, a business model pioneered by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm said it has reached a deal with Geely Holding-backed (GEELY.UL) brands Volvo and Polestar to use Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon Cockpit"" chips and an operating system from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google in vehicles starting later this year.

The deal will allow Volvo's electric SUV, which is to begin production this year, to tap into hands-free use of Google Assistant and navigation with Google Maps. The companies said that future upgrades will be sent out over the air.

Qualcomm also said that Honda will start using its ""cockpit"" chips in vehicles that will hit roads in 2023. Qualcomm also said Renault has agreed to use its automotive technology, but did not give specifics of which chips or when vehicles using them would arrive.

Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it has created a new chip and system for computer vision, which uses cameras on the car and artificial intelligence to help with safety functions like automatic lane control. The new ""Snapdragon Ride Vision System"" uses software from Arriver, which was part of Qualcomm's $4.5 billion purchase of automotive technology firm Veoneer Inc (VNE.N) last year.

Intel, clinging to its title of world's largest chipmaker by revenue, showed off graphics chips aimed at fighting Nvidia and AMD in their area of domination. Nvidia's latest chips are targeted at persuading more laptop owners to choose its highly specialized graphics capabilities, and AMD touted products meant to maintain its market share gains.

Qualcomm, the biggest maker of mobile-phone chips, bolstered its push to win a chunk of the personal-computer market, leveraging its strength in smartphone technology.

The flurry of announcements at the annual CES technology conference, based in Las Vegas but mostly taking place virtually, highlights the shifting competitive landscape for the group of companies whose technology rules the computer and mobile-phone industries. Intel's loss of leadership in chip-manufacturing technology has exposed it to challenges from newly confident rivals in the PC market. The company's response under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is to defend that market and, at the same time, to chase sales in its rivals' strongest businesses.

That fight will likely play out beyond 2022, with most analysts predicting Intel will struggle to boost sales this year, compared with revenue gains forecast for the other companies.

Still, on Tuesday, investors rewarded Intel's aggressive competitive posture. While chip stocks in general lost ground, Intel shares rose as much as 1.4%. Nvidia and AMD, which were among the best-performing stocks of 2021, each fell more than 5%. Qualcomm slid as much as 2.8%.

Read about the change in chip-delivery wait times for December

In an online presentation earlier in the day, Intel announced its 12th generation Core mobile processors, including 28 new models that are as much as 40% faster than their predecessors. Crucially, it also said new Arc graphics chips are being shipped to PC makers, including Acer Inc., Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc., which will use them in upcoming machines aimed at gamers.

The Arc chips are Intel's attempt to cut into the dominance of Nvidia and AMD in high-end graphics. More laptops are using add-in graphics cards to bolster capabilities in gaming and content creation, which are increasingly determining customer preferences. Intel's chips in the past have only offered graphics built into main microprocessors, typically with less power to generate realistic images.

Nvidia countered by unveiling new graphics chips for laptops, aimed at bringing high-end gaming and artificial intelligence capabilities to the thinnest and lightest computers.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics processor will equip notebooks that will be priced starting at $2,499, giving them better capabilities than many previous high-end desktop models, Nvidia said Tuesday in a virtual presentation. Laptop models running on the 3070 Ti chip will start at $1,499.

Nvidia, whose market value is larger than any other chipmaker, is rolling out new products as it works to broaden the reach of its technology into the laptop market. Most thin computers contain what's called integrated graphics, capabilities typically built into central processors from Intel or AMD.

Also as part of CES, AMD CEO Lisa Su showed off new laptop and graphics processors, meant to continue the company's run of stealing market share from Intel. AMD's graphics chips have come closer in performance to Nvidia's, but the larger company still controls the majority of the market for add-in cards for PC gamers that can cost more than $1,000.

And in one of the few remaining in-person appearances at CES, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke about his commitment to bringing smartphone technology-based processors to the PC market. He listed customers such as Microsoft Corp., Acer and Lenovo.

Qualcomm's chief also talked up his push into automotive semiconductors, unveiling chips that will help cars pilot themselves. That move will put him in more direct competition with Intel's Mobileye unit and Nvidia, which is also working to make chips to be the brains of vehicles of the future.","{'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}","[{'uri': 'ian_king@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Ian King', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i2yaXykkb7Uc/v1/1200x800.jpg,0.2392156862745098,,True,0.7921568751335144,0.2392156862745098,379025880,3

These four technological concepts include 5G wireless performance, automotive performance enhancements, metaverse XR goggles, and next-gen Arm PC CPUs. Qualcomm aims to bring Snapdragon Arm tech to Windows PCs across many collaborations, including Lenovo, Microsoft, Asus, and more. Nearly 200 enterprises, such as T-Mobile, Verizon, Cisco, and more, are either testing or deploying Windows on Snapdragon devices.

Qualcomm is likewise advancing its chipset production into areas of the metaverse with a custom AR Snapdragon chip. Microsoft is collaborating with the tech company to develop a glasses spec running on integrated software via both partners. These lightweight AR and VR goggles will utilize both Microsoft's Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces to broaden the metaverse concept.

In terms of 5G wireless connectivity, Qualcomm vies to bring wireless fiber to a global scale through a long-term focus. Qualcomm sees 5G and mmWave as ""a universal last mile technology."" The company is also collaborating with AT&T for, as the latter's CEO Jeff McElfresh relates, 5G wireless fiber ""connecting homes and businessess"" via ""direct broadband acceess.""

Qualcomm also seeks to reinvent automotive concepts with a Snapdragon digital chassis, which will be both multi-tier and multi-generational, as well as open and upgradable. The company is collaborating with both Volvo and Honda to redefine 21st-century driving.

Volvo and Qualcomm intend to integrate the Snapdragon technology into their SUV, releasing later this year. Qualcomm is bringing Snapdragon to vehicles via an AI cockpit platform with Honda. These fabrications with Honda will also be made available later this year.

Qualcomm is also bringing interesting technological prospects into everyday driving with in-cabin capabilities, such as e-mirrors for blindspot reduction, a ceiling display, and much more to improve upon safety for the automotive form.","{'uri': 'techtimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Tech Times'}","[{'uri': 'ryan_epps@techtimes.com', 'name': 'Ryan Epps', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/images/full/398643/qualcomm-snapdragon-press-event-ces-2022.jpg,,eng-7383810,False,0.6549019813537598,,379025880,6

The Galaxy S21 FE will be available in Australia from January 11 at $999 for the 128GB model and $1,099 for 256GB of storage. Our global news partner CNN was able to spend a weekend with the S21 FE, and after that time they are naming it a finalist for the Best Mobile Phone from CES 2022.

The Galaxy S21 FE looks familiar, though it is slightly larger than the S21, without flashy design elements like a metal border. It also has a camera bump that comes out of the phone's edge.

Samsung calls this a contour-cut frame and the subtle design provides uniformity on the back panel of the phone. The frame of the S21 FE is aluminium, though as might be expected with this more-affordable option, the phone's rear panel is a smooth polycarbonate. It isn't glossy but does show some fingerprints.

Weighing in at 177 grams, the S21 FE feels substantial in our hand, and it comes in olive, lavender, white or graphite colour options.

The device's front is nearly all screen, with a 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED panel, and it's nice to see minimal bezels all-around at this price point. We also appreciate how well it handles colours and supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother visuals than you'll see on many phones at this price.

Samsung's also tucked a 32-megapixel selfie camera into the top, which is great for video calls and quick shots. They've also included a fingerprint sensor built into the bottom half of the display.

Powering all of this is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, the same one that resides in the rest of the Galaxy S21 family. That means that photos are quick to process, games can be played locally or from the cloud, and multitasking is made easy with fluid movement between apps.

However, the RAM is lower than in other S21s and this could lead to slowdowns with more intense tasks or a bevy of apps open. The $699 S21 FE features 6GB of RAM (which we've been testing) and the $769 variant ships with 8GB. The S21 FE comes preloaded with Android 12 and Samsung's One UX 4.0.

Battery life has also been strong throughout the weekend, likely thanks to the 4,500mAh battery inside. We've easily gotten through a full day on a charge, even making it through two with lighter usage. When it comes time to charge, you'll need to plug in the included USB-C cable or place it on a Qi-enabled wireless charging pad. Samsung doesn't include a wall plug in the box, but we'd recommend an Anker Nano II.

While Samsung's S21 FE comes with a bigger battery and a faster processor inside, the same treatment was not given to the main camera array on the back. Here's what the Galaxy S21 FE is packing.

Samsung's various modes are also included here -- Night Mode, Single Take, Portrait, Pro, Food, Portrait Video, Dual Recording and Slow Motion, among others, and they all run well (samples below). Single take is still one of our favourites, letting you hit the shutter button and move the phone around, then the S21 FE uses AI to figure out which shots to capture and whether it needs to apply effects.

Camera performance here will be critical since the Pixel 6 also costs $999 and offers excellent photography. You lose the physical telephoto lens there, but Google's processing is second to none in the Android space.

Samsung's Galaxy S21 FE is shaping up to be an excellent new entry point into the Galaxy S21 family.

However, it's launching at an interesting time, as we're just a few weeks away from the rumoured successors to the Galaxy S21 family, aka the Galaxy S22. Still, for those who want a more affordable Samsung device, the $999 S21 FE will likely fit the bill -- as long as you're cool with a cheaper design and not the most impressive telephoto lens.

The Galaxy S21 FE is also making a splash at CES as one of the few mobile phones to launch at the show. For its feature set and affordable positioning, it's a finalist for Best Mobile Phone of CES 2022. We'll be sharing our full finalists later this week, ahead of the top picks in each category.

You can purchase the Galaxy S21 FE at $999 for 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM, or $1,099 for 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM.

Either way, you'll find support for 5G mmWave and Sub-6 as well, which is terrific news -- especially if either network exists near you. Those seeking ultra-fast speeds that can rival home networks will want to find mmWave connectivity.

We'd also recommend looking at the standard Galaxy S21 or if you're fine without a telephoto lens, the similarly priced Pixel 6.","{'uri': '7news.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': '7NEWS.com.au'}","[{'uri': 'jacob_krol@7news.com.au', 'name': 'Jacob Krol', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-5188130/d8966ea26fe3820db264a4237241d5ca168912c4-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200,0.1607843137254903,eng-7377109,False,0.8627451062202454,0.1607843137254903,379025700,1

The two are partnering on a string of initiatives to foster augmented reality and the metaverse, including the development of custom chips for AR glasses. The companies were shy on the nature of the chips or the end products, but they promised ""lightweight,"" energy-efficient wearables. You might actually want to use this eyewear for extended periods, in other words.

The team-up will unsurprisingly make use of software, including Microsoft's Mesh virtual collaboration tool and Qualcomm's Snapdragon Spaces XR development system. There wasn't any mention of what platforms the glasses would support, although it's safe to presume they'll be Windows-friendly.

An alliance like this doesn't come as a complete shock. Microsoft has long discussed plans to make AR more accessible than its work-oriented HoloLens headsets. These chips won't necessarily reach consumer-oriented glasses, but they could represent a large step in that direction. For Qualcomm, this could also help it control the future of AR -- it might not have to worry that Meta and other companies will dominate the metaverse and dictate its terms.","{'uri': 'finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

Today during the company's CES 2022 conference, Qualcomm revealed that it is working with Renault Group to develop more smart cars with its Snapdragon 'Digital Chassis' technology package.

Renault Group is one of the largest automobile manufacturers in the world (it ranked 9th globally in 2016 in volume of cars sold). The company already has a few cars with Android Automotive, such as the latest Mégane E-TECH Electric, but now the company is working closely with Qualcomm on more integrated hardware.

Qualcomm said in its announcement, ""with the aim to build a next-generation architecture that focuses on extensible and flexible vehicle architectures that are focused on addressing the evolving consumer and enterprise customer expectations, Renault Group will work with Qualcomm Technologies to leverage the Snapdragon Digital Chassis to equip upcoming Renault vehicles with the latest connected and intelligent solutions for its next generation vehicles.""

The 'Digital Chassis' is a package of software and hardware products developed by Qualcomm, including network connectivity (5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, vehicle-to-everything/V2X, precise positioning, and power line communications), cockpit software, driver assistance, and a 'Car2Cloud' services platform. Qualcomm says Car2Cloud allows a car to have over-the-air updates and... subscription service options. Hopefully Renault isn't planning a Toyota-like key fob remote subscription.

While Qualcomm already offered a System-on-a-Chip designs for cars (in the form of the Snapdragon Cockpit Platform), which is already used by the Mégane E-TECH Electric, the Digital Chassis is a more complete package that will show up in some future cars. Essentially, Qualcomm wants to handle all the ""smart stuff"" for car manufacturers, leaving companies like Renault to just worry about the rest of the vehicle.","{'uri': 'xda-developers.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'XDA-Developers'}","[{'uri': 'corbin_davenport@xda-developers.com', 'name': 'Corbin Davenport', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/11/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-logo-featured.jpg,0.2313725490196079,eng-7383748,False,0.7176470756530762,0.2313725490196079,379024860,6

The new platform also comes with support for both of the companies' AR and mixed reality platforms, Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces, bringing the two technologies together for the first time.

This partnership comes as both companies have been increasingly investing in AR and XR. Microsoft introduced Mesh in early 2021, while Qualcomm announced Snapdragon Spaces towards the end of the year. Microsoft has released two iterations of the HoloLens AR headset at this point, and the HoloLens 2 was powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 chip. However, Microsoft also built its custom processor, called HPU, to handle the AR-related tasks, so it wasn't just Qualcomm hardware doing the work.

During its press conference, Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon specifically said that the chipset is for ""next-generation lightweight glasses"". Amon also stated that the processor will be power efficient, which is important for a head-worn device like this. Hopefully, all of this means we'll see even smaller headsets in the future, and hopefully, we'll get closer to a consumer-focused product. So far, Microsoft's HoloLens has catered pretty much exclusively to business users and developers.

""This collaboration reflects the next step in both companies' shared commitment to XR and the metaverse,"" said Hugo Swart, vice president and general manager of XR, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. ""Qualcomm Technologies' core XR strategy has always been delivering the most cutting-edge technology, purpose-built XR chipsets and enabling the ecosystem with our software platforms and hardware reference designs. We are thrilled to work with Microsoft to help expand and scale the adoption of AR hardware and software across the entire industry.""

Aside from integrating Snapdragon Spaces into Microsoft Mesh, Qualcomm didn't have a lot more to say about this new AR chip. It seems like the partnership may still be in early stages, or maybe a new device will be announced sometime soon. It's also not completely clear whether this new chip means Microsoft will no longer be making a separate holographic processor (HPU), or if the new chip will work alongside it.

The HoloLens 2 was first revealed at MWC in February 2019, so it's nearly three years old at this point. That's about how long it took for Microsoft to introduce the HoloLens 2 after the first iteration. Plus, MWC 2022 is planned to take place in a couple of months, so it seems like as good a time as any for a new version of the headset.","{'uri': 'xda-developers.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'XDA-Developers'}","[{'uri': 'joao_carrasqueira@xda-developers.com', 'name': 'João Carrasqueira', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/01/Microsoft-Qualcomm-AR-chip-announcement-1.jpg,0.2313725490196079,eng-7383810,False,0.8588235378265381,0.2313725490196079,379024860,6

The company just released the January 2022 Android Security Update Bulletin, though the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will have to wait a bit longer.

Perhaps the most important non-security change in this update is a system-level fix for the bug that allowed Microsoft Teams to break emergency calling, known as CVE-2021-39659. Microsoft already rolled out a fix for its Android application, but this security patch addresses it for good.

This update also patches a loophole in Android 12 that allowed third-party applications with shell access to change the colors and dimensions of certain system elements, which in turn permitted some system customization without root access or other device modifications. The issue was already fixed in the developer builds of Android 12L, but Google has now backported the fix back to Android 12.

The January 2022 Android Security Bulletin can be viewed here. The core 2022-01-01 security patch covers five vulnerabilities in the Android Framework and Media Framework, and 11 issues for the core Android System. The additional 2022-01-05 security patch contains one fix for the Android runtime and four for the kernel, as well as a handful of fixes specific to certain chipsets from Qualcomm, MediaTek, and other chipmakers.

For more information on how the monthly Android security update process works, we recommend reading our explainer available here.

The January security update with patch level 2022-01-05 is rolling out for the Pixel 3a series, Pixel 4 series, Pixel 4a series, Pixel 5, and Pixel 5a. The update is not yet ready for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro -- Google paused the rollout of the buggy December update for the Pixel 6 series, and the company said a new update with all the fixes (and the January security patches) wouldn't arrive until later in January.

If you don't want to wait for Google to push the update to you, you can manually flash it to your device using either the OTA files (if you're on the previous update already) or the factory images (if you're behind on updates, or want to switch back to the stock ROM). The links to both options are below.

She is the author of Microsoft 2.

Microsoft and Qualcomm plan to develop together custom augmented-reality chips that can be used in future lightweight AR glasses, the pair announced at CES on January 4. Microsoft and Qualcomm also announced plans to integrate their AR software, namely Microsoft Mesh and the Snapdragon Spaces XR (Mixed Reality) Developer Platform.

The two companies are positioning these developments as yet more ways they will be participating in the metaverse -- a vaguely defined term that some use as shorthand for AR/XR and others, more broadly, as a synonym for Web3 (whatever that is).

According to Qualcomm's press release about the planned collaboration, the two will be working on AR in both the consumer and enterprise sectors. Recently, Microsoft has been largely focusing its AR/XR deliverables, as well as its metaverse pitch, on the enterprise sector. Qualcomm also has talked up its vision for IoT Next as one way it plans to participate in the metaverse.

Microsoft has partnered in the past with Qualcomm to develop custom SQ1 and SQ2 chips for its ARM-based Surface Pro X devices. Many AR/XR headsets such as Meta/Facebook's Oculus Quest, as well as the HoloLens 2, are built with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips. Microsoft also has continued to work with Qualcomm to try to build momentum for Arm-based Windows PCs, but that effort hasn't gone very far in terms of customer mindshare or industry market share.

Microsoft Mesh, for those needing a quick refresher, is the company's mixed-reality platform powered by Azure that is meant to create a sense of shared presence on a variety of devices. Microsoft talked up Mesh at its Build developer conference last spring. In the fall, Microsoft announced plans to bring Mesh to its Teams group-collaboration platform.","{'uri': 'zdnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ZDNet'}","[{'uri': 'mary_jo_foley@zdnet.com', 'name': 'Mary Jo Foley', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/241347064e587cd2bbb725a5b3d668c51e964300/2022/01/04/73b44c10-42c8-4eb4-92ed-89c29fe96ada/microsoftqualcommchipsar.jpg?width=770&height=578&fit=crop&auto=webp,0.05098039215686279,eng-7383810,False,0.8352941274642944,0.05098039215686279,379024860,5

Both prosecutors and defense attorneys had recommended home confinement for Yisroel Goldstein, citing his leadership in the weeks following the 2019 attack on Chabad of Poway, the immense physical and emotional trauma the former rabbi continues to battle, and his cooperation in the FBI's fraud investigation.

But the judge rejected that punishment as not appropriate given the seriousness of the crimes.

""You not only committed this offense yourself but you took a lot of people with you,"" U.S. District Court Judge Cynthia Bashant told Goldstein, 60.

""It's important to send a message to the community and important to send a message to you,"" she added.

Goldstein must also pay about $2.8 million in restitution, an amount shared with several other defendants who were prosecuted as participants in the financial cons.

He must self-surrender by Feb. 23, although he could appeal for a later date if COVID-19 continues to surge. The judge agreed to recommend he be housed at a medium-security federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., which his defense attorney said is known to accommodate observant Jews.

As a rabbi in the Chabad movement -- which practices Orthodox Judaism but is also known for its welcoming nature -- Goldstein counted on the generosity of his congregation for his salary. He found other ways to supplement his income.

The FBI says Goldstein had his hand in a number of fraudulent schemes exploiting tax loopholes, corporate benevolence and government grant assistance.

Prosecutors said he personally earned at least $620,000 from the conspiracies.

The most prevalent of the schemes is known as the ""90/10"" fraud. Donors regularly made large charitable contributions to Chabad of Poway or one of its affiliated nonprofits, to be written off their taxes. But instead of the money going to the organizations, Goldstein secretly funneled 90 percent of it back to the donor, keeping 10 percent for himself. One donor got his donation returned in the form of $1 million in gold, prosecutors said.

At least a dozen people took Goldstein up on the tax-evasion scheme, resulting in at least $1.5 million in tax losses to the IRS, according to prosecutors.

In one variation on the scheme, donors would solicit their companies for matching charitable contributions. Goldstein would then return all of the original amount to the donor while keeping the corporation's matching funds. The corporations were given fraudulent donation receipts, and many took the tax deductions.

At least three Fortune 500 companies, including Qualcomm, were defrauded out of nearly $145,000 total.

In a letter to the judge and further statements in court, Goldstein expressed deep remorse.

""I beg for mercy to accept my repentance and allow me to right the wrongs and be able to live out the rest of my life with remorse and to be given the chance to do whatever I can to help others to the best of my ability,"" he told the judge Tuesday.

Goldstein, who first launched the synagogue in Rancho Bernardo in the 1980s, was long known as a leader in the local Jewish community. But he became an international figure, delivering a powerful message against hate, when he and three members of his congregation were shot in an anti-Semitic attack on April 27, 2019. One, Lori Gilbert-Kaye, whom he described in court as like a sister, was killed.

The gunman, John T. Earnest, 22, was recently sentenced to two life terms in prison on both state and federal charges.

Bullets struck the rabbi in both hands, causing him to lose a finger and leaving another severely injured.

Still, in the hours and days after the attack he delivered words of hope -- from an impromptu speech while standing on a chair right after the shooting to appearances at the White House and United Nations.

No one knew at the time that he was the subject of a fraud investigation that had been open for more than a year.

Goldstein stepped down as rabbi in November 2019, citing exhaustion. News of his crimes wasn't made public until the following summer, when he pleaded guilty to tax and wire fraud.","{'uri': 'sandiegouniontribune.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'San Diego Union-Tribune'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/306a5d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3038+0+281/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff2%2Fd5%2Fd02ff2fb4ebf846f3194ac1a137f%2Fsd-photos-1staff-895191-sd-me-rabbi-sentencing-ncc-001.jpg,-0.1686274509803921,eng-7383773,False,0.8196078538894653,-0.1686274509803921,379024800,1

Qualcomm Corp. on Tuesday announced deals to supply chips to automakers Volvo Group, Honda Motor Co. and Renault, accelerating its push to partner with legacy automotive firms digitizing their product lines.

The company once known for its mobile phone chips has created a range of automotive offerings, from self-driving car brains to chips that operate digital dashboards and infotainment systems. But the chips are all aimed at the same goal of helping automakers transform their vehicles into rolling computers that can be updated over the air with paid upgrades that generate revenue for carmakers long after a vehicle has left dealer lots, a business model pioneered by Tesla Inc.

At the CES 2022 show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm said it has reached a deal with Geely Holding-backed brands Volvo and Polestar to use Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon Cockpit"" chips and an operating system from Alphabet Inc's Google in vehicles starting later this year.

The deal will allow Volvo's electric crossover, which is to begin production this year, to tap into hands-free use of Google Assistant and navigation with Google Maps. The companies said that future upgrades will be sent out over the air.

Qualcomm also said that Honda will start using its ""cockpit"" chips in vehicles that will hit roads in 2023.

Qualcomm also said Renault has agreed to use its automotive technology, but did not give specifics of which chips or when vehicles using them would arrive.

These new mobile CPUs use the same ""Alder Lake"" hybrid architecture previously seen on the chipmaker's 12th gen desktop CPUs, with a new Intel Thread Director technology that optimizes workflows across performance cores and efficient cores.

The chipmaker revealed no less than 28 new 12th Gen mobile chips today, with the flagship Core i12900HK which according to Intel is ""the fastest mobile processor ever and the world's best mobile gaming platform."" With 14 CPU cores with a 5GHz maximum Turbo frequency and 20 threads, Intel promises up to 28% faster gaming performance compared to the Core i911980HK, as well as up to 43% higher performance in 3D rendering gen-over-gen.

Intel's 12th Gen H-series mobile CPUs led by the Core i9-12900HK also support future-proof technologies including DDR5/LPDDR5 and DDR4/LPDDR4 modules up to 4800 MT/s, WiFi 6E, and Thunderbolt 4. Intel is also launching 12th Gen U-series chips for thin-an-light laptops with up to 14 cores, 20 threads, and Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics. The company also has new 12th Gen P-series chips for thinner laptops, foldables, 2 and 1s, and other form factors.

For desktop PCs, Intel also unveiled today 22 new 12th Gen CPUs including Core i9, Pentium, and Celeron chips. The company also announced that its new Arc high-performance discrete GPUs will soon be found in more than 50 new mobile and desktop devices from partners including Lenovo, HP, Samsung, Asus, and Acer.

It won't be easy to compete with heavyweights Nvidia and AMD, but Intel's dedicated GPUs will support hardware-accelerated Ray Tracing, AI-powered upscaling with the company's Xe Super Sampling technology, as well as Intel Deep Link, a technology that can optimize workloads across Intel CPUs and GPUs.

Intel wasn't the only company to announce new products at CES today, as AMD preceded it with its impressive Ryzen 6000 mobile CPUs. Nvidia also revealed new GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs for laptops and desktop PCs today, while Qualcomm has also detailed its new Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 and 7c+ Gen 3 compute platforms.

(NASDAQ:QCOM) is down 1.4% to trade at $183.64 this afternoon. The security has had a few volatile weeks on the charts, though it did score a Dec. 16, all-time high of $192.68. Shares have since cooled from that peak, and are now testing a floor at the $181 level. The good news is that QCOM's pullback has placed the equity near a trendline with historically bullish implications, which could lead to more record highs in the coming weeks.

The trendline in question is the equity's 40-day moving average. QCOM is now within just one standard deviation of it, after spending nearly two months above this trendline. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, six similar signals were observed over the last three years. QCOM enjoyed a positive return one month later after all of these signals, averaging a significant 10.9% gain. From its current perch, a comparable move would place the stock at a fresh record high of $203.65.

The brokerage bunch is already bullish towards Qualcomm stock. Of the 35 analysts in question, 25 call it a ""buy"" or better, while the other 10 carry a ""hold"" rating. Plus, the 12-month consensus target price of $208.50 is a 13.4% premium to QCOM's current perch.

The options pits echo that optimism. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), QCOM sports a 50-day call/put volume ratio of 4.27, which stands in the 99th percentile of its annual range.

The two are partnering on a string of initiatives to foster augmented reality and the metaverse, including the development of custom chips for AR glasses. The companies were shy on the nature of the chips or the end products, but they promised ""lightweight,"" energy-efficient wearables. You might actually want to use this eyewear for extended periods, in other words.

The team-up will unsurprisingly make use of software, including Microsoft's Mesh virtual collaboration tool and Qualcomm's Snapdragon Spaces XR development system. There wasn't any mention of what platforms the glasses would support, although it's safe to presume they'll be Windows-friendly.

An alliance like this doesn't come as a complete shock. Microsoft has long discussed plans to make AR more accessible than its work-oriented HoloLens headsets. These chips won't necessarily reach consumer-oriented glasses, but they could represent a large step in that direction. For Qualcomm, this could also help it control the future of AR -- it might not have to worry that Meta and other companies will dominate the metaverse and dictate its terms.","{'uri': 'engadget.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'engadget'}",[],https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b5b5b5b0-47da-11ec-85bb-84204db1702a,0.1686274509803922,eng-7383810,False,0.7137255072593689,0.1686274509803922,379024140,2

When they debuted in late 2019, the AirPods Pro already redefined the true wireless earbuds market, with premium features like Active Noise Cancellation and an in-ear design not previously seen on such small earbuds.

So, it may not be all that surprising that Apple aims to do the same with the second-generation of its AirPods Pro, with well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo telling investors that Apple plans to make them the first earbuds to support Apple Lossless audio, as well as packing in the sort of health sensors we've been hearing about for a couple of years now.

Kuo also mentioned the possible inclusion of health sensors in December, although at the time he suggested that they could be more fitness-oriented, covering things like motion tracking for workouts. However, in this week's investor note, Kuo hinted at more health monitoring features, although he was a bit vague on whether these would make it into this year's AirPods Pro.

Kuo's comments about support for the Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) are new, however, although they shouldn't come as a huge surprise. As we noted last week, Apple is clearly aiming to break beyond the current limitations of Bluetooth, and while it's not entirely clear how it plans to do this with the AirPods Pro, we have absolutely no doubt that Apple is working on it.

Notably, however, what Kuo is talking about here isn't simply a better Bluetooth codec, like LDAC, aptX Lossless, or the AAC Scalable to Lossless (AAC-SLS) extension. Although it seems like AAC-SLS is the direction Apple would most likely go in if it were to try to get near-lossless quality over Bluetooth, Kuo's sources say that Apple plans to blow right past that and go straight for the full Apple Lossless Audio experience.

ALAC is what Apple uses to stream Lossless Audio over AirPlay 2, which in turn runs over Wi-Fi. While on the surface this could suggest that Apple may plan to use Wi-Fi in the second-generation AirPods Pro, that's not necessarily the only way that the company could go. In fact, standard Wi-Fi technology is poorly suited to the kind of point-to-point connections used by headphones.

However, there are other Wi-Fi standards available that could be suited to this purpose, including 802.11ay, which Apple has reportedly been working on. The downside to any of these approaches, however, is that Apple would create a situation with the AirPods Pro where Lossless Audio would only be supported from the very newest devices that also support the same obscure or proprietary wireless standards.

It's worth noting that Bluetooth technically does offer the bandwidth to support ALAC, as the codec uses lossless compression that allows it to deliver lossless quality at bitrates as low as 500kbps. The same is true with Qualcomm's new aptX Lossless codec, which, unlike Sony's LDAC, is supposed to provide audio streaming that's bit-for-bit identical to the source -- which is the very definition of ""lossless audio.""

So, if Qualcomm can do it, then it's fair to say that Apple can pull this off as well. The problem, however, is that this still requires the kind of Bluetooth bandwidth that's available only under nearly perfect conditions.

That means very close proximity between the AirPods and the source device, and nothing else in the area that could cause interference. That second part can be a bigger challenge, considering that Bluetooth runs in the same 2.4GHz spectrum as everything from Wi-Fi networks and cordless phones to microwave ovens and garage door openers.

It seems unlikely that Apple will ditch Bluetooth entirely from any version of the AirPods, as they still need to remain compatible with older iPhones and other Bluetooth devices. However, it's not hard to imagine Apple working to improve or extend the existing Bluetooth protocols to better deal with interference and range issues.

At the end of the day, however, it's hard to imagine that anybody will be able to hear true lossless audio quality on the AirPods Pro. While pushing the bitrates above the current 256kbps AAC could certainly make a difference for some folks, there's a law of diminishing returns as you actually approach the threshold of true lossless audio.

So, if Apple does truly deliver ALAC on the next-generation AirPods Pro, we're going to have to chalk this one up to a combination of marketing and a certain level of ""because they can"" engineering on the part of Apple's Acoustics Team.

Kuo notes that the second-generation AirPods Pro will also include some more practical improvements, to be found in the charging case.

Firstly, it looks like Apple will finally add full AirTag-like capabilities to the AirPods case. We've been suspecting this would come for a while, but despite the ability to use Find My with AirPods in iOS 15, they're still more limited than a standalone AirTag.

According to Kuo, the next AirPods Pro will address this, right down to including a set of speakers in the AirPods case so that they can emit a sound to help users find them. This lines up with some of the leaked photos we've seen, which show speaker grilles at the bottom of the case.

Contrary to some speculation that suggested that Apple might allow the AirPods Pro case to actually play music, it's much more reasonable to assume that these will be used exclusively for sounding alerts, although these may not be limited solely to Find My tracking.

By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) - Qualcomm Corp on Tuesday announced deals to supply chips to automakers Volvo Group, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Renault SA, accelerating its push to partner with legacy automotive firms digitizing their product lines.

The San Diego, California, company once known for its mobile phone chips has created a range of automotive offerings, from self-driving car brains to chips that operate digital dashboards and infotainment systems. But the chips are all aimed at the same goal of helping automakers transform their vehicles into rolling computers that can be updated over the air with paid upgrades that generate revenue for carmakers long after a vehicle has left dealer lots, a business model pioneered by Tesla Inc.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm said it has reached a deal with Geely Holding-backed brands Volvo and Polestar to use Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon Cockpit"" chips and an operating system from Alphabet Inc's Google in vehicles starting later this year.

The deal will allow Volvo's electric SUV, which is to begin production this year, to tap into hands-free use of Google Assistant and navigation with Google Maps. The companies said that future upgrades will be sent out over the air.

Qualcomm also said that Honda will start using its ""cockpit"" chips in vehicles that will hit roads in 2023. Qualcomm also said Renault has agreed to use its automotive technology, but did not give specifics of which chips or when vehicles using them would arrive.

Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it has created a new chip and system for computer vision, which uses cameras on the car and artificial intelligence to help with safety functions like automatic lane control.

Interview Chip technologies from Arm and x86 are getting the most attention amid semiconductor shortages and trade wars. But in the background, the open-source RISC-V chip architecture is stealthily emerging as a viable third architecture that is cheaper, flexible, and free of political intrigue.

RISC-V is often referred to as the Linux of chips with engineers collaborating to design, set, and improve the architecture. RISC-V International sets the spec, which is free to license, and chip designers are free to implement it as they see fit in their processors and system-on-chips.

China and Europe are moving to RISC-V for homegrown silicon to achieve chip sovereignty. Companies are also looking at RISC-V to cut licensing and royalty costs associated with the Arm and x86 architectures.

To be sure, it may be many years until RISC-V emerges as a viable alternative to x86 and Arm in PCs, servers, and mobile phones. But it is off to a good start in microcontrollers and FPGAs, and single-board computers with RISC-V are already available. It also has the backing of companies including Google, Apple, Amazon, Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Nvidia.

People are doing things that they couldn't with other architectures before RISC-V. It's free. It's flexible. They don't have to pay anybody extra money to customize it. We take advantage of the community and stuff that's very common. We break down corporate barriers, country barriers, cultural barriers, time-zone barriers, and we all share that piece because we are part of this community.

You can innovate in a particular area where we allow for non-standard extensions. It's kind of the best of both worlds.

What are the challenges you face as an open-source chip effort?

It's not like we're dictating like Arm and x86. I ran Solaris for Sun. I've run other big organizations. You tell people what to do. You set a goal and then you go do it. Here, we're making sure we have something coherent that the members can use, and moving forward is important.

We're introducing two concepts, one called profiles and the other common platforms. This is to reduce fragmentation. Profiles are a group of instructions that work together, just like you see generational stuff and other architectures. And those are the things that will tell the upstream projects like compilers and optimizers as well as the distros, ""Hey, target this profile, this is the application profile for 2022. These instructions work together."" The same thing we're doing for operating systems, so a bunch of things around platforms like discovery, ACPI, SPI.

We've had a whole bunch of individual extensions, and you could either adopt them or not, but there wasn't a whole group where we said, ""Look, in this generation these all work together. In this generation, these operating system components, these all work together."" [In 2021] we had those. Those are new, and that's very exciting. We're not done. That's in order to make sure we're not duplicating effort, share as much as we can and don't fragment as a community.

We're still learning how contributor culture works in an instruction set architecture, because some of it is architects who are defining this ISA, but has to do with fostering the software ecosystem. We have to make sure that compilers, libraries, operating systems are there, and we're still learning how to do that.

What's coming up for RISC-V?

We had a big backlog and we're knocking that out. The next thing is setting the stage for the next-generation stuff. For example, both our AI-ML special interest group and our graphics special interest group are both interested in advanced matrix operations. That will probably start being under development in 2022. A lot of stuff sits in accelerators, but not in core architectures. You're going to see some of that stuff start going up.

Google just became a premium premier member. Amazon's working on Greengrass. Not to mention Seagate, Western Digital, Nvidia, Huawei, Alibaba. People who produce real products are putting out real numbers - hundreds of millions of cores based on RISC-V in 2021.

Are you chasing GPUs? I think people are just wondering about gaming on RISC-V. Gaming is getting better on Linux.

We're not necessarily going after GPUs. We go after workloads. We have a bunch of members who want the same thing. ""Let's go ahead and figure out what it would take to be successful in graphics on RISC-V, prioritize the work and try to get additional stuff done first."" People running the special interest group or in graphics said shading is most important. In order to do shading, you need matrix operations. At the same time, the ML guys are coming back and going, ""In order to do these ML operations, I need matrix operations."" We are combining that effort.

What's the difference between RISC-V and other open-source chip efforts like OpenSPARC or OpenPower?

If the companies behind them went away, they disappear. They can't stand on their own.

If you look at Linux, there were a lot of other operating systems that were open source at the time. Why was [Linux] successful? Part of it was Linus [Torvalds]. The second thing is, people felt they owned it. It wasn't shoved on them. They own Linux. Same thing is going to happen with RISC-V. People feel they own RISC-V, they're helping make it.

Is there any kind of interest in support for Windows on RISC-V? What about Android?

I talked to somebody from Microsoft. They're not there yet. But they're in a bunch of Linux Foundation things. When we get in the room, all we want to do is be good engineers. Is Windows in RISC-V's future? Probably. Is it sometime soon? Probably not.

It's a lot easier to talk about all the variants of Linux - Zephyr, FreeRTOS, Alpine - all the things that you see in the open-source world are going to go first. It's easy for people to port them, and because the tool chains are the same and so on. We've set the structure to be able to support Windows in the future. But again, it really depends on what the community wants. That's where we spend our time and money.

Android 10 is there, [RISC-V members] are working on Android 12. In the end, Google makes money out of the Google Play Store. Until some handset manufacturer says we're doing it, [RISC-V] will be a second-class citizen. That's the way it works. And we don't feel bad about that. Google's now a premier member - we certainly have talked to them about Android and it just takes time for this ecosystem.

More non-tech industries like automotive are taking chip development in their own hands. Where does RISC-V fit in?

I don't think [chip development] is for the meek at heart. I think you will see people partnering up with RISC-V IP providers, like SiFive or Andes. A bunch of these companies will take your requests and design something for you. Or they'll give you the IP so you can burn it on an FPGA. There's been a renaissance in EDA tools, so it's easier to create an FPGA with a RISC-V processor, or something doing some specialized processing and to pump out an FPGA. That's a lot less daunting.

There are lots of people who want to get involved in RISC-V, but actually need samples of the chip.

Let's separate out the problem. There are some who need real hardware in order to even develop their system or their chip because they need to experiment. From that perspective, this year is a big inflection point because there's a half a dozen or more development boards out there. We've started a seed program, we're trying to give 1,000 boards out to academics, early adopters and distros by June 2022.

We have the RISC-V Exchange on the RISC-V website. There's a bunch of discrete chips, SOCs, boards, software services, that anybody can take advantage of today.

RISC-V is about cutting costs. Are you arranging for RISC-V chips manufactured at low cost?

We're talking about boards, you're talking about chips. We're always working on adding more people into the Exchange. I'm always working on recruiting people. Do we have everybody who's providing RISC-V services? They're absolutely not. Do we have a bunch there already? Absolutely. Will we continue to attract people and add more people in? Yes. RISC-V Exchange is also getting tags so you'll be able to search some of those entries and find what you really want.

Can you cost out a RISC-V chip versus x86 and Arm?

From a cost perspective, it doesn't matter which one you're doing, you have to pay for silicon. That's not going to change. Very clearly places like x86, like Intel, you're paying for both the design and for the chip.

Then you have fabless guys, they will sell you a design and they're going to go to some foundry, potentially one that they have a relationship with, and you're going to negotiate based on volume. That's not going to change. It's going to cost you.

I can't tell you that ""here's what it cost to deploy this particular part in this particular industry if you're using Arm versus RISC-V versus x86."" It's too complicated.

I suggest you look back at Linux as the example here. Is it cheaper to ship Linux than AIX? How do you do that pricing? I think there are just other attributes of Linux that attract people to using it. It's the feeling they're not going to ever feel out of control. There's a feeling they can influence the product and industry. The same thing is true around RISC-V. ®","{'uri': 'theregister.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'theregister.com'}",[],https://regmedia.co.uk/2018/11/27/shutterstock_69317677.jpg,0.2,,False,0,0.2,379023120,1

The new partnership was announced at Qualcomm's CES 2022 keynote.

""We're announcing that we're developing a custom augmented reality Snapdragon chip for next-generation, power-efficient, very lightweight AR glasses for the Microsoft ecosystem,"" said Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon. ""And we're integrating into that chip platform software from both companies: the Microsoft Mesh platform, and the recently announced Qualcomm Snapdragon Spaces XR development platform. Snapdragon Spaces will be fully integrated into Microsoft Mesh, and this platform will be available for next-generation lightweight glasses.""

The partnership isn't too surprising: Qualcomm's Snapdragon 850 chip already powers Microsoft's HoloLens 2 headset from 2019. And Qualcomm has only increased its focus and its development of more specifically AR and VR focused chips in recent years, including the Snapdragon XR2 that powers the Oculus Quest 2. Microsoft and Qualcomm have also worked together on bespoke chips in the past, like the Surface Pro X's customized SQ1 and SQ2 processors.

The inclusion of support for both Microsoft Mesh and Qualcomm's Snapdragon Spaces XR platform is particularly notable, too. Both platforms offer interesting mixed reality use cases that span multiple devices. Mesh already has a cross-platform VR / AR system for connecting between virtual reality headsets, tablets, smartphones, and PCs, while Spaces aims to specifically integrate Qualcomm-powered smartphones as a ""second screen"" for mixed reality experiences. And given that Qualcomm specifically highlighted the upcoming chip collaboration as focusing on ultra-light augmented reality glasses, it seems clear that the two companies have big ambitions for integrating future projects into a broader, connected digital world.","{'uri': 'theverge.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Verge'}","[{'uri': 'chaim_gartenberg@theverge.com', 'name': 'Chaim Gartenberg', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D5CcAop8JQ8Lqgq1px3Mc7FyvN4=/3x0:2427x1212/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145165/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_2.16.47_PM.png,0.1529411764705881,eng-7383810,False,0.8235294222831726,0.1529411764705881,379023060,6

The company has unveiled a Snapdragon Ride Vision platform that combines a 4-nanometer system-on-chip with Arriver's computer vision software to give automakers an ""open, scalable and modular"" way to build Level 2 driver assists and Level 3 partial autonomy into their cars.

Snapdragon Ride Vision can help cars detect road geometry, pedestrians and other cars using 8MP wide-angle cameras. It can also handle driver monitoring (to keep your hands or eyes focused on driving) and perception for near-field parking cameras. More importantly, the system is flexible -- car designers can customize it to fit new vehicles and update features over the air.

The platform won't be ready for vehicle production until 2024. That's a long time to wait, particularly when Intel's Mobileye and NVIDIA are teasing chips capable of full self-driving. Still, Qualcomm might have an edge simply by making automated driving features more accessible. Snapdragon Ride Vision works with ""virtually all"" car price ranges and categories, Qualcomm said -- this could be key to semi-autonomy in cars where the tech was previously impractical.","{'uri': 'finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

Affordable 5G smartphones are on the rise, and AT&T has thrown itself into the mix with its latest smartphone launch. The Fusion 5G may not be the most robust offering out there, but it does come with a few notable features that are hard to beat at this price.

The first is wireless charging. You'll be hard-pressed to find a smartphone at this price with wireless charging, even among the best Android phones under $300. And while it's not exactly a must-have feature, it's a nice one to have for those of you that have wireless chargers lying around the house.

AT&T doesn't specify the wireless charging speed, but don't expect it to break any records. However, the carrier does mention a ""quick charging battery"" and an included fast-charging adapter to top up the 4750mAh battery.

Interestingly, AT&T has managed to squeeze in mmWave 5G support into a sub-$300 price, which is pretty rare. MmWave is normally reserved for pricier smartphones due to the extra hardware required. Not only that but AT&T's mmWave rollout hasn't been quite as robust as Verizon, for instance, but either way you look at it, the spectrum isn't exactly easy to come by, even in cities where it's available.

Still, with mmWave support, the Fusion 5G will have access to some of the fastest speeds available. That, along with wireless charging, gives it an edge over T-Mobile's similarly affordable REVVL V+. Besides that, specs are fairly par-for-the-course for a phone under $300, with a 6.82-inch HD+ display, 48MP quad-camera array, rear fingerprint sensor, and Android 11 out-of-the-box.

Having access to mmWave at this price point has been Qualcomm's goal as of late, with the company partnering with carriers and OEMs worldwide to help boost global adoption of the technology. This may be among the first steps towards getting mmWave in more hands, although it would be a bit more exciting if mmWave signal was available in more places.

The Fusion 5G will be available for purchase on Friday, January 7 for just $220.","{'uri': 'androidcentral.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Central'}",[],https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2022/01/att-fusion-5g.jpg,0.1607843137254903,,False,0,0.1607843137254903,379021680,1

Qualcomm announced new efforts in its automotive technology plans during CES 2022. That includes Snapdragon Digital Chassis, which will offer car makers a way to expand the tech available for vehicle owners.

An example feature includes the Snapdragon Ride Platform for better assisted and automated driving features. Another example is the Snapdragon Cockpit Platform, which will allow cars to include advanced multi-display and multi-camera interiors, with high-end audio and video features.

Other Digital Chassis features include the Snapdragon Auto Connectivity Platform, which will allow cars to connect to other devices and cloud servers via LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Also, Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud Services will support updating cars with new features and upgrades via cloud connections.

Snapdragon Digital Chassis has already received support from a number of carmakers.

Starting at $699, the tech giant's new fan edition flagship smartphone offers the best features of the Galaxy 21 for less.

If you're due for an upgrade and want to save even more, you'll find the best Galaxy S21 FE deals at T-Mobile and Sprint. Whether you're a new or existing customer, you can get yourself a new Galaxy S21 FE 5G phone for free.

Samsung's Galaxy S21 FE release date is slated for Tuesday, January 11. The entry model Galaxy S21 FE features a 6.4-inch (2340 x 1080) 120Hz AMOLED display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 8-core CPU, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Powered by Android 12, the Galaxy S21 FE boasts dual SIM support, IP68 water resistance and a long-lasting 4,500mAh battery with 25W Super fast charging.

Beginning January 11, the Galaxy S21 FE will be available at T-Mobile for $699. However, when you trade-in an eligible device and sign up for a Magenta Max or Sprint Max plan, you'll get up to $700 off. So basically, you're getting a free Galaxy S21 FE.

Or, you can get up to $400 off the new Galaxy S21 FE when you trade in an eligible device and agree to any T-Mobile or Sprint wireless service plan.

Need an extra phone for a family member? T-Mobile's buy one, get one free offer has you covered. To get this deal, buy a Galaxy S21 FE for $699 from T-Mobile and you'll get an additional Galaxy S21 for free when you add a new line.

Your Galaxy S21 FE savings will appear as credits on your monthly billing statements over the course of 24 months.

In terms of new year phone deals, these are among the best we've seen thus far.","{'uri': 'laptopmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'LaptopMag'}","[{'uri': 'hilda_scott@laptopmag.com', 'name': 'Hilda Scott', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAz5DhwXeeKNzvpyo7kkGN-1200-80.jpg,0.3411764705882352,eng-7377109,False,0.8627451062202454,0.3411764705882352,379021440,1

Audio digital signal processing will be 2.5 times more rapid, too. All of these increases in speed suggest that this new infotainment system will be capable of much snappier performance. As before, the system will feature over-the-air, or OTA, updates as well as navigation via Google Maps and Google Assistant.

Android Automotive OS is distinct from Android Auto -- the former is a whole-vehicle operating system, while the latter is essentially limited to tech that mirrors one's smartphone on a vehicle's dashboard.

An as-yet-unnamed future Volvo-branded SUV will also be among the first vehicles to get third-generation Snapdragon power. As Roadshow reported last June, the new Polestar 3 will share its underlying Scalable Product Architecture 2, or SPA 2, platform with Volvo's forthcoming third-generation XC90, so it wouldn't be surprising if the Tier 1 supplier is speaking opaquely about Volvo's next range-topping SUV.

Recent Volvo and Polestar model releases have been powered by Android Automotive OS, including the XC40 Recharge and C40 Recharge. It's unclear if this next-generation Snapdragon 3 system will make use of a similar 9-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen like those vehicles, or if there will be enhancements to their menu systems or any changes to physical switchgear on the dashboard. Recent Volvo and Polestar models have received praise for their sleek and modern cabins as well as criticism for a perceived overreliance on touchscreen controls instead of physical buttons, an arrangement some users find less intuitive.

Both the Polestar 3 and the next-generation XC90 will be built at Volvo's new plant in South Carolina. The 3 will be Polestar's first vehicle that isn't built in China.","{'uri': 'cnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNET'}","[{'uri': 'chris_paukert@cnet.com', 'name': 'Chris Paukert', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/XqXh1oUFKuDfyCY7SPWUYNmS-eA=/2021/12/02/7f064701-58db-4ea4-b950-46ecce7b41e5/polestar-3-2021-12-02-ogi.jpg,0.07450980392156858,,False,0,0.07450980392156858,379021380,1

Microsoft already has its cross-device Microsoft Mesh VR/AR ecosystem, along with its Windows Mixed Reality platform, and is integrating Teams into VR and AR this year. But Qualcomm is working on a software platform for phones, called Snapdragon Spaces, that plans to bridge a coming wave of AR glasses and Android phones.

Smart glasses in general are still very much a work in progress, but one of the key things that's still needed for these types of devices is a common software platform. That sounds like exactly what this Qualcomm partnership aims to solve.

According to Qualcomm's press release, the collaboration will involve ""developing custom AR chips to enable a new wave of power efficient, lightweight AR glasses to deliver rich and immersive experiences, and plans to integrate software like Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform."" Whether that means Microsoft's future AR glasses will have additional powers beyond others in Qualcomm's planned lineup of products isn't entirely clear, but it does suggest that a common connecting thread between future AR products may already be forming. Of course, that's exactly what the whole ""metaverse strategy"" that seems to be in play everywhere right now has needed all along.

Microsoft had already been exploring using the HoloLens 2 in more outdoor situations as a stepping-stone to future smaller glasses-like devices. Last year, the company announced an explorational partnership with Niantic as a way to explore how gaming would eventually work on smart glasses.","{'uri': 'cnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNET'}","[{'uri': 'scott_stein@cnet.com', 'name': 'Scott Stein', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/Ae_iTMzvAJdZ5Q25S6PfIFzycU4=/1200x630/2021/03/10/142bd8ca-08ab-40d5-aebc-9b52ceb6acea/hololens-2-lens.jpg,0.192156862745098,eng-7379690,False,0.4745098054409027,0.192156862745098,379021380,3

The goggles still need to be tethered with a cable to a PC -- they're not a standalone headset -- but they show, potentially, how much more compact VR goggles could be getting in the next year or so. HTC's Vive Flow, released last year, aimed for a similar super-compact design. Notably, neither seem to fit over normal glasses.

Panasonic demonstrated an earlier version of this headset two years ago at CES, but this version is actually being released this spring, for around $900. The headset has its own Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1 processor to enable tracking, and a more compact display with pancake lenses -- a similar type of tech is expected in Meta's next-gen VR headset, Project Cambria. Qualcomm has long hinted at more compact VR and AR headsets coming in the next year or two, leaning on the company's chips and technology.

Shiftall also sells other accessories that work with SteamVR and the headset, aiming for a total-body immersive experience. One, a leg and hip-connected set of trackers called HaritoraX, is coming to the US in the spring for $270 (and also works with the Oculus Quest 2, apparently). Another, the Pebble Feel, is a $200 Bluetooth-connected vest with a temperature-changing module on the back that gets hot and cold, sending temperature fluctuations that could sync with VR experiences. A $200 mouth-worn voice-suppressing microphone, Mutalk, is designed to prevent ambient environment noise from ""leaking into the metaverse,"" or to muffle conversation in public places where you might be in VR, perhaps.","{'uri': 'cnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNET'}","[{'uri': 'scott_stein@cnet.com', 'name': 'Scott Stein', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/umwXA2AdI1s9ZOVWRjK1LraJQ9c=/1200x630/2022/01/04/7811952b-1b95-47c0-9134-ac22ee4c7c7f/meganex-ces2022-01.jpg,-0.02745098039215688,eng-7379087,False,0.5490196347236633,-0.02745098039215688,379021380,2

""The office opening is further evidence of the company's commitment to bring new and exciting technologies to the Automotive sector,"" said Enrico Salvatori, senior vice president and president of Europe/MEA and Qualcomm Europe, in a statement.

The digital chassis is a suite of cloud-connected ""platforms"" which automakers can adopt in full or à la carte, and it includes: the Snapdragon Ride Platform for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving, the Auto Connectivity Platform for LTE, 5G connected services, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning, and the next generation of the Snapdragon Cockpit, a digital cockpit and infotainment system.

Qualcomm's integrated automotive platforms, including the digital chassis, have an order pipeline of more than $13 billion, according to the company. Snapdragon as it stands today is built off the back of Qualcomm's car-to-cloud service, announced at CES in 2020, which was the company's first product that aimed to keep cars connected to the cloud. This would allow for faster over-the-air updates and the ability to gather vehicle and usage analytics to create new revenue streams both for the company and for automaker partners.

""Qualcomm Technologies understands automakers' needs for uniqueness and differentiation as well as the tremendous opportunity to redefine the automotive and transportation business model,"" said Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and general manager of automotive at Qualcomm, in a statement. ""The Snapdragon Digital Chassis allows platforms to stay continually up-to-date with new capabilities after vehicle purchase, while allowing the automaker to create new features and services for enhanced customer engagement and services-based business models.""

Volvo became one of the many automakers to integrate Snapdragon into their vehicles, the companies announced on Tuesday. Volvo's upcoming fully electric SUV and Volvo EV brand Polestar's Polestar 3 SUV will both be powered by Qualcomm's digital cockpit, powered by Google's Android OS, and a suite of wireless technologies to support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and the automaker expects to launch vehicles with these features later this year.

Honda also shared plans to bring Qualcomm's digital cockpit to its upcoming models for the first time, which it expects to be commercially available in the U.S. in the second half of 2022 and across the globe in 2023.

Renault Group announced in September its plans to integrate the digital cockpit into its Mégane E-Tech electric vehicle, but on Tuesday, the company shared plans to expand that collaboration to the entire suite of digital chassis platforms, including the connectivity platform and the Snapdragon Ride platform.

Volvo, Honda and Renault join the increasingly long list of Qualcomm Snapdragon customers, which seemed to have picked up in earnest around the time Qualcomm acquired automotive tech company Veoneer in October. Since then, Qualcomm has signed on around 40 OEMs, including BMW, GM, Hyundai, JiDu, Xpeng, NIO and WM, to integrate different Snapdragon platforms into their vehicles.

Qualcomm's Snapdragon is also enabling other companies building automotive infotainment centers to innovate. At CES, the company announced a partnership with Alps Alpine to develop a ""Digital Cabin,"" which is powered by the Snapdragon cockpit. The cabin includes technologies such as an e-mirror that helps ameliorate blind spots by providing a peripheral view, a large ceiling display and sound zones that project noise individually to each passenger.

While most of Qualcomm's clients are opting to enhance their cockpits and infotainment systems, the company might be most bullish on its Ride platform, a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that should provide a powerful enough processor to allow for many ADAS and automated driving functions. Veoneer's Arriver self-driving software unit has only enhanced Ride, which has allowed it to compete directly with Nvidia's Drive Orin SoC, which is already being used to develop similar functionalities with customers like Cruise, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Zoox and, most recently, TuSimple.","{'uri': 'techcrunch.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechCrunch'}",[],https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?w=711,0.4274509803921569,eng-7383748,False,0.843137264251709,0.4274509803921569,379020840,8

Brad Lynch, a tech and VR analyst, took to Twitter today to reveal some new information about some of Meta's upcoming VR devices. He mostly focused in information about the displays Meta is planning on using in the Quest Pro and Quest 3, but he also discussed other specs for the headsets as well as their production timelines.

The leak claimed that the Quest Pro, referenced as Project Cambria in Lynch's post, will use miniLED, a display mostly seen in newer TVs and some Apple products. This should look much better than the 1920 x 1832 LCD lenses in the Quest 2, though we don't know yet what resolution the Quest Pro will use.

In the latest Connect 2021 livestream, Zuckerberg suggested that the Quest Pro will use ""pancake optics"" to ""fold light several times over"" so they can have a thinner, lighter profile. That, combined with the miniLED, should make the Quest Pro a major step up in visual quality.

Lynch says the Quest Pro is slated for ""Q2 2022,"" which indicates it could launch somewhere between April and June of this year. According to the latest rumors, the Quest Pro is a wireless headset that plays all of the best Quest 2 games, while also adding cameras for face/eye tracking and updated Touch controllers.

As for the Quest 3, it's set to use uOLED, an upgraded version of an OLED display. OLED's been used in some high-fidelity headsets in the past, but the Quest 3 would likely be the first mass-market device to use the display technology.

Lynch also specified that Meta had already finalized the production details for the uOLED with Changxin Technology and that the device would be revealed in a Meta Connect in 2023 and released soon after. Given the last few Connects happened in September or October, that suggests the Quest 3 will arrive in late 2023.

Beyond the Quest 3's display, Meta is reportedly also working on a proprietary chipset for the device that won't utilize Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR3 processor, even though it's likely to be available by the time the Quest 3 enters production. Lynch says this custom SoC will ""focus on a GPU that is better designed for VR loads.""","{'uri': 'androidcentral.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Central'}",[],https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/10/oculus-quest-2-with-controllers-hero.jpg,0.1372549019607843,eng-7378432,False,0.545098066329956,0.1372549019607843,379019520,1

But once the transition began, it was pursued with dedication and ambition, drawing on the same developmental mindset that drove the country's approach to fossil-fuelled industrialisation in the latter half of the 20th century.

South Korea was the second major East Asian nation to utilise catch-up strategies of technology leverage, after Japan. It built its first manufacturing industries in clothing and textiles, then moved on to simple electronics and white goods before tackling heavy and chemical industries in the 1970s, focused on the automotive sector. In the early 1990s, the roads were full of locally-made cars -- Hyundais, Kias -- a visible sign of a strong state at work in building and protecting a new industry.

The 'Korean way' was always about accelerated catch-up, driven by high levels of indebtedness. South Korea took bigger risks and went for bigger rewards. It was as scholar Jung En-woo called it, a 'race to the swift'.

The transformation was evident in the career of Lee Byung-chull, founder of Samsung, who had been branded as a war profiteer during the Korean war but at his death was hailed as a national hero. He had taken Samsung from a simple sugar and food producer to an international giant in the most advanced aspects of semiconductor production at the core of the electronics and IT industries. He was also guiding Samsung to become an automotive company that would rival and perhaps outclass Hyundai, only to see these plans cut short by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

Perhaps the most famous of South Korea's big bets was to back the telco standard CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), introduced as a 3G technology standard for mobile phones by the US firm Qualcomm. South Korea actively backed this as one of the first movers, inducing Samsung and others into the nascent market. This choice propelled the South Korean firms to become telco giants. South Korea used all available state resources to ensure that CDMA was adopted as a standard internationally, helping to launch the mobile tech revolution.

In the 21st century, the focus of South Korea's developmental ambitions has shifted from promoting the fossil-fuel intensive industries of the past to the new, clean green industries of the future. Since the mid 2000s, successive South Korean governments -- anxious about the economic, environmental and political costs of the country's reliance on fossil fuels -- have prioritised this shift.

South Korea's continued developmental ambitions are clear in the Moon Jae-in administration's set of strategies announced as part of the Digital New Deal, combined with a suite of policies labelled the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal exemplifies the trends of the East Asian clean energy transition. It contains anticipated strategies like the provision of improved green infrastructure and a swing towards renewables as the country seeks less dependency on fossil fuels.

But it is in building a new automotive sector based on electric vehicles, encompassing battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, that South Korea's ambition is most evident. The South Koreans are betting big on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, where Hyundai already rivals Toyota as a world-leading producer and pioneer. The stakes are enormous, with Hyundai promising to become one of the world leaders in taking vehicles to the next level of green electrification.

The government aims to establish South Korea's leadership -- especially over China -- in the technology-intensive, job-creating industries of the future. Economic dynamism, job creation and pollution control are essential to maintaining the government's political legitimacy.

The Green New Deal's energy component includes raising the level of renewable energies, building out the smart grid, promoting renewables and expanding the supply of electric and fuel cell electric vehicles (1.3 million electric and 200,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2025). These are ambitious targets that will represent heavy state intervention in the market.

Placing big bets and then using state resources to bring about the desired market shift is key to the Korean way. South Korea's strategic approach to green growth is to focus on creative destruction -- building the new while dismantling the old -- as an industry strategy, not just as a pure play to reduce carbon emissions.

The result is the same -- reducing carbon emissions. South Korea is building green industries with lower carbon emissions, but the emphasis in policy is all about the industrial transformation that drives it. This is an extension of the well-established developmental mindset, or developmental environmentalism, now applied to climate goals. The Korean way to the green transition, viewed as the next great transformation of industrial capitalism, promises to give developing countries worldwide a chance to catch-up through developmental-environmental strategies. East Asia is moving to become the fulcrum of the next great industrial transformation.

CES, the world's largest technology show, is pressing on, but with fewer major exhibitors appearing in-person than expected due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. On December 22nd, exhibitor Lenovo announced that it would ""suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas,"" following announcements from T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta, and others that they'd be ditching as well and despite CES organizers' statements that the show would go on.

Intel says it will move to a ""digital-first"" experience with minimal on-site staff

T-Mobile was the most prominent exhibitor to bail early that week. CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show's featured speakers, publicly announced on Tuesday that he would no longer be doing a keynote and would ""significantly limit our in-person participation.""

Amazon decided not to attend the show in-person entirely, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, and AT&T also dropped out on Wednesday, according to Axios' Ina Fried.

Hisense typically has a large press conference and significant presence in the LVCC's central hall, but on Thursday morning, Hisense announced it decided to make its January 4th press conference fully virtual ""to ensure the health and safety of our team."" The company still plans to have a booth at the show, with in-person walkthroughs for those attending and virtual ones for those covering it from home.

It was followed closely later in the day by Waymo, as Alphabet's self-driving car company updated its blog post to explain the decision. ""Based on quickly rising COVID-19 infection rates, Waymo has made the difficult decision not to participate in person at CES 2022. We are aiming to still virtually participate in some CES-related events. In particular, as part of our Self-Driven Women series, our co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana and our Global Head of Public Policy Michelle Peacock will speak at several virtual panel discussions with the Female Quotient, the official equality partner of CES 2022.""

Google: ""we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022.""

Chipmaking giant Intel said on Thursday afternoon that ""[after] consulting with health officials and in the spirit of Intel's safety policy, our plans for CES will move to a digital-first, live experience, with minimal on-site staff."" Gaming accessory maker HyperX also said it's pivoting away from in-person plans and will support conversations and activities virtually.

The dominoes continued to fall on Thursday, as General Motors announced its presence will be all-digital. Less than a day ago, GM confirmed to The Verge that it still planned to attend CES, where CEO Mary Barra was scheduled as a keynote speaker, and it planned to debut an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado, but now that has changed.

A statement from the company says, ""We have decided to move to an all-digital approach with our activation at CES 2022 in January. CES is an important technology platform, and we are continuing with our plans on January 5 to share our significant company news including the reveal of the Chevrolet Silverado EV.""

GM was closely followed out the door by Google, which has frequently used CES to host larger and more extravagant showcases for its new hardware. It had planned to have a booth at the event, but Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman tweeted on Thursday that, like its corporate sibling Waymo, it is backing out of the in-person event.

In a statement given to The Verge, Google communications manager Ivy Hunt says, ""After careful consideration we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022. We've been closely monitoring the development of the Omicron variant, and have decided that this is the best choice for the health and safety of our teams. We will continue to collaborate closely with both CTA and our partners to identify and support virtual opportunities, and we look forward to sharing the latest Google innovations with you all.""

With just a few days left before the show begins, the list of dropouts continues to grow. AMD had previously said it was still planning to appear, but on December 28th (via Tom's Hardware) it issued the following statement: ""AMD has decided to cancel our in-person presence at CES 2022 in Las Vegas and will instead transition to a virtual experience. While the AMD 2022 Product Premiere was always planned as a digital-only livestream, our in-person engagements will now transition to virtual in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, partners and communities. We look forward to sharing all our exciting news as scheduled on January 4th.""

Another late scratch is MSI. The computer maker says in a post on its website that ""Since December, the rapidly spreading Omicron variant has brought the USA a surge of COVID-19 cases. The health and well-being of our employees, customers and fans are our top priority. Hence, we have decided not to participate in-person at CES 2022 and will join the show virtually with our online product launch.""

OnePlus was not an official exhibitor at the show, but it says it has canceled an event that was planned to coincide with it in Las Vegas. TechCrunch notes that Proctor & Gamble, the parent company of Gillette and Oral-B, which have used CES to debut new technology, is also skipping the in-person event.

As of Thursday, December 30th, BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes are either entirely out or have reduced their in-person presence.

Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio also all announced that they won't attend this version of the annual Las Vegas expo in light of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the US, as have major tech publications including The Verge, CNET, Engadget, Gizmodo, TechCrunch, TechRadar, and Tom's Guide.

""T-Mobile will continue to serve as a CES sponsor and title sponsor of the DRL Championship Race but the vast majority of our team will not be traveling to Las Vegas,"" reads the company's press release. ""Additionally, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will no longer be offering a keynote in-person or virtually.""

Lenovo typically has a medium-sized presence at CES, typically making an array of announcements, though most of its activity generally happens on the Las Vegas Strip and in private meeting rooms rather than a public booth on the show floor.

AT&T, by comparison, had a seemingly tiny presence at this year's show. While the company's ""AT&T Business"" division is listed as a featured exhibitor, the company was not expected to have a keynote. AT&T Business also only appears to have one very small booth in the Health and Wellness section of the Las Vegas Convention Center's North Hall, with no booths for AT&T in general.

Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung, which has a featured keynote like T-Mobile, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like LG, Panasonic, and Sony.

Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point

We've asked some key companies if they're still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend, and LG said that ""Unless CTA says otherwise,"" it's ""still on board."" CES maps show that LG has a very large booth at CES, but the company's said it's taking a hybrid approach, making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.

Bloomberg reported last week that AMD (now out) and Samsung were still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus, and HTC still plan to attend. Sony and Samsung have said they are ""monitoring local conditions,"" which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed (as it has already been for companies like Google and GM).

On December 21st, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. ""At this point, we're very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,"" a CTA exec told Adweek.

The day after that, the CTA said it's received 42 exhibitor cancellations but has also added 60 new exhibitors in that time.

Here is the CTA's full statement to The Verge from Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications:

CES will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don't wish to, or can't travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.

While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Thursday, we've added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.

CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore, thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as announced yesterday many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.

Given CES' comprehensive health measures -- vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests -- coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access.

In the recent past, we've seen the question of ""will they or won't they cancel due to COVID"" take a while to resolve. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020. Major tech companies ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021 as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, was all virtual.

As far as why ""CES will and must go on,"" CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro published a Christmas Day op-ed in the Las Vegas Review-Journal that says, among other things, "" CES 2022 will kick off 2022 in messy fashion, but it will be chock full of innovation and full of entrepreneurs and businesses. We will all be taking risks. But without risk there is no innovation.""

The company launched several promising smartphones in 2021, including the Honor 60 series, the Honor 50 series, and the Honor Magic 3 lineup -- and seems to have much bigger plans for 2022. These plans also include their first-ever foldable smartphone - the Honor Magic V - which has finally received its official launch date.

In late December 2021, the company teased the Honor Magic V for the first time with a slick-looking video (embedded below) on its social media accounts. Today, Honor Global tweeted out a message that confirms that their first-ever foldable smartphone will be formally unveiled on January 10. The event, unsurprisingly, will be held in China and will be livestreamed across the globe starting at 6:30 am ET.

What are we expecting?

So far, Honor has done a pretty good job of keeping the juicy bits surrounding the Magic V under wraps. Apart from a rough idea about the phone's appearance, we do not really know much about Honor's first foldable phone.

From the video (above), it is evident that the phone shares its design with Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 2. The accompanying image with today's announcement does confirm that the phone has a triple rear camera array and a centrally placed hole punch cutout for the selfie camera on the external display.

&mdash; HONOR (@Honorglobal) January 4, 2022

Initially, there were rumors that the Honor Magic V could derive heavily from Huawei's own Mate X2 showcased last year. In fact, there were also reports about the likelihood of it being a rebranded Huawei X2 with some improvements and Google Services support thrown in. Looking at the fresh images, however, we can almost certainly rule out that possibility.

Rumor has it that the Honor Magic V could feature an 8-inch foldable display and an external display that measures 6-inches across. The foldable display will be reportedly sourced via Chinese display-major BOE. Chances are high the Honor Magic V will use Qualcomm's latest flagship chip -- the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.

The company has confirmed that the Honor Magic V will be unveiled on January 10 at 11:30 AM UTC.

The Honor Magic V is the company's first foldable phone and follows the Oppo Find N as the latest foldable phone to come to the market. But there are a few things that will help Honor's first foldable phone stand out from the crowd.

For one, the Magic V will be the first foldable to be released powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 CPU. Unlike the Find N, the Magic V will also fold horizontally, similar to how the Galaxy Z Fold 3 folds in half. There are a few other cues that we can take away from the teaser image above. For one, there will be a hole-punch selfie camera on the outer screen, along with a triple camera setup oriented vertically on the back. Honor will also be included a dual-LED flash, along with PDAF sensors placed in the module to the right of the main camera bar.

According to a series of recent leaks, the Magic V will sport a 120Hz refresh for one of the displays, while the other display will see a 90Hz refresh rate. We aren't sure exactly which is which, but it's safe to assume that the primary screen will have the faster refresh rates. Thankfully, it seems that Honor isn't going to mess around on the software side either, as the Magic V will be the first foldable to ship with Android 12 out of the box. While we don't exactly know what the battery life will be, rumors point to 66W fast wired charging, which will feel like a dream compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 3.

The foldable smartphone market is heating up, as we're seeing more and more phone makers take on Samsung by releasing competing devices. Hopefully, Honor's Magic V isn't limited to a China-only release, as we would love to get our hands on the phone to see how it stacks up.","{'uri': 'phandroid.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Phandroid - Android News and Reviews'}",[],https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/HONOR-Magic-V-640x360.jpg,0.1843137254901961,eng-7381945,False,0.8274509906768799,0.1843137254901961,379017660,1

The collection includes the Alienware X14, which is being dubbed the world's thinnest 14-inch gaming laptop, as well as the Alienware M17 Ryzen Edition, an all AMD-powered gaming laptop. We have all the details for you right here.

The highlight of the lineup is the Alienware x14, which is one of Alienware's thinnest gaming laptops yet. This gaming laptop is so thin thanks to a dual-torque hinge that creates space within the system, as well as its magnesium alloy material. The system measures 0.57 inches in height but still keeps all the raw graphics power expected out of an Alienware product.

CPU options range from the 12th-gen Intel Core i7-12700H, or the Intel Core i9-12900H (14-cores, 20 threads on both.) Graphics range from the RTX 3050, 3050Ti, or the 3060, with 4GB, 4GB, or 6GB VRAM. Pricing starts at $1,800, with availability set for the winter. All configurations ship with Dolby Vision, and the Dolby Atmos certification. There's also a 120W Type-C Small Form Factor Adapter included in the box.

As for the rest of the X-series lineup, Alienware also announced the x15 R2, x17 R2. These are the bigger siblings to the x14 and are the thinnest 15-inch and 17-inch gaming laptops Alienware ever created. CPU and GPU configuration options are the same as the x14, as is the design material. These are priced at $2,200, and $2,300, respectively with the same winter release date.

Also coming in 2022 from Alienware are some new M-series laptops. At the top of the lineup is the Alienware M17 R5. This is being dubbed as the world's most powerful 17 inch AMD Advantage laptop. It combines an architecture that includes AMD Ryzen processors, AMD Radeon graphics, and AMD SmartShift MAX, SmartAccess Memory, and SmartAccess Graphics.

Alienware is also opting for Qualcomm Wi-Fi 6E Dual 2x2 Wireless LAN on this laptop. As for CPU options, the list includes Ryzen 7-6800H, Ryzen 9 6900HX, Ryzen 9 6980HZ. GPU options include Nvidia's 30-series graphics, or the AMD Radeon RX 6700M, or the AMD Radeon RX 6850M XT. A smaller option, the Alienware M15 R7 is also avaialble, inculding an Intel variant. Pricing starts at $1,600 for the m15 R5 AMD, $1,500 for the M15 R7 AMD. Availability is set for spring 2022. Intel's version of the m15 is set for launch in the winter, and pricing should be around $2,100.

Of course, Alienware does have some accessories that it's planning to launch, too. These include the Tri-Mode Wireless Gaming Headset and Mouse. The headset is designed with 3D sound in mind and supports Dolby Atmos, touch controls on the touch earcup. As for the mouse, it features up to 16,000 DPI io tracking, up to 650 IPS, and sensors that can handle up to 50G max acceleration. These are priced at $200, and $150, respectively.

Capping things out is the Alienware 34 QD-OLED Gaming Display. This is the world's first quantum-dot OLED monitor. With this, you get a slim panel design and superior color performance with higher peak luminance. The monitor features 99.3% of the DCI-P3 gamut, 1,000 nits brightness, Nvidia G-Sync. Pricing has not yet been announced, nor a release date in the USA.","{'uri': 'onmsft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'OnMSFT.com'}","[{'uri': 'arif_bacchus@onmsft.com', 'name': 'Arif Bacchus', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.onmsft.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Alienware-14.jpg,0.1607843137254903,eng-7383187,False,0.8117647171020508,0.1607843137254903,379016160,1

Much of the show will, however, take place away from the bright lights of The Strip and instead be live-streamed on laptops and desktops around the world.

The Omicron variant has upended some of the biggest exhibitors' plans, forcing the likes of Intel, Google, and GM to host virtual press conferences rather than in-person events. The Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, even canceled the last day of the show.

And while many participants will still participate in person, the show is unlikely to be the kind of massive tech extravaganza that you'd find prior to the pandemic.

Still, there will be an impressive array of new and interesting products on display during the COVID-shortened show, which various companies are streaming for the public. From self-driving cars and massive new TVs to smart home gadgets, the metaverse, and NFTs, CES 2022 will feature all of the latest tech has to offer. Here's what to expect from one of the biggest tech shows of the year.

One of the biggest focuses of the show will be the ongoing electric car race. CES is as much a car show as it is a technology show, and the same can be said of this year's pared down version of the event. In prior years automakers ranging from Hyundai to Mercedes Benz and Fisker have shown off their high-tech autos and automotive concepts, and 2022 will be no different.

Expect to see GM (GM) roll out its highly anticipated electric Silverado pickup, which the company says will get a whopping 400 miles of range. But the Silverado is coming to market with some serious competition in the form of Ford's (F) F-150 Lightning, which that automaker says has nearly 200,000 preorders and goes on sale this year.

There's also the Rivian (RIVN) RT1, which should begin ending up in consumers' driveways in March. And then there's Tesla's (TSLA) Cybertruck, which will begin production later this year.

Mercedes, meanwhile, debuted its new Vision EQXX concept on Monday, with a claimed 620 miles of range per charge.

It's not just about the vehicles themselves, though. CES 2022 will also give us a look at the technology behind future cars including self-driving features that will, eventually, ensure you can get from place to place without having to even glance at the road.

Cars may be the new stars of CES, but TVs are still one of the most watched categories of products at the show. Where else can you get a look, virtually at least, at some of the most impressive sets around.

This will be the 11th CES I've covered throughout my career, and each one has showcased the latest and greatest TVs have to offer.

This year, you'll see plenty of news about 8K sets, the next step up in resolution from 4K for TVs. Here's the thing though: Unless you're mounting a TV the size of a billboard in your home, or sitting so close your eyes are touching the screen, 8K isn't for you. Oh, and there's the little issue of 8K content, which is sorely lacking. Heck, we've only just started getting a sizable amount of 4K content.

Putting that aside, though, 2022 will give us a number of innovations from high-end, mid-range, and entry-level TV makers. Samsung has already leaked its CES news, announcing an updated version of its Frame TV with an anti-reflective matte display. The company also debuted a new battery-free remote that Samsung says can be charged via sunlight or by absorbing energy from a router's radio waves.

Expect to hear plenty of chatter about display technologies including OLED and micro LED, both of which promise better image quality than traditional LED panels. And don't rule out some slick new form factors. Don't forget, LG previously debuted its rollable TV at CES, while Samsung showed off its rotating TV during prior shows.

It's hard to imagine that Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and Qualcomm (QCOM) will take the virtual stage at CES 2022 and not debut at least some new chips. Intel is expected to show off its latest mobile laptop chips as well as its dedicated graphics cards.

AMD is reportedly set to debut its own new graphics cards, while Nvidia could give us a look at its own beefy cards. Qualcomm could also give us a better idea of its augmented reality/virtual reality and automotive strategies too.

Gamers, for their part, should also get some good news in the form of a slew of gaming PCs and hardware that's sure to leave players drooling.

The metaverse and NFTs (non fungible tokens) became some of the most popular terms in tech, and finance, in 2021, and you can bet that will continue in 2022. Need proof? Look no further than Samsung, which announced that it is launching the world's first TV screen-based NFT explorer that will let users search for and display their NFTs on their big screens.

You can bet that the metaverse, or at least the various visions companies have for the collection of persistent online worlds, will also be on full display during this year's event. That could come in the form of new VR/ AR headsets or actual metaverse platforms. We'll just have to wait and see.

Yes, we saw the strange leak of Exynos 2200 falling a bit short as compared to its predecessor's evolutionary gains, and now Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 seems to be headed the same way if tipster Golden Reviewer is to be believed. That said, it is juxtaposed with the benchmarking duel between Dimensity 9000 and Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 suggesting the former is in fact better than the latter!

All the three chipsets are based on the 4nm node process and Qualcomm being the industry leader is under more pressure to deliver this year since MediaTek is coming in strong. Thermals seem to be the major issue on all these chipsets and the latest test of Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC on the Motorola Edge X30 doesn't spell much good news for Qualcomm.

As per Golden Reviewer, the flagship chipset has very obvious efficiency, sustained performance, and heating issues. One can say, Motorola might not have implemented the SoC optimally or there might be underlying problems with the tested chipset, but at the end of the day, that's just a lame excuse.

The in-depth tests tweeted by the tipster show that the Cortex A510 cores used in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 are 15 percent more powerful than the A55 cores on the Snapdragon 888. But on the flip side, it is 33 percent less efficient; a very bad trade-off, if we might put it mildly.

Cortex X2 super core also doesn't excite much as the power consumption is going to be 70 percent more and the A710 mid-core is not much better when compared to the A78 GPU. On top of it, all the thermal management for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 has taken a hit as compared to Snapdragon 888.

On the brighter side of things, these are just tests run a device that we don't know much about, and in real-world settings, Qualcomm might tweak things just right to get things back on track. If, however, the pattern of these unverified benchmark tests follows to the finally released SoC running on an optimized mobile device, it will be utterly disappointing!","{'uri': 'androidcommunity.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Community'}",[],https://androidcommunity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-SoC.jpg?w=640,0.1372549019607843,eng-7383684,False,0.7921568751335144,0.1372549019607843,379015200,2

Both carriers were to begin rolling out the new C-band spectrum as soon as January 5. However, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Chief Steve Dickson sent a formal request to the CEOs of both companies asking that they delay the rollout for a couple of weeks. This would provide more time to address concerns around possible interference with aircraft instruments, officials said.

On Sunday, AT&T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg rejected the call for a delay, stating that doing so would be ""an irresponsible abdication of the operating control required to deploy world-class and globally competitive communications networks.""

Instead, the pair of CEOs agreed to create a temporary ""exclusion zone"" around airports for a period of six months. They pointed to similar practices in other countries like France, where U.S. airlines regularly operate without incident.

Aviation industry fears persist

However, this wasn't enough to quell the fears of aviation industry leaders. Trade groups such as Airlines for America called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to act, adding that if it failed to do so, it would take the matter directly to the courts.

Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA), announced on Twitter that her 50,000 workers ""won't fly if there's a question"" about safety, adding that ""we won't allow the traveling public to be guinea pigs."" In an interview with MSNBC on January 3, Nelson put it more succinctly, stating that ""we are simply not going to take off if those flights are potentially at risk.""

According to Reuters, AT&T and Verizon reversed course late last night, following a day of intensive talks"" between the wireless firms and representatives from the aviation sector. Both companies have announced that they will now agree to the two-week delay after all, with AT&T noting that it was doing so at the request of Buttigieg.

Another delay

The new agreement pushes back the deployment date to January 19, and it's clear that neither carrier has changed its mind about the safety of the new midband spectrum. .

After spending $80 billion to acquire the new spectrum in an FCC auction early last year, the carriers had planned to begin deployment on December 5. However, in early November, they voluntarily agreed to delay these rollouts into the new year to give the FAA more time to study the effects of the new spectrum. In late 2020, the RTCA, an independent standards development organization, published a research paper that showed evidence that a concentration of 5G telecommunications in the 3.7 to 3.98GHz spectrum could cause ""harmful interference"" to radar altimeters.

However, the carriers remain confident that the midband 5G spectrum poses no risk, and that the compromises they've proposed should provide even more certainty that the new frequencies won't cause any interference with aviation. In December, both carriers said they would lower 5G power levels for the first six months of deployment, and more recently, they've promised to avoid setting up new C-band transceivers around airports entirely during the initial rollout.

Today sees the arrival of a new virtual reality (VR) headset from Japanese tech company Shiftall Inc. The MeganeX is an ultra-lightweight 5.2K device that's SteamVR compatible and slated to arrive this Spring.

A subsidiary of Panasonic, up to now Shiftall is best known for the HaritoraX, a motion-tracking device compatible with SteamVR. The MeganeX takes those VR ambitions up a notch, promising a device that's not only light but also packs 1.3inch OLED Microdisplays with a 2,560×2,560 per eye resolution at a 120Hz refresh rate. The displays come by way of the Kopin Corporation, which Panasonic previously partnered with for the VR Glasses shown at CES 2020 followed by an update the following year. In fact, MeganeX looks very similar albeit with those extra handles on the side.

Another feature that Kopin might be helping Shiftall with is the lenses. MeganeX features pancake lenses, optics designed to slim down headsets. Kopin revealed last year its latest all-plastic Pancake optics to further reduce weight. Shiftall says its device should weigh in at approximately 250g (8.8oz), slightly heavier than the Vive Flow which also utilises a pancake system.

With its glasses style design the MeganeX features a foldable frame with built-in speakers and because it supports SteamVR, the device has 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) head tracking. This is all powered by Qualcomm's older Snapdragon XR1 platform - Meta Quest uses the XR2 platform for reference. It'll also come with its own controller says Shiftall, although no further details were given regarding its capabilities.

YouTuber and tech analyst Brad Lynch is at CES 2022 and got an early look at the prototype, offering some positive feedback on the new headset in the video below.

But there shouldn't be too long to wait to see the final product in action as Shiftall has said the MeganeX will be released in Spring 2022 for under $900 USD - no details just yet on whether that's worldwide or region-specific.

The computer, known as a domain controller in the automotive industry, will be specifically engineered for TuSimple's commercial self-driving trucks, and will power sensor perception and vehicle operation.

Nvidia will provide artificial intelligence expertise and its Drive Orin hardware, a chip specifically designed for autonomous driving capabilities.

The controller powered by Nvidia's chip will be installed in the autonomous trucks TuSimple is currently developing in partnership with manufacturer Navistar, targeted for production in 2024.

""We believe this move provides us a significant competitive advantage in speeding time to market,"" TuSimple Chief Executive Officer Cheng Lu said in a statement.

TuSimple said it will own usage rights to the controller's design, adding that it planned to work with an unnamed third party manufacturer to produce it.

Considered crucial in the development of self-driving, controllers allow automakers to centralize compute-intensive instruments such as cameras, radars and lidar sensors.

Instead of each sensor being equipped with an individual electronic control unit, the domain controller handles computing tasks centrally, saving cost and space and allowing software updates to take place remotely.

Other chipmakers, including Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp's Mobileye and NXP are also offering domain controller chips for the automotive industry.

Self-driving freight trucks, while still operating largely in pilot projects, have become a focus of the autonomous industry in recent years, facing fewer regulatory and technological hurdles and potentially offering a faster way to generate returns than passenger robotaxis.

Much of the show will, however, take place away from the bright lights of The Strip and instead be live-streamed on laptops and desktops around the world.

The Omicron variant has upended some of the biggest exhibitors' plans, forcing the likes of Intel, Google, and GM to host virtual press conferences rather than in-person events. The Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, even canceled the last day of the show.

And while many participants will still participate in person, the show is unlikely to be the kind of massive tech extravaganza that you'd find prior to the pandemic.

Still, there will be an impressive array of new and interesting products on display during the COVID-shortened show, which various companies are streaming for the public. From self-driving cars and massive new TVs to smart home gadgets, the metaverse, and NFTs, CES 2022 will feature all of the latest tech has to offer. Here's what to expect from one of the biggest tech shows of the year.

One of the biggest focuses of the show will be the ongoing electric car race. CES is as much a car show as it is a technology show, and the same can be said of this year's pared down version of the event. In prior years automakers ranging from Hyundai to Mercedes Benz and Fisker have shown off their high-tech autos and automotive concepts, and 2022 will be no different.

Expect to see GM (GM) roll out its highly anticipated electric Silverado pickup, which the company says will get a whopping 400 miles of range. But the Silverado is coming to market with some serious competition in the form of Ford's (F) F-150 Lightning, which that automaker says has nearly 200,000 preorders and goes on sale this year.

There's also the Rivian (RIVN) RT1, which should begin ending up in consumers' driveways in March. And then there's Tesla's (TSLA) Cybertruck, which will begin production later this year.

Mercedes, meanwhile, debuted its new Vision EQXX concept on Monday, with a claimed 620 miles of range per charge.

It's not just about the vehicles themselves, though. CES 2022 will also give us a look at the technology behind future cars including self-driving features that will, eventually, ensure you can get from place to place without having to even glance at the road.

Cars may be the new stars of CES, but TVs are still one of the most watched categories of products at the show. Where else can you get a look, virtually at least, at some of the most impressive sets around.

This will be the 11th CES I've covered throughout my career, and each one has showcased the latest and greatest TVs have to offer.

This year, you'll see plenty of news about 8K sets, the next step up in resolution from 4K for TVs. Here's the thing though: Unless you're mounting a TV the size of a billboard in your home, or sitting so close your eyes are touching the screen, 8K isn't for you. Oh, and there's the little issue of 8K content, which is sorely lacking. Heck, we've only just started getting a sizable amount of 4K content.

Putting that aside, though, 2022 will give us a number of innovations from high-end, mid-range, and entry-level TV makers. Samsung has already leaked its CES news, announcing an updated version of its Frame TV with an anti-reflective matte display. The company also debuted a new battery-free remote that Samsung says can be charged via sunlight or by absorbing energy from a router's radio waves.

Expect to hear plenty of chatter about display technologies including OLED and micro LED, both of which promise better image quality than traditional LED panels. And don't rule out some slick new form factors. Don't forget, LG previously debuted its rollable TV at CES, while Samsung showed off its rotating TV during prior shows.

It's hard to imagine that Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and Qualcomm (QCOM) will take the virtual stage at CES 2022 and not debut at least some new chips. Intel is expected to show off its latest mobile laptop chips as well as its dedicated graphics cards.

AMD is reportedly set to debut its own new graphics cards, while Nvidia could give us a look at its own beefy cards. Qualcomm could also give us a better idea of its augmented reality/virtual reality and automotive strategies too.

Gamers, for their part, should also get some good news in the form of a slew of gaming PCs and hardware that's sure to leave players drooling.

The metaverse and NFTs (non fungible tokens) became some of the most popular terms in tech, and finance, in 2021, and you can bet that will continue in 2022. Need proof? Look no further than Samsung, which announced that it is launching the world's first TV screen-based NFT explorer that will let users search for and display their NFTs on their big screens.

You can bet that the metaverse, or at least the various visions companies have for the collection of persistent online worlds, will also be on full display during this year's event. That could come in the form of new VR/ AR headsets or actual metaverse platforms. We'll just have to wait and see.

A year after announcing mesh routers, Linksys is back at CES launching a Wi-Fi 6 home and office router. The Hydra Pro 6 is claimed to support 30 or more devices per node, with up to 5.6Gbps over 2,700 square feet.

""Our mission at Linksys is to connect everyone securely, whether it's someone working from home who needs reliable WiFi or a student intently taking notes during their online class,"" said Linksys CEO Harry Hewhirst in a statement. ""The Hydra Pro 6 is our latest router in a suite of products that offer next-level streaming, are easy to set up and equipped with advanced security and parental controls.""

""We are committed to delivering fast, reliable, and secure connectivity to the hybrid work era and beyond,"" he continued, ""and the Hydra Pro 6 is just the start.""

Hydra Pro 6 uses Qualcomm's Immersive Home Platform. Linksys includes Intelligent Mesh technology to enable more nodes to be added to create home mesh Wi-Fi coverage.

The router provides one Gigabit WAN Ethernet port, and 4 Gigabit LAN ports. There's also a single USB 3.0 port for file sharing and the like. It works on 2.4GHz and 5GHz, simultaneous dual-band, with six-stream Wi-Fi up to 574 + 4804 Mbps.

Hydra Pro 6 is powered by a 1GHz dual-core processor, and features two adjustable antennas. With those folded down, the unit is 8.465 inches by 6.1 inches by 2.205 inches.

The Linksys Hydra Pro 6 is shipping now and costs $299 on the Linksys official site. It will be available shortly on ""major retailers across the globe.""

And the year before. Asus has cultivated a name for itself, making phones that wholeheartedly embrace the ROG (Republic of Gamers) division's gaming DNA. And that means cramming in more hardware than users can ever fully utilize in a phone, creating an eye-catching design, and of course, generous use of RGB lighting.

However, the ROG Phones of the past have been more than just gimmicky slabs that come loaded with more RAM than a run-of-the-mill gaming laptop, top-of-the-line chip and fast storage. There are few tricks that justify the 'gaming tag' for the ROG Phone series devices, more so than any other rival out there with the same target audience. The standout feature of ROG Phone machines is the pair of capacitive shoulder buttons on the left and right corners doubling as triggers, giving an almost unfair advantage in games like Call Of Duty: Mobile with cramped on-screen controls. The secondary USB-C port on the side can be a godsend as well, and the loyalty to a 3.5mm headphone jack is commendable too.

It appears that the ROG Phone line will get another warrior to carry forward the mantle in 2022, and its design may have already got the leaked treatment. The folks over at EqualLeaks claim to have got their hands on the 2D renders of the Asus ROG Phone 6 and its more powerful Pro model. The design appears to have been heavily inspired by the Asus ROG Phone 5s Pro and the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate. The geometric patterns are here to stay, and the polygonal camera island design has also been retained. It appears that Asus will again arm its next gaming phone with a triple rear camera, which is not much of an upgrade unless the company is planning to fit in in a decent telephoto camera on its next gaming-centric phone.

Still Looks Game-Ready

The Asus ROG Phone 6 appears to retain the Active Matrix display strip on the rear panel for showing notification alerts, time and battery level, among other details. The same tech has also found its way to the ROG Zephyrus G line of gaming laptops and was also seen on the previous-gen ROG Phone. The ROG Phone 6 Pro, on the other hand, is shown sporting a true glass-made secondary display, just like the ROG Phone 5s Pro from last year. So far, the innards of the upcoming gaming-focused phone from Asus have remained a mystery, though.

If one were to take a safe guess, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC is almost locked, ticking alongside plenty of fast LPDDR5 RAM, a high refresh rate screen, at least UFS 3.1 standard storage, wide 5G band support, and a heavily-customized UI with some neat gaming tricks. However, the ROG Phone 6 series's design is somewhat of a disappointment for a phone that has so much to offer but still rocks more or less the same aesthetic DNA as the very first ROG Phone. It remains to be seen if Asus can serve something that truly stands out about the upcoming ROG Phone family members than just brute firepower and a design that is a relic of the past at this point.

There are some downgrades in the camera department with the same 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 main sensor backed by an eight-megapixel ultra-wide lens and, yet another, pointless two-megapixel macro sensor. That's not all as the selfie camera resolution is halved to 16-megapixels on the Realme GT 2. All Realme GT 2 series handsets are set to launch with RealmeUI 3.0 atop Android 12 pre-installed.

Sadly, the Realme GT 2 duo has only officially launched in China, but Realme has confirmed that the GT 2 series will ""debut in Europe soon"". Pricing starts at 3,899 yuan for 8GB/128GB up to 4,799 yuan for the 12GB/512GB Realme GT 2 Pro. Conversely, the standard model will start at just 2,699 yuan for the 8GB/128GB version.

TCL is hitting CES hard this year, with an ambitious slate of products we hope to see make their way to the US. We're going to break it down by category to make everything easy to keep track of.

TCL teased its latest smartphone lineup, the 30-series, in advance of Mobile World Congress. Right now there are eight phones on the company's roadmap, including the TCL 30, TCL 30+, TCL 30e, TCL 30 XE 5G, TCL 30 5G, TCL 30 V 5G, TCL SE, and TCL 306.

We don't expect all of these models to come to the US, but Stefan Streit, TCL's general manager of global marketing, told PCMag that several of these handsets will likely make their way here. Eric Anderson, general manager and vice president of TCL Communications North America, also confirmed that the company has partnership agreements with every major US carrier, so you can expect to see a lot more TCL phones on store shelves in the coming months. That said, only the TCL 30 XE 5G and TCL 30 V 5G are confirmed for the US at this time.

The TCL 30 XE 5G is a T-Mobile exclusive that offers affordable 5G (though we don't know the price just yet). It has a 6.52-inch LCD with a 90Hz refresh rate, along with a triple-camera stack with a 12MP primary lens. The phone is powered by a Mediatek Dimensity 700 chipset along with 4GB of RAM and has 64GB of storage.

The midrange TCL 30 V 5G is a Verizon exclusive with mmWave connectivity. It sports a 6.67-inch FHD+ LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate, stereo speakers, and a triple-camera stack with a 50MP primary lens. The 30 V 5G is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with 4GB of RAM and has 128GB of storage.

Both phones are expected to be available on their respective carriers in the coming weeks, so check back for dates and pricing.

As for tablets, TCL announced the Nxtpaper 10s. No, it's not the same E Ink-alternative Nxtpaper the company has been working on for years (though Strait told PCMag that TCL is still working to refine its next-gen display technology for that model). Instead, the Nxtpaper 10s is an LCD tablet with specialized eye protection. There's also a stylus in the box, and the display has a paper-like finish to make writing feel more natural.

A trio of child-friendly tablets, called TCL Tkee, come in three sizes, have a sturdy bumper case, and are preloaded with TCL Kids, a specialized UI with more than 20,000 educational videos, 400 storybooks, and over 50 kid-friendly apps. The Tkee Mini is the smallest of the bunch with an 7-inch display, and will sell for about $99. The company will also have 8- and 10-inch models.

The TCL 10L is built for basic tasks like video streaming, with a large 10.1-inch LCD and modest specs including a MediaTek 8167B chipset, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage.

Finally, the TCL 8 4G features an 8-inch LCD and LTE connectivity. It's powered by a MediTek Helio P22T chipset and 3GB of RAM. There's 32GB of storage, as well as a microSD slot that allows you to add up to 256GB of external storage.

After several years of creating solid yet affordable smartphones and tablets, it only makes sense TCL would make its first foray into the laptop market. At $349, the TCL 14 Go is an affordable but sleek laptop with LTE connectivity.

Powered by a Snapdragon 7c chipset and 4GB of RAM, the TCL 14 Go seems best suited for everyday tasks like word processing and online classes. It comes with 128GB of storage and ships with Windows 11.

True to its name, the TCL 14 Go has a 14.1-inch LCD. Resolution comes in at 1,366 by 768 pixels, with a 16:9 aspect ratio.

When we tested TCL's original Nxtwear glasses last year, we were impressed by their potential, but found their overall execution left a lot to be desired.

TCL's Nxtwear Air glasses sport much of the same hardware, but manage to do so in a notably slimmer form factor. There are some improvements with the lens and bridges as well.

Although TCL has yet to announce availability or pricing, Strait said the company is working to bring the glasses to the US and wants to offer them bundled with streaming video services as it did with the original Nxtwear in Australia.

Since no CES announcement feels complete with a concept item, TCL also introduced its XR Concept Glasses. The glasses have a MicroLED display with full-lens holographic waveguide technology. They can do many of the same things your phone can, including smart home automation, starting your car, live navigation, and real-time sharing at home or work.

While just a concept, TCL wants these glasses to be more than a novelty item. We have a feeling they'll make it out of the prototype phase once Meta and other software developers start releasing next-generation mixed-reality solutions.","{'uri': 'sea.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag Asia'}","[{'uri': 'smartphones@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'smartphones', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'he_covered_mobile@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'He Covered Mobile', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_ap/news/t/tcls-xr-co/tcls-xr-concept-glasses-want-to-replace-your-smartphone_mcjz.1200.jpg,0.1607843137254903,eng-7382870,False,0.8509804010391235,0.1607843137254903,379012500,1

During its virtual press conference, the company announced forthcoming availability of three handsets in its new 30-series: the US-only TCL 30 XE 5G and TCL 30 V 5G, and Europe-targeted TCL 30 5G.

Its higher-end V device will be exclusive to US operator Verizon and comes with a Qualcomm octa-core chipset, 4,500mAh battery, 6.7-inch screen, 50MP main camera and triple-camera set-up on the rear alongside a 16MP selfie-unit.

Although offering limited details on the other smartphones, TCL noted the 30 XE 5G would be its first 5G handset available on T-Mobile and the operator's sub-brand Metro by T-Mobile.

It did not provide pricing or availability details on the trio of devices apart from stating the two US ones are scheduled for release in the ""coming weeks"" with the European option coming ""soon"".

TCL plans to share details on the next releases in the 30-series at MWC22 in Barcelona next month.

The manufacturer expects its 30-series to comprise eight handsets released during 2022, claiming all would have ""impressive connectivity"" and ""rich design"" at a competitive pricepoint.

The latest 5G devices form part of what it is marketing as a vision of 5G for all, which includes an investment of $1 billion in 5G labs and development of a forthcoming Linkhub 5G home router.

Tablets and glasses

During TCL's wide-ranging presentation, which also covered TVs and home products, the electronics maker unveiled a prototype of an augmented and mixed reality glasses product, making it the latest challenger player to target a move into the potentially lucrative segment.

Other devices showcased for the first time at CES 2022 include the latest iteration of its ""paper-like display"" tablet, the NXTPAPER 10s.

Its new tablet options also include the 4G Tab 8, entertainment focused Tab 10L and series designed specifically for children - the Tkee Mini, Tkee Mid and Tkee Max.","{'uri': 'mobileworldlive.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Mobile World Live'}",[],https://www.mobileworldlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MWL_TCL_2022_CES_650.png,,eng-7382870,False,0.6196078658103943,,379012440,1

These new Ryzen 6000 Series mobile CPUs are leveraging TSMC's more efficient 6nm manufacturing process, and they're also the first processors to integrate a Microsoft Pluton Security processor.

Microsoft's new Pluton chip has been created in collaboration with AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, and it aims to improve PC security with the same technology already seen in Xbox consoles and Azure Sphere. Basically, Pluton-powered Windows 11 PCs will have a dedicated chip for storing sensitive information like encryption keys and credentials, which will make it much more difficult for attackers to access this data even if they have physical access to devices.

Overall, AMD announced no less than 20 new Ryzen 6000 Series processors today with the entry-level U-Series, the more powerful H-Series for gaming and creator laptops, as well as the Ryzen PRO 6000 Series processors which will power new premium business notebooks such as the Lenovo ThinkPad Z. The company's Ryzen 6000 Series processors will come with up to 8 CPU cores and 16 threads, and AMD promises up to 11% more single-threaded performance and up to 28% faster multithreaded performance over the previous generation.

AMD's Ryzen 6000 mobile processors also come with future-proof features including support for DDR5 memory, PCIe 4.0, USB4, and WiFi 6E. The chipmaker expects over 200 new laptops to use these new CPUs in 2022, which should be another good year for AMD. It's pretty remarkable to see AMD give Intel some serious competition in the laptop market, and it will be interesting to see if the latter will respond during its CES 2022 event later today at 10AM PT.","{'uri': 'onmsft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'OnMSFT.com'}","[{'uri': 'laurent_giret@onmsft.com', 'name': 'Laurent Giret', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.onmsft.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AMD-Ryzen-6000-processor.jpg,0.2941176470588236,eng-7380602,False,0.7490196228027344,0.2941176470588236,379012320,1

At the time, Microsoft signed an exclusive deal with Qualcomm but Windows machines running ARM have not been successful. As that exclusive deal draws to an end, Qualcomm is putting the blame of the failure on OEMs.

More specifically, the mobile chip giant claims OEMs simply got too greedy by charging over $1000 for a Windows on ARM device.

""One of the points that we were not satisfied with the early devices was the inadequate pricing,"" argues Miguel Nunes , Senior Director, Product Management at Qualcomm, in an interview with Golem.de.

Nunes says OEMs can choose what price they put on their products. However, those OEMs may have felt forced into a higher MSRP because of the cost to purchase Snapdragon 8cx processors. That is the chip that has been powering the Always Connected PC movement. Some reports say the chip costs as much as Intel CPUs, but without the same performance levels.

Still, the reality is if the devices were awesome, the price tag would not mean anything. Apple is not having trouble shifting Macs that cost thousands running the ARM-based M1 chip. It is a value proposition and not a cost one.

It is worth noting Microsoft is very much committed to Windows on ARM, including working with more chip companies. Qualcomm too still appears to be backing its Always Connected PC concept, which provides chips for Windows on ARM devices.

In December, the company announced the third generation of the Snapdragon 8cx, promising significant improvements. The new silicon is built on a 5nm process that promises a 40% increase in single-core performance. However, it is the multi-core performance that stands out, 85% better than the previous generation.

GPU performance has 60% gains, and 60% better per watt performance compared to a x86 chip.

You'll gain full access to all possible actions, including deletion, renaming, and more. All files and subfolders will also be under your name.

The Take Ownership context menu will set the currently active user as the owner of the files, though they must also be an administrator.

Mobileye and its parent company Intel may not be attending CES 2022 in person, but they are making some news.The Israel-based market leader in vision-based advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) has announced two new generations of chips and new or expanded partnerships with three automakers. The new EyeQ6 family is expected to launch in mid-2023 for ADAS and the EyeQ Ultra is expected to power level 4 automated vehicles from 2025.

Mobileye has dominated the market for vision-based ADAS since the original EyeQ chips shipped in 2004, but the company has faced significantly increased competition recently. Nvidia has been winning many production programs in recent years, especially in the Chinese market with both its Xavier system on-a-chip (SoC) for partially automated ADAS and its Orin SoC for more fully automated systems.

Qualcomm has also been gaining traction with its Snapdragon Ride family of SoCs which was selected by General Motors for new ADAS applications beginning in 2022 as well as the Ultra Cruise system coming in 2023. Like Mobileye, both Nvidia and Qualcomm are also supplying full software stacks for ADAS and automated driving with their SoCs.

Mobileye's current mainstream chip is the EyeQ4 which debuted in late 2018 and is in millions of vehicles on the road today. Among the capabilities of EyeQ4 is support for Road Experience Management (REM), Mobileye's crowd-sourced high-definition mapping system. Roadbook, the map product powered by REM is already being used by Nissan in the hands-free ProPilot Assist V2 that debuted in Japan in 2019 and is coming to the US market later in 2022 on the Ariya. REM data is also available to other map providers.

From mid-2023, EyeQ6 will become Mobileye's main ADAS SoC in two forms. The Eye6L is the entry level chip to power forward facing camera systems that are now on most new vehicles. It's a low-power chip designed single package, behind the windshield applications where minimal heat generation is required. This can enable automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist and hands-on lane centering solutions like Nissan's first-generation ProPilot Assist.

The EyeQ6H is for more full-featured hands-free systems with multiple surround-view cameras. It's performance matches the EyeQ5 SoC that is launching in production programs this year.

The EyeQ Ultra takes Mobileye performance to a whole new level. It features 12 CPU cores with 24 threads based on RISC-V archictecture. There are also GPU, vision processing and image signal processing cores and 16 convolutional neural network accelerator clusters. All in, Mobileye claims the Ultra is capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS). By comparison the Nvidia Orin can do 250 TOPS and most Orin applications are using either two or four SoCs.

However, the run performance numbers don't tell the whole story since the software that runs on these chips is very different. Mobileye has in the past claimed that its proprietary perception software runs more efficiently and doesn't require the same raw computational power. The target with the EyeQ Ultra SoC is to enable a single chip solution that can provide full level 4 automated driving capabilities for consumer level vehicles.

For comparison, the L4 robotaxi platform that Mobileye plans to begin pilot deployments of in Munich, Germany and Tel Aviv, Israel later this year uses a compute platform with 8 EyeQ5H SoCs. The Ultra is expected to match or exceed this performance at lower cost and power consumption. The first sample chips for Ultra are expected by the end of 2023 with full production slated for 2025.","{'uri': 'forbes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Forbes'}",[],https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F61d395c4f40289ae2700920c%2F0x0.png,0.3490196078431373,eng-7383201,False,0.7176470756530762,0.3490196078431373,379011780,2

While CES isn't typically the home to smartphone announcements -- Mobile World Congress (MWC) is -- display maker TCL joins Samsung by unveiling a series of new mobile devices. The 30 Series, which builds upon the successes of last year's 20 Series , features the TCL 30 V 5G and TCL XE 5G, a duet of 5G-enabled Androids set to arrive at Verizon and T-Mobile stores, respectively.

The TCL 30 V 5G will be a Verizon-exclusive device, boasting a 6.67-inch display with a 1,080 by 2,400 resolution. The big screen smartphone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 chip, 4GB of RAM, and a 4,500mAh battery, all of which TCL hopes will provide day-long usage. At the back of the device is a fingerprint sensor and a camera module that houses a 50-megapixel primary camera, a 5MP super-wide lens, and a 2MP macro lens. The front-facing selfie camera sports a 16MP lens. Flanking the side is a microSD card slot, expandable up to 1TB of storage, in case the internal 128GB doesn't suffice. With support for Verizon's 5G bands, you can expect the TCL 30 V 5G to cost anywhere between $300 to $500, making it a solid mid-range option if you're on the network.

T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile customers can exclusively look forward to the TCL 30 XE 5G. The device differentiates itself from Verizon's 30 V model with a smaller 6.52-inch display at 1,600 by 720 resolution, and a 90Hz refresh rate at that. We're continuing to see a trend of budget smartphones sporting higher refresh rate displays, which make the overall viewing and scrolling experience smoother. The TCL 30 XE 5G is also equipped with a Mediatek Dimensity 700 chip, 4GB of RAM, and a triple camera setup consisting of a 13-megapixel primary camera, a 2MP depth sensor, and a 2MP macro lens. (Basically, the phone shouldn't be your go-to if mobile photography and video is your passion.) Again, there is a microSD card slot that lets you expand from the existing 64GB of storage up to 512GB. And like Verizon's 30 V model, the phone houses a 4,500mAh battery. However, the charging speed -- a feature that has become a selling point for affordable 5G devices -- was not disclosed by TCL, nor was the actual pricing of the device.

TCL says that the two phones will begin to arrive in Verizon, T-Mobile, and Metro by T-Mobile stores in the US starting in February. Hopefully, that means we can get more details on pricing and availability soon.","{'uri': 'zdnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ZDNet'}","[{'uri': 'june_wan@zdnet.com', 'name': 'June Wan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/c8e68c587e7be139ff702e201872f280dd96a618/2022/01/04/737c6e28-ec80-4bbb-82d8-2997562a665e/tcl-30-v-5g-verizon-ces-2022.png?width=770&height=578&fit=crop&auto=webp,0.2313725490196079,eng-7382870,False,0.6745098233222961,0.2313725490196079,379010880,1

The reports show that there has been no major difference in the ranking in comparison to that of November 2021.

Things are likely to change this January, however, as we are looking at the launch of multiple devices equipped with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip.

The Xiaomi Black Shark 4S Pro maintains the top spot when it comes to flagship models. The gaming smartphone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip paired with 16GB RAM and has maintained the lead since October 2021.

The second spot is occupied by the Nubia Red Magic 6S Pro while the iQOO 8 Pro completes the top 3 best performing smartphones.

AnTuTu did mention that the lack of sufficient data was responsible for the absence of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1-powered phones on the chart despite the launch of two models, the Xiaomi 12 and Motorola Edge 30 Ultra in December 2021.

The models will in all likelihood dominate the rankings for January 2022 which we will see in February. Already, the models are on sale with the Xiaomi 12 Series recording a stellar sales performance in its first outing.

Coming to the midrange segment, Vivo's iQOO Z5 maintains its lead yet again despite facing intense competition from other brands.","{'uri': 'technosports.co.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechnoSports'}","[{'uri': 'sumedh_joshi@technosports.co.in', 'name': 'Sumedh Joshi', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.technosports.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FBkmjV3WQActIn1-1024x576.jpg,0.05098039215686279,eng-7386123,False,0.7803921699523926,0.05098039215686279,379010580,1

Alienware is calling this new Ryzen laptop the ""world's most powerful 17'' AMD Advantage laptop.""

Estimated reading time: 8 minutes

The Alienware m17 R5 is the result of a collaboration with AMD that combines an architecture that includes AMD Ryzen processors, AMD Radeon graphics options, and AMD Smart Technologies like AMD SmartShift MAX, SmartAccess Memory, and for the first time on any laptop, SmartAccess Graphics.

All M Series laptops come with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos certification providing an HDR visual experience and surround sound that are both designed by the studios that originally created the content. ComfortView Plus, our hardware based low blue light technology that that does not degrade picture quality is available on all configurations as well.

Each Ryzen configuration also includes our patent-pending Smart Fan control technology where each individual fan can independently spin-up, slow-down or remain steady according to various sensors within the system.

Using a complex, yet well defined and confidential set of parameters, gamers can select from five uniquely Tailored Power States according to their needs including : Full Speed (max power), Performance mode (graphics priority), Balanced mode (balanced CPU/GPU), battery save mode, and Quiet mode (acoustics priority).

Features three keyboard options with a 1.8mm key travel spanning a 1-zone AlienFX backlit keyboard, to a per-key AlienFX backlit keyboard, to the CherryMX ultra low-profile mechanical laptop keyboard with per-key AlienFX lighting.

AMD Ryzen-based Alienware M Series laptops offer the latest wireless technologies from Qualcomm. Now offering the Qualcomm Wi-Fi 6E WCN6856 Dual 2×2 Wireless LAN, gamers can enjoy up to 6Ghz bands with speeds reaching up to 3.6Gbps as well as the ability to simultaneously connect across two 2.4Ghz channels and two 5Ghz channels.

If AMD Ryzen technology in the latest Alienware laptop isn't exciting enough for you, then have a look at the world's first Quantum-Dot OLED gaming monitor. The AW3423DW's Quantum Dot Display Technology enables a slim panel design and delivers a superior color performance with a higher peak luminance and greater color gamut range vs WOLED (White OLED) by taking the impressive qualities of OLED (such as true blacks & infinite contrast ratio) and enhances color performance by directly converting blue light into the primary colors of red and green through a Quantum Dot pixel layer. This results in higher color uniformity, wider color coverage and increased brightness.

The monitor features an extensive cinema-grade color coverage of 99.3% DCI-P3 across a wide viewing angle, and colors are accurate out of the box with a factory calibration of Delta E<2. Combined with 1000 nits peak brightness, infinite contrast ratio and VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400 certification, you can expect incredibly realistic visuals for unforgettably immersive gaming experiences.

Experience ultra-low latency gameplay, support for HDR and cinematic color, plus smooth, tear-free gaming thanks to NVIDIA® G-SYNC® ULTIMATE certification.

Additionally, with the industry's fastest 0.1ms GtG (Gray to Gray) response time and up 175Hz (native) high refresh rate, you'll experience smooth gameplay and view fast-moving graphics with incredible clarity for a fast in-game reaction time.

The jaw-dropping new design features a sleek QD-OLED curved 1800R panel integrated into the iconic new Legend 2.0 ID, plus customizable stadium loop OLED AlienFX lighting, 360°ventilation for better heat dissipation, improved cable management and a new centralized OSD 5-Axis joystick to make adjusting your settings easier. The height-adjustable stand with height markers and the tilt, swivel, and slant capabilities allow for easy viewing adjustment.

For content creators and game developers who require precise color-critical work, the new Creator Mode feature was designed for you. This OSD menu option allows you the flexibility to choose between the native (DCI-P3) and the sRGB color space, depending on your work needs, and the ability to adjust the gamma settings.

What better peripherals to add to your AMD Ryzen gaming laptop and QD-OLED gaming monitor than a new gaming mouse and gaming headset! The new Alienware Tri-Mode Wireless Gaming Headset is designed to engross you in 3D sound with Dolby Atmos, 40-mm Hi-Res Certified Drivers, and Active Noise Cancelling (ANC).

Connect wirelessly to via the included USB-C dongle or Bluetooth 5.2, or via 3.5mm cable. AI Noise Cancelling Microphones enables clear communication in games or calls whether you are using the detachable boom microphone or the integrated mic, while touch controls on the right earcup allow users to control volume, track, call controls, and ANC on/off.

TCL is hitting CES hard this year, with an ambitious slate of products we hope to see make their way to the US. We're going to break it down by category to make everything easy to keep track of.

TCL teased its latest smartphone lineup, the 30-series, in advance of Mobile World Congress. Right now there are eight phones on the company's roadmap, including the TCL 30, TCL 30+, TCL 30e, TCL 30 XE 5G, TCL 30 5G, TCL 30 V 5G, TCL SE, and TCL 306.

We don't expect all of these models to come to the US, but Stefan Streit, TCL's general manager of global marketing, told PCMag that several of these handsets will likely make their way here. Eric Anderson, general manager and vice president of TCL Communications North America, also confirmed that the company has partnership agreements with every major US carrier, so you can expect to see a lot more TCL phones on store shelves in the coming months. That said, only the TCL 30 XE 5G and TCL 30 V 5G are confirmed for the US at this time.

The TCL 30 XE 5G is a T-Mobile exclusive that offers affordable 5G (though we don't know the price just yet). It has a 6.52-inch LCD with a 90Hz refresh rate, along with a triple-camera stack with a 12MP primary lens. The phone is powered by a Mediatek Dimensity 700 chipset along with 4GB of RAM and has 64GB of storage.

The midrange TCL 30 V 5G is a Verizon exclusive with mmWave connectivity. It sports a 6.67-inch FHD+ LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate, stereo speakers, and a triple-camera stack with a 50MP primary lens. The 30 V 5G is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with 4GB of RAM and has 128GB of storage.

Both phones are expected to be available on their respective carriers in the coming weeks, so check back for dates and pricing.

As for tablets, TCL announced the Nxtpaper 10s. No, it's not the same E Ink-alternative Nxtpaper the company has been working on for years (though Strait told PCMag that TCL is still working to refine its next-gen display technology for that model). Instead, the Nxtpaper 10s is an LCD tablet with specialized eye protection. There's also a stylus in the box, and the display has a paper-like finish to make writing feel more natural.

A trio of child-friendly tablets, called TCL Tkee, come in three sizes, have a sturdy bumper case, and are preloaded with TCL Kids, a specialized UI with more than 20,000 educational videos, 400 storybooks, and over 50 kid-friendly apps. The Tkee Mini is the smallest of the bunch with an 7-inch display, and will sell for about $99. The company will also have 8- and 10-inch models.

The TCL 10L is built for basic tasks like video streaming, with a large 10.1-inch LCD and modest specs including a MediaTek 8167B chipset, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage.

Finally, the TCL 8 4G features an 8-inch LCD and LTE connectivity. It's powered by a MediTek Helio P22T chipset and 3GB of RAM. There's 32GB of storage, as well as a microSD slot that allows you to add up to 256GB of external storage.

After several years of creating solid yet affordable smartphones and tablets, it only makes sense TCL would make its first foray into the laptop market. At $349, the TCL 14 Go is an affordable but sleek laptop with LTE connectivity.

Powered by a Snapdragon 7c chipset and 4GB of RAM, the TCL 14 Go seems best suited for everyday tasks like word processing and online classes. It comes with 128GB of storage and ships with Windows 11.

True to its name, the TCL 14 Go has a 14.1-inch LCD. Resolution comes in at 1,366 by 768 pixels, with a 16:9 aspect ratio.

When we tested TCL's original Nxtwear glasses last year, we were impressed by their potential, but found their overall execution left a lot to be desired.

TCL's Nxtwear Air glasses sport much of the same hardware, but manage to do so in a notably slimmer form factor. There are some improvements with the lens and bridges as well.

Although TCL has yet to announce availability or pricing, Strait said the company is working to bring the glasses to the US and wants to offer them bundled with streaming video services as it did with the original Nxtwear in Australia.

Since no CES announcement feels complete with a concept item, TCL also introduced its XR Concept Glasses. The glasses have a MicroLED display with full-lens holographic waveguide technology. They can do many of the same things your phone can, including smart home automation, starting your car, live navigation, and real-time sharing at home or work.

While just a concept, TCL wants these glasses to be more than a novelty item. We have a feeling they'll make it out of the prototype phase once Meta and other software developers start releasing next-generation mixed-reality solutions.","{'uri': 'in.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag India'}","[{'uri': 'smartphones@in.pcmag.com', 'name': 'smartphones', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'he_covered_mobile@in.pcmag.com', 'name': 'He Covered Mobile', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_in/news/t/tcls-xr-co/tcls-xr-concept-glasses-want-to-replace-your-smartphone_5r4m.1200.jpg,0.1607843137254903,,True,0,0.1607843137254903,379009920,1

We're going to break it down by category to make everything easy to keep track of.

TCL teased its latest smartphone lineup, the 30-series, in advance of Mobile World Congress. Right now there are eight phones on the company's roadmap, including the TCL 30, TCL 30+, TCL 30e, TCL 30 XE 5G, TCL 30 5G, TCL 30 V 5G, TCL SE, and TCL 306.

We don't expect all of these models to come to the US, but Stefan Streit, TCL's general manager of global marketing, told PCMag that several of these handsets will likely make their way here. Eric Anderson, general manager and vice president of TCL Communications North America, also confirmed that the company has partnership agreements with every major US carrier, so you can expect to see a lot more TCL phones on store shelves in the coming months. That said, only the TCL 30 XE 5G and TCL 30 V 5G are confirmed for the US at this time.

The TCL 30 XE 5G is a T-Mobile exclusive that offers affordable 5G (though we don't know the price just yet). It has a 6.52-inch LCD with a 90Hz refresh rate, along with a triple-camera stack with a 12MP primary lens. The phone is powered by a Mediatek Dimensity 700 chipset along with 4GB of RAM and has 64GB of storage.

The midrange TCL 30 V 5G is a Verizon exclusive with mmWave connectivity. It sports a 6.67-inch FHD+ LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate, stereo speakers, and a triple-camera stack with a 50MP primary lens. The 30 V 5G is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with 4GB of RAM and has 128GB of storage.

Both phones are expected to be available on their respective carriers in the coming weeks, so check back for dates and pricing.

As for tablets, TCL announced the Nxtpaper 10s. No, it's not the same E Ink-alternative Nxtpaper the company has been working on for years (though Strait told PCMag that TCL is still working to refine its next-gen display technology for that model). Instead, the Nxtpaper 10s is an LCD tablet with specialized eye protection. There's also a stylus in the box, and the display has a paper-like finish to make writing feel more natural.

A trio of child-friendly tablets, called TCL Tkee, come in three sizes, have a sturdy bumper case, and are preloaded with TCL Kids, a specialized UI with more than 20,000 educational videos, 400 storybooks, and over 50 kid-friendly apps. The Tkee Mini is the smallest of the bunch with an 7-inch display, and will sell for about $99. The company will also have 8- and 10-inch models.

The TCL 10L is built for basic tasks like video streaming, with a large 10.1-inch LCD and modest specs including a MediaTek 8167B chipset, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage.

Finally, the TCL 8 4G features an 8-inch LCD and LTE connectivity. It's powered by a MediTek Helio P22T chipset and 3GB of RAM. There's 32GB of storage, as well as a microSD slot that allows you to add up to 256GB of external storage.

After several years of creating solid yet affordable smartphones and tablets, it only makes sense TCL would make its first foray into the laptop market. At $349, the TCL 14 Go is an affordable but sleek laptop with LTE connectivity.

Powered by a Snapdragon 7c chipset and 4GB of RAM, the TCL 14 Go seems best suited for everyday tasks like word processing and online classes. It comes with 128GB of storage and ships with Windows 11.

True to its name, the TCL 14 Go has a 14.1-inch LCD. Resolution comes in at 1,366 by 768 pixels, with a 16:9 aspect ratio.

When we tested TCL's original Nxtwear glasses last year, we were impressed by their potential, but found their overall execution left a lot to be desired.

TCL's Nxtwear Air glasses sport much of the same hardware, but manage to do so in a notably slimmer form factor. There are some improvements with the lens and bridges as well.

Although TCL has yet to announce availability or pricing, Strait said the company is working to bring the glasses to the US and wants to offer them bundled with streaming video services as it did with the original Nxtwear in Australia.

Since no CES announcement feels complete with a concept item, TCL also introduced its XR Concept Glasses. The glasses have a MicroLED display with full-lens holographic waveguide technology. They can do many of the same things your phone can, including smart home automation, starting your car, live navigation, and real-time sharing at home or work.

While just a concept, TCL wants these glasses to be more than a novelty item. We have a feeling they'll make it out of the prototype phase once Meta and other software developers start releasing next-generation mixed-reality solutions.","{'uri': 'pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PC Magazine'}",[],https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05tLATDnYS8NPmKmlMNb49z-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1641298316.jpg,0.1215686274509804,,True,0,0.1215686274509804,379009560,1

Then join our Team! English native speakers welcome!

HP is introducing a new range of ProBook models powered by AMD Barcelo-U processors at CES 2022. While the ProBook 405 Series G9 devices are conventional form factor laptops, the Pro x360 435 G9 is a convertible. The Pro x360 435 G9 is designed for hybrid work scenarios with the convertible form factor allowing easy adaptability.

The HP Pro x360 435 G9 is powered by AMD Barcelo-U APUs. These are new refreshes to the Ryzen 5000 series that now includes Zen 2 Lucienne, Zen 3 Cezanne, and Zen 3 Refresh Barcelo. HP offers a choice of several Barcelo APUs for the Pro x360 including the Ryzen 3 5425U, Ryzen 5 5625U, and the Ryzen 7 5825U. The Ryzen 5 5625U and the Ryzen 7 5825U are also available in their Pro variants as well.

The Pro x360 435 G9 offers a 13.3 16:9 FHD IPS display that is available in three brightness options of 250, 400, and 1000 nits -- the 1000-nit option also offers HP SureView Reflect and HP Eye Ease for enhanced privacy and low blue light emissions, respectively.

Storage options range from 128 GB PCIe NVMe SSDs all the way up to 2 TB. Buyers can also configure the Pro x360 435 with up to 32 GB of dual-channel DDR4-3200 RAM. Port selection includes 2x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-As, 1x USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C with DisplayPort-out and power delivery, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x 3.5 mm combo audio jack, and a microSD card slot. Biometric authentication is facilitated by the optional IR camera or the fingerprint scanner.

As a convertible, the Pro x360 435 can be configured to offer two cameras -- a user-facing 720p camera (with optional IR) and an optional world-facing 5 MP sensor with auto-focus.

Networking is facilitated by either a Qualcomm WCN6900 Wi-Fi 6E or a Realtek Wi-Fi 6 WLAN card depending on the SKU, both with Bluetooth 5.2. A 3-cell 42 Whr Li-Pol battery that supports HP Fast Charge powers the internals.

HP said that the Pro x360 435 comes with HP Wolf Security for Business that offers a hardware-based always-on defense from the BIOS to the OS and apps. Combined with manageability features in Pro versions of AMD Ryzen APUs, Wolf Security is designed to make IT administration easy in remote hybrid work scenarios. The laptop is also designed to pass MIL-STD 810H testing.

The HP Pro x360 435 G9 will be available from April. Pricing details will be made available closer to launch.","{'uri': 'notebookcheck.net', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Notebookcheck'}",[],https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc3/HP_Pro_x360_435_G9_Media.jpg,0.1607843137254903,eng-7383244,False,0.7058823704719543,0.1607843137254903,379009440,1

With two new laptops, Lenovo is addressing a particular market at the high-end where excellent functionality and performance comes with sustainability and design.

The sustainability aspect might target new corporate policies promoted worldwide by investors and board members. It's a pretty good idea to have products that address such requirements as they might be a sway factor, everything else being equal.

This ThinkPad Z-Series will feature two display sizes: 13 and 16 inches, called ThinkPad Z13 and ThinkPad Z16, respectively.

Lenovo offers different materials and colors, including dark (vegan) leather and silver (recycled) aluminum options. Building with sustainable materials is excellent, but Lenovo also ships these computers in recyclable packaging, including some bamboo-based packaging that is compostable, which is even better than just recyclable.

Upon opening the laptop, it's apparent that the display has a high screen-to-body ratio (92.3% according to Lenovo), which is another way to talk about skinny bezels. This ratio is made possible by moving the webcam hardware into an independent module, which frees up space within the bezel.

That's a good idea. Other OEMs tried moving the webcam to the display's bottom, but that's not a great vantage point to film the user. And since the webcam module allows for more space, Lenovo has upgraded its camera hardware with a seemingly much better sensor and lens. We're curious to see the new imaging capabilities in action.

On the Z13, the full-size keyboard goes edge-to-edge, and you can see how compact the laptop's width is. The full-width glass palm rest is new for Lenovo, with a 120mm trackpad. If you've followed our Lenovo laptop reviews, you know that this is a significant size increase, although Lenovo has slowly inflated trackpad size in recent generations.

The upper area of the trackpad also serves as TrackPoint buttons, so all the typical ThinkPad input functionality is intact. A double-tap on the TrackPoint now opens a collaboration menu, and this is new.

The Z16 version has much more space around the keyboard, which seems to be used for the superior speaker system. Because of this, I expect the ThinkPad Z16 to feature significantly better audio output, but we'll see when we can take them for a spin.

Inside, both laptops are powered by AMD Ryzen processors. The ThinkPad Z13 has a Ryzen PRO U-Series and its integrated GPU, and it's a unique CPU SKU that AMD makes for Lenovo, with slightly higher performance than normal. The ThinkPad Z16 can be configured with optional discrete AMD Radeon GPU alongside its Ryzen PRO H-Series, so that's the one to get if you need serious graphics muscle.

AMD's CPU will also include a security unit compatible with Microsoft's Pluto architecture which is designed to move some security layer inside the CPU. Pluto makes things even more secure as some data could previously be attacked in-between the CPU and the motherboard chipset during transit.

All Windows-compatible CPU makers (AMD, Intel, Qualcomm) will have Pluto-compatible hardware, but it's an exciting security improvement nonetheless.

Overall, the new ThinkPad Z seems like a great addition to the ThinkPad family and goes after the high-end corporate ""thin&light + design"" laptop market with a very healthy competition (XPS 13, HP Spectre, Huawei Matebook, etc.). the Z Series could help Lenovo gain more share in a hotly contested area if successful, as I don't think other OEMs have pushed sustainability as far.","{'uri': 'ubergizmo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Ubergizmo'}","[{'uri': 'hubert_nguyen@ubergizmo.com', 'name': 'Hubert Nguyen', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i0.wp.com/cdnssl.ubergizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/05_ThinkPad_Z13_Hero_Rear_Facing_Right.jpg,0.4039215686274509,eng-7383156,False,0.8078431487083435,0.4039215686274509,379008960,1

Let's start with the TCL 30 XE 5G. It has a 6.52-inch display at 1,600 x 720 resolution and up to 90Hz refresh rate. With a 4,500mAh battery, it runs on one of Mediatek's Dimensity chips, the Dimensity 700, which have been designed to work better with AI tasks like image processing.

Talking of images, there's a triple camera system, but no need to get too excited. There's a depth sensor and a 2-megapixel camera, meaning that most of the work will be done by the single 13-megapixel main camera sensor. It'll be able to record video up to 1080p - another reminder that these are affordable phones first, impressive specs are less of a priority. Much less.

The TCL 30 V has a bigger 6.67-inch display, running at 1,080 x 2,400 resolution. That's more pixels than the 30 XE, but lacks the 90Hz refresh rate. Compromises! It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 chip -- again different to the XE - with a more substantial 50-megapixel primary camera working alongside a 5MP super-wide shooter and a 2MP macro lens. Unlike the notched front-facing camera of the 30 XE, the bigger 30 V has a pinhole in the screen for its 16MP selfie cam. It also has a 4,500mAh battery which should ensure it lasts the day, given the lightweight specs of the device. Both devices are coming exclusively to the US, but on different carriers. The TCL 30 XE 5G launches on T Mobile - date TBC - while the 30 V is landing on Verizon.

Adoption from two US carriers will make TCL's phones a more realistic option than in previous years. However, we're missing one big piece of the puzzle: how affordable they actually are. Expect to hear pricing in the coming weeks. If you're looking for bigger specs (and prices, possibly), TCL is teasing more 30 series news at MWC in Barcelona later this year.","{'uri': 'au.finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo7 Finance'}",[],https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tFbPYKCBonkwoWNJph4Gsw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NDc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b8017630-6d44-11ec-9e7f-170f0b0e36eb,0.1215686274509804,,True,0,0.1215686274509804,379008900,1

Dell has used CES 2022 to absolutely deliver on the Alienware front. The highlight is obviously this quantum dot, curved monitor.

The Alienware 34 curved quantum dot OLED monitor, uses Quantum Dot Display Technology, which, in case you've missed this, basically sees a bunch of quantum dots (nano-scale crystals) that absorb light, then re-emit it at a different, very specific, wavelength. It delivers a superior colour performance with a higher peak luminance and greater colour gamut range vs WOLED (white OLED) by taking the impressive qualities of OLED (such as true blacks & infinite contrast ratio) and directly converting blue light into the primary colours through a quantum dot pixel layer.

TL;DR: great colour, increased brightness.

Dell says combined with 1000 nits peak brightness, infinite contrast ratio and VESA Display HDR TrueBlack 400 certification, you can ""expect incredibly realistic visuals for unforgettably immersive gaming experiences"".

Some notable specs:

We'll let you know pricing and availability when we do.

Also announced this morning was the Alienware m17 R5 Ryzen Edition, Alienware m15 R7 (AMD) and a wireless gaming headset and mouse. Check 'em out below:

As we all know, Alienware M Series laptops are fundamentally about prioritising power and pure watts to its components with the idea of having gamers ""experience their favourite games with high frame rates and graphics settings maximised"".

This new m17 R5, Dell says, is the result of combining an architecture that includes AMD Ryzen processors, AMD Radeon graphics options and AMD Smart Technologies like AMD SmartShift MAX, SmartAccess Memory and SmartAccess Graphics (making an appearance here for the first time on a laptop, FYI). Dell said this is the most powerful 17-inch AMD advantage laptop to-date.

Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos certification and Dell's Smart Fan control tech also feature on this new beast, and with Qualcomm Wi-Fi 6E WCN6856 Dual 2×2 Wireless LAN, you can enjoy up to 6Ghz bands with speeds reaching up to 3.6Gbps, as well as the ability to simultaneously connect across two 2.4Ghz channels and two 5Ghz channels. Not bad.

The m17 R5 measures 298.71 mm x 397.3 mm x 26.7 mm and maxes out at 3.3kgs. It's available in one colour, 'dark side of the moon' (the Pink Floyd fan is still at Dell, I see).

We'll update pricing and availability for you soon.

Details are scant on the m15 R7 right now, but Dell told us during a briefing that the m15 is back and it's updated with new processors and new graphics cards. Of course, we'll update this with more info when it becomes available (as you read this I'm likely asleep), but for now, I'm pretty keen the m15 is back.

The Alienware Tri-Mode Wireless Gaming Mouse can be connected via a USB-C wireless dongle and will give you up to 140-hrs of lag-free gaming. Alternatively, get up to 420 hours with a Bluetooth connection.

Available in lunar light or dark side of the moon colours

And on the Tri-Mode Wireless Gaming Headset, Dell says Dolby Atmos Virtual Surround Sound delivers ""crystal-clear audio with three-dimensional precision, so you can react quickly and accurately to of-screen targets, even on the most chaotic of battlefields"".

The new central processing units (CPUs) offer up to 11% more single-threaded performance, up to 28% more multi-threaded performance, and up to two times more graphics performance compared to the Ryzen 5000 Series.

AMD showed off the chips at its virtual event at CES 2022, the tech trade show in Las Vegas. Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, kicked off the event.

""We've seen remarkably strong growth in PC over the last two years,"" Su said, noting the industry has shipped more than 350 million PCs in the past two years.

The new AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processors are built using TSMC's 6-nanometer manufacturing process technology and deliver better built-in graphics performance, offering 1080p triple-A gaming as well as good battery life, the company said. The built-in graphics enable the Accelerated Processing Units, which combine a centralized processing unit and graphics processing unit in the same device.

AMD also announced the new Ryzen 7 5800X3D desktop processor with AMD 3D V-Cache technology for elite-level gaming performance. And it previewed the new Ryzen 7000 Series CPU powered by Zen 4 architecture and using the new AMD Socket AM5.

""AMD is at the forefront of innovation in the PC industry, delivering unmatched experiences for creators, professionals and gamers,"" said Saeid Moshkelani, senior vice president of the client business unit at AMD, in a statement. ""The new AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processors bring remarkable efficiency for impressive battery life, unbeatable built-in graphics and optimized performance to deliver the best AMD has to offer to every type of notebook user.""

AMD has had an edge over rival Intel since it debuted its Zen architecture in 2017, as that enabled AMD's processors to do more tasks per clock cycle than it could before. That gave it an edge that AMD has executed over multiple chip generations.

The AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processors are built on the updated AMD Zen 3+ core, optimized to deliver good performance-per-watt. These are the fastest AMD Ryzen processors yet, with up-to 5 GHz clock speeds, up to 1.3 times faster processing speeds, and up to 2.1 times faster graphics than the 5000 Series, which debuted in 2021.

The Zen 3+ core delivers power and efficiency, through new adaptive power management features that adjust speed quickly, and new deep sleep states that help save on power. Compared to last-generation AMD Ryzen processors, the AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processors can use up to 30% less power for video conferencing. The Ryzen 6000 Series processors can deliver up to 24 hours of movie playback on a single charge in a cool, quiet laptop.

Featuring up to eight high-performance cores, each one capable of handling multiple tasks at the same time to deliver 16 threads of processing power, AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processors bring better performance to ultrathin laptop PCs.

AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processors are also the first mobile processors to feature RDNA 2 architecture-based built-in graphics. With a graphics performance up to twice as fast as the last generation, it's the world's first on-chip graphics that can smoothly play the vast majority of PC games in full HD.

Ryzen 6000 Series processors have integrated display engine, allowing for ultra-high resolutions and refresh rates. AMD Ryzen 6000 Series enables up to 70% faster triple-A gaming compared to the competition, AMD said.

The chips use advanced DDR5 memory for faster mobile computing, and they have upgraded peripherals support with PCIe 4.0 and USB4. They use AI noise cancellation to filter background noise, and work with Wi-Fi 6E solutions from Qualcomm and MediaTek.

AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processors are the first x86 processors to fully support advanced Windows 11 security features with the integrated Microsoft Pluton security processor, offering a secure system, enabling true chip-to-cloud security, Su said. This will ""eliminate entire attack vectors"" on the PCs, she said.

At the top of the product stack, the AMD Ryzen HX-Series processors provide optimal performance in a thin and lightweight form factor with incredible graphics power. For mainstream consumers looking for performance on-the-go, the AMD Ryzen 6000 U-Series processors offer a blend of performance and efficiency.

A reinvigorated line-up of AMD Ryzen 5000 Mobile Series processors, improving performance with the incorporation of ""Zen 3"" processor technology, is also available for 2022.

The first laptops powered by AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processors are expected to be available from partners such as Asus, Dell, and HP beginning in February 2022. Throughout the year, AMD expects broad availability of more than 200 consumer and commercial notebooks based on the 2022 Ryzen portfolio.

Also coming early in 2022, AMD Ryzen 6000 Pro Series processors will continue to build on a long line of firsts, delivering new features and technology for enterprises.

Together with AMD, Lenovo will introduce the new ThinkPad Z, a premium business notebook, featuring AMD Ryzen PRO 6000 Series processors, this spring.

AMD also announced an upgrade to the AMD Ryzen 5000 Series desktop processors, delivering the first AMD Ryzen processors with AMD 3D V-Cache technology to power gaming experiences. Powered by the Zen 3 core architecture, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D desktop processor is the world's fastest gaming processer, AMD said. It delivers an average of 5% faster 1080p gaming across select titles than the competition, AMD claimed.

The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D will be available for Socket AM4 later in the spring of 2022.

AMD previewed its Ryzen 7000 Series processors, which will be based on the 5-nanometer Zen 4 architecture and made available in the second half of 2022. To complement Ryzen Zen 4 architecture CPUs, AMD will also introduce the all-new AMD Socket AM5 to market.

""Zen 4 is the next big step,"" Su said. ""It's currently running in our labs, and the performance looks incredible.""

She said it will support new kinds of memory and other features. And she showed a demo of Halo: Infinite running at 5Ghz on the Zen 4 processor.

""Through partnership with AMD, we embarked on a journey to push PC gaming forward in innovation. The end result is a category-defining Alienware laptop that pushes the boundary of performance and smart experience,"" said Vivian Lien, vice president at Alienware, in a statement. ""With the latest AMD Ryzen processor technology powering our Alienware m17/m15 R5 laptops - which includes the most powerful 17-inch AMD Advantage gaming laptop in the world - users can expect the gaming performance and power to meet the demands of all modern game titles.""","{'uri': 'venturebeat.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'VentureBeat'}","[{'uri': 'dean_takahashi@venturebeat.com', 'name': 'Dean Takahashi', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/amd-ces-main.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,0.2078431372549019,eng-7380602,False,0.7803921699523926,0.2078431372549019,379007940,1

The Ryzen 6000 mobile CPUs are based on TSMC's 6-nanometer manufacturing process, and they mostly use AMD's new Zen 3+ architecture, which provides performance and efficiency gains over the Zen 3 architecture that was introduced in 2020. The ""high-performance, ultra-efficient"" architecture sports 50 new and enhanced power management features and an adaptive power management framework, which allows the new chips to support up to 24 hours of battery life, according to AMD.

""With that incredible performance, we're still able to deliver up to 24 hours of battery life for video playback, which is an enormous step over where we were last year and where the rest of the industry is,"" said David McAfee, corporate vice president and general manager of AMD's client business unit, in a presentation provided to journalists.

AMD expects the new Ryzen 6000 mobile processors, combined with previous-generation Ryzen 5000 chips, to power more than 200 premium laptops this year, with availability starting in February. The new AMD-powered laptops include Lenovo's ThinkPad Z and Legion 5 Pro, Acer's Nitro 5, Asus' ROG Zephyrus G14, Dell's Alienware m17 R5, HP's EliteBook 845 and 865 G9 and Razer's Blade 14.

The new processors support DDR5 memory as well as PCIe 4.0 and USB4 connectivity. They're also the first x86 processors to ""fully support advanced Windows 11 security features"" with Microsoft's Pluton security processor that is integrated on the chip's die. Those features are complemented by Wi-Fi 6E solutions from Qualcomm and MediaTek on a platform level.

Like previous generations, the Ryzen 6000 mobile CPUs are split into multiple segments: the U-series for ultrathin laptops, the H-series for gaming and content creation laptops, and the Pro series, which provides enterprise-grade security, reliability and management features for commercial systems. But AMD mostly provided details for the new U-series and H-series processors in its CES 2022 press conference and said the Pro series will arrive in early 2022.

While all eight of the H-series processors are 6nm and use AMD's Zen 3+ and RDNA 2 architectures for CPU and graphics, respectively, only two of the five U-series processors -- the Ryzen 7 6800U and Ryzen 5 6600U -- use the same process and architectures. The three other U-series processors are based on a 7nm process and rely on AMD's Zen 3 and Vega architectures that are found in older models.

The U-series is headlined by the Ryzen 7 6800U, which comes with eight cores, 16 threads, a maximum boost of 4.7GHz, a base frequency of 2.7GHz, a combined L2 and L3 cache of 20 MB, 12 GPU cores, a maximum graphics frequency of 2.2GHz and a TDP range of 15 to 28 watts. There are two Ryzen 7 and two Ryzen 5 processors in the lineup, with one of each using Zen 3+, RDNA 2 and 6nm while the other two use Zen 3, Vega and 7nm, resulting in lower clock speeds and less graphical power. The four-core Ryzen 3 5425U, on the other hand, is the only Ryzen 3 in the lineup and uses the older technologies.

Compared with the previous-generation Ryzen 7 5800U, the new Ryzen 7 6800U is 10 percent faster for single-threaded performance, 30 percent faster for multi-threaded performance and 30 percent faster for productivity performance, the latter of which is based on the PCMark 10 Extended benchmark that measures performance for a variety of tasks used in work settings.

When it comes to content creation, the Ryzen 7 6800U is even faster, according to AMD, providing 70 percent faster performance for video encoding and 2.3 times faster performance for 3-D rendering. As for power consumption, the gains are also meaningful, with the Ryzen 7 6800U using up to 30 percent less power for videoconferencing, 15 percent less power for web browsing and 40 percent less power for video streaming, the chipmaker said.

The H-series is headlined by the Ryzen 9 6980HX, which comes with eight cores, 16 threads, a maximum boost frequency of 5GHz, a base frequency of 3.3GHz, a combined L2 and L3 cache of 20 MB, 12 GPU cores, a maximum graphics frequency of 2.4GHz and a thermal design power of 45 or more watts. The rest of the H-series lineup includes Ryzen 9, Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 processors that go down to six cores, a 4.5 maximum boost frequency and a TDP of 35 watts.

With the Ryzen 9 6980HX hitting 5GHz for gaming laptops, the new processors feature AMD's ""fastest clock frequencies"" yet, according to McAfee. While previous Ryzen chips have been overclocked to 5GHz on desktops, the company has never before sold a CPU advertised with such a frequency.

While AMD has led the pack on multi-threaded performance for the past few years, Intel has mostly been ahead when it comes with single-threaded applications, first hitting 5GHz in a desktop CPU in 2018 and then hitting past the 5GHz threshold with multiple chips for gaming laptops in 2020. Intel then hit 5GHz for ultrathin laptops last year with its Core i7-1195G7.

AMD did not provide any competitive comparisons between its fastest Ryzen 6000 CPU, the Ryzen 9 6980HX, and Intel's comparable processor for gaming laptops, the Core i9-11980HK, which also sports eight cores and a 5GHz boost frequency. Nor did it make any comparisons to Intel's most powerful CPU for ultrathin laptops, the Core i7-1195G7, which was introduced last year.

However, AMD did compare its new top CPU for ultrathin laptops, the eight-core, 4.7GHz Ryzen 7 6800U, to Intel's Core i7-1165G7, which sports four cores and the same maximum frequency. For ""Doom Eternal,"" AMD said its new U-series flagship can provide up to three times more frames per second. For ""Counter-Strike: Global Operations,"" AMD said its chip is up to 2.5 times faster. It's also up to 80 percent faster for ""Fortnite"", 60 percent faster for ""Watch Dogs: Legion,"" 40 percent faster for ""The Witcher 3"" and 20 percent faster for ""DOTA 2,"" according to AMD.

What helped AMD lead the way across multiple games was the RDNA 2 architecture, which powers only two of the five new U-series processors and all eight of the H-series processors. In the competitive comparisons, AMD showed that the integrated graphics of the Ryzen 7 6800U could outperform Nvidia's GeForce MX450 GPU that is suited for thin and light laptops.

McAfee said with the inclusion of RDNA 2, the Ryzen 6000 series is the first family of APUs to feature hardware ray tracing. He was keen to point out that RDNA 2 is used in AMD's latest discrete graphics cards for gaming desktops as well as the backseat entertainment system for Tesla's new Model S and Model X cars. RDNA 2 also powers Microsoft's Xbox Series X console.

""This is really built to deliver a disruptive level of performance in ultrathin notebooks, and we think we've done that by bringing the best graphics IP that's used across the industry into our next-generation mobile processors,"" he said.

When it comes to generational comparisons, AMD said RDNA 2 helps the Ryzen 7 6800U outperform the previous-generation Ryzen 7 5800U by up to two times across multiple games, including ""Cyberpunk 2077,"" ""Back 4 Blood"" and ""Overwatch.""

The graphical capabilities of the Ryzen 6000 processors are even better when using AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution software, which upscales images to boost frames per second, according to the company. For the Ryzen 7 5800U with Super Resolution turned on, AMD boasted gains of 51 percent to 59 frames per second for ""Far Cry 6,"" 56 percent to 114 frames for ""Call of Duty: Vanguard,"" 35 percent to 73 frames for ""Deathloop"" and 29 percent to 61 frames for ""Godfall.""","{'uri': 'crn.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CRN'}","[{'uri': 'dylan_martin@crn.com', 'name': 'Dylan Martin', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.crn.com/resources/0271-141f29abbfd1-ded6c27f7ad0-1000/amd-ryzen-6000-mobile-series.jpg,0.4274509803921569,eng-7380602,False,0.7568627595901489,0.4274509803921569,379007820,1

Surprisingly, AMD is the first out of the door with CPUs featuring Pluton, beating Intel and Qualcomm to integrate the latest in Windows security features. Pluton is designed to block new and emerging attack vectors that are often used to compromise PCs.

Microsoft has taken its learnings from Xbox, which has physical attack protections, to try to bring similar protections to Windows PCs. Pluton is essentially an evolution of the Trusted Computing Module (TPM) that's baked directly into the CPU.

""Ryzen 6000 series will be the first PC processors that integrate the Microsoft Pluton security processor,"" explained AMD CEO Lisa Su during a CES 2022 press conference today. ""Our co-development work with Microsoft eliminates entire attack vectors on notebooks, better protecting critical data like system credentials, user identities, encryption keys, and personal information.""

Pluton will be included in AMD's new Ryzen 6000 series processors on a variety of laptops. AMD is also promising up to 69 percent faster video editing, more than double the 3D rendering performance, and double the 1080p gaming performance with these new chips. Full details on Ryzen 6000 are available here.","{'uri': 'theverge.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Verge'}","[{'uri': 'tom_warren@theverge.com', 'name': 'Tom Warren', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NGmaVYZC7M27Xq10PpVQiuLC-Ms=/0x14:1163x596/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22047672/ZwVORCZ.png,0.1215686274509804,eng-7380602,False,0.4823529422283173,0.1215686274509804,379007340,1

TCL also announced a pair of 1080p VR glasses which are unlike most VR headsets, a simple pair of glasses that use dual Micro-OLED displays. The glasses will support media, games, and will even work as a secondary display to PC monitors. The TCL NxtWear Air will also support detachable glasses that should make replacements easier.

TCL also announced its first-ever laptop at the event with the TCL Book 14 Go, which is a thin and light portable laptop aimed at professionals and students on the move. Powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, the laptop will be powered by Windows 11. The laptop starts at $349 at launch.

TCL also announced that it will be making more mobile devices this year. The first of these are the eight new TCL 30 series smartphones that will exclusively be available in the US.

The phones include the TCL 30 XE 5G and the TCL 30V 5G. The rest of the series is set to launch next month in a separate event in Barcelona. TCL also announced the TCL LinkHub 5G, a 5G router that supports up to 256 users and is targeted at everything from residences to schools.

TCL also touched on new Mini LED TVs that the brand will be launching later this year. These include new TVs that will support over 1000 local dimming zones as well as more TVs with 144Hz refresh rate support for gamers. TCL will also make more Smart TVs that support Google TV, allowing users to use all Google TV and Google Assistant features straight from their television.

The TCL Tab 8 4G and TCL Tab 10L are also new tablets that the brand will announce later this year as well as the TCL TKEE series tablets for kids that come with features like posture reminders and parental controls.

TCL also announced a number of new gaming-centric features with TCL Game Center which will be available on TCL TVs and in some regions the service will also link up with Google Stadia. Game Center will allow gamers to socialise more as well as do things like using their phones as controllers, although we still don't know what games all this will be compatible with.

A new Game Master mode optimises settings like VRR and ALLM (Auto low latency mode), while a new TCL Game Bar allows users to extend their vision at an aspect ratio of up to 32:9, among other features like a split-screen mode that supports up to four screens.

The TCL Home app will now let users control all their TCL IoT devices and services in one spot. TCL Home can now also be accessed from TCL TVs if you don't have a smartphone nearby. The brand also mentioned new products that will come later that will support services like Apple AirPlay 2.

Note that most of these products will be region-specific and we don't know which products will be coming to India.

That's a good deal less than the $499 Linksys Hydra Pro 6E, which launched just a couple of months ago.

The Hydra Pro 6 doesn't have Wi-Fi 6e, and hence delivers less throughput than its pricier sibling. That may not matter yet, as few devices can handle the 6-GHz band that Wi-Fi 6e uses, but many more will become available in the next couple of years.

Its specs are solid but unspectacular. The Hydra Pro 6 delivers a throughput of up to 5.4 Gbps on its 2.4- and 5-Ghz bands, sports two fixed antennas, can connect to up to 30 devices at a time over an area of 2,700 square feet and offers a guest network. On the back, it's got four LAN Ethernet ports, one WAN port and a single USB port, but we don't yet have the specs for the Ethernet connections.

On the software side, the Linksys Hydra Pro 6 supports the new WPA3 secure-connection standard, comes with parental controls and can update its firmware automatically. For a CPU, it uses the Qualcomm Immersive Home 216 chipset, which delivers up to six simultaneous streams.

Linksys already offers at least two other Wi-Fi 6 routers besides the Hydra Pro models. The entry-level Linksys MR7350 is even smaller than the Hydra Pro 6 and can be had for about $80, but it has a smaller range (1,700 square feet) and uses a cheaper MediaTek CPU.

However, the Hydra Pro 6's real rival is Linksys' own Max Stream MR9600, which has four antennas and a faster Broadcom CPU, but about the same range and throughput as the Hydra Pro 6. The Max Stream MR9600 has a list price of $399 but can be found for about $300, as it's now about a year old.

You can order the Hydra Pro 6 today on the Linksys website, and the company says it will soon be in stock at major retailers. We're looking forward to reviewing the Hydra Pro 6 to see how it compares with Linksys' other Wi-Fi 6 offerings.","{'uri': 'tomsguide.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': ""Tom's Guide""}","[{'uri': 'paul_wagenseil@tomsguide.com', 'name': 'Paul Wagenseil', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnE8DxrZTYoEYSygeJpUCK-1200-80.jpg,0.1529411764705881,eng-7383175,False,0.8745098114013672,0.1529411764705881,379006860,1

And now the company is introducing its first laptop: the TCL Book 14 Go is a budget thin and light Windows 11 notebook with a 14.1 inch display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c processor and support for 4G LTE networks.

It should be available in select markets for $349 starting in the second quarter of 2022.

At that price, you can almost forgive the laptop's relatively slow processor. What may be a little harder to overlook is the underwhelming 1366 x 768 pixel display, which might be (barely) acceptable on a $200 Chromebook with an 11.6 inch display, but which feels a little out of place on a $300+ Windows laptop with a 14 inch screen. At least it's an IPS display which should offer decent viewing angles.

The TCL Book 14 Go has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a 40 Wh battery for up to 12 hours of run time, and a fairly svelte design: the notebook measures about 0.55 inches thick and weighs 2.9 pounds.

Other features include support for WIFi 5, Bluetooth 5.1, stereo 1W speakers, two USB 2.0 Type-C ports, a USB 3.0 Type-A port, a 3.5mm headset jack, and a microSD card reader/nano SIM card combo slot. There's a 1MP camera for 720p video conferencing.

The laptop will ship with Windows 11 software.

TCL is also announcing a new tablet called the NXTPAPER 10s that will be available in Europe and China later in January for $249. The 10.1 inch tablet is the latest in a line of NXTPAPER devices that use TCL's anti-glare, sunlight-readable display technology that's not quite a match for E Ink when it comes to paperlike displays, but which the offers a full range of color.

The tablet features a 1920 x 1200 pixel display, a MediaTek MT876E processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage plus a 5,500 mAh battery.

All around, the Galaxy S21 FE very slightly remixes last year's $799.99 Galaxy S21 at a somewhat lower base price of $699.99. But considering it's so similar to the previous model and coming out so close to the Galaxy S22 launch, it's hard to recommend unless you're specifically looking to buy a dual-SIM phone.

The Galaxy S21 FE comes in four attractive colors: dark gray, green, purple, or white. It has the S21's beautiful basic design, with a matte back panel and the camera bump flush to the upper right corner, as opposed to the ""floating"" camera bump on the Galaxy S20 FE.

At 6.14 by 2.93 by 0.31 inches (HWD), it's a bit bigger than the standard Galaxy S21 (5.97 by 2.80 by 0.31 inches), although it isn't as big as the S21 Ultra (6.50 by 2.98 by 0.35 inches). From the front, it's really difficult to tell it apart from an S20 FE or a base-model S21.

The phone sports an IP68 waterproof rating and has a 6.4-inch, 120Hz 2,340-by-1,080 display with an optical fingerprint sensor underneath. There is no SD card slot and no standard headphone jack. The S20 FE had a SIM tray with an SD card slot on the other side; the S21 FE exchanges the SD slot for a second SIM tray.

Just like the Galaxy S21, the S21 FE uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and runs Android 12 with Samsung's usual extensions. Our model has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There is also a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.

The phone appears to be more aggressively thermally throttled than other Samsung models we've tested recently. Our first few benchmark runs gave results looking much more like the S20 series than the S21 series.

Checking with the CPU Throttling Test app, which slams the CPU for 15 minutes, we found the S21 FE throttled back faster and harder than either the S20 FE or the S21 Ultra. But a quick touch to the back of the phone showed the problem wasn't that it was running hot; it was that the S21 FE's firmware was keeping it cooler than either the S20 FE or the S21 Ultra. So this intense throttling can change with firmware updates.

In real-life use, the S21 FE got noticeably warm when playing the extremely high-powered mobile game Genshin Impact, and while the controls were very responsive, we felt like the frame rate was slightly jerkier than it should be. We get the feeling that some software optimization is still needed, but that's what happens when you test a phone before it launches (the S21 FE officially hits store shelves January 11).

The aggressive power management, along with the 1080p screen, helped give the phone good battery life even in 120Hz screen mode. We got 11 hours, 40 minutes of video playback time in our video rundown test, which should make for a full day's worth of use. The phone's 4,500mAh battery supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging.

The Galaxy S21 FE has a real dual-SIM slot, which is very rare on a phone designed for the US -- the slots even say SIM 1 and SIM 2. The model number is SM-G990U1/DS, which in Samsung parlance means ""US model, factory unlocked, dual SIM,"" which we've never seen before. Samsung confirmed that the dual-SIM model will be sold in the US. Carrier-sold models, tagged SM-G990U, have no SIM 2 slot. We've been told by carriers that the phone is physically eSIM capable, but may not have that function at launch.

That said, even on our SIM 2-capable model, the second SIM has been disabled in firmware. There is no option in the settings screen for a second SIM (or even an eSIM), and if you load only the second slot, the phone acts like it has no SIM at all. Samsung says it hopes to enable the functionality, but could not give a timeline.

Network-wise, the S21 FE has everything the S21 has and a little more: all models now come with millimeter-wave 5G (the S21 on AT&T and T-Mobile only had mid-band and low-band 5G). Still, AT&T and T-Mobile use so little millimeter-wave 5G, it's not a big deal.

More importantly, the Qualcomm X60 modem in the S21 FE supports the new C-band networks launching this month from AT&T and Verizon. The Galaxy S20 FE and earlier models didn't. That can potentially make for big performance differences in 46 major US metro areas.

We recently benchmarked Google's Pixel 6 Pro against the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, which uses the same Qualcomm modem as the S21 FE. We found the Qualcomm modem to be superior in terms of signal quality and performance.

As for calls, quality and volume are on par with Samsung's other recent flagships. Once again, there's not much new to see here.

The S21 FE shares a rear camera system with the S21. Its three rear sensors are a 12MP, 123-degree ultra-wide; a 12MP main; and a 8MP 3x zoom. But its front camera has been majorly amped up, from 10MP on the S21 to 32MP here. We compared it with the S20 FE to see how Samsung has moved forward, especially if you have an older phone.

The S21 FE's camera interface, and especially the fluidity of switching cameras, is much smoother than on the S20 FE. That comes down to improvements in the image signal processors on the Snapdragon 888.

All in all, photos taken in decent light on the S20 FE and the S21 FE look identical. The S21 FE has significantly better low-light performance, however, especially on the front camera. Selfies in low light taken with the S20 FE are a blurry mess; they're much better on the S21 FE. Outdoor shots show noticeably more definition at night on the S21 FE than on the S20 FE.

Here's the thing, though -- the same is true of the S21. (The S21's front-facing camera has fewer megapixels than the S21 FE's does, but it has similar low-light improvements.) And the S22 might be even better, for not much more money; we'll see very soon.

The S21 FE is a fine phone, but it's an odd product coming out at an odd time. Last year's Galaxy S20 FE was a hit for several reasons. The primary S20 line, released right at the beginning of the pandemic, was overpriced and buggy. The S20 FE fixed that, six months later, delivering a reasonably priced phone that worked beautifully.

But the S21 line was terrific, and the S21 FE is coming out right before the S22 launches; the current expectation for the Galaxy S22, which may have a $799 base model with mysterious, fancy new features, is February.

And the Galaxy S22 isn't the only new Samsung we'll be seeing within the next few months. The lower-cost Galaxy A33, A43, A53, and A73 are all expected to show up soon, making your Samsung decision a complex one.

There's not much for the FE to fix, and both our testing and the specs show it. There's little this phone does that a base-model S21 with a price drop doesn't do in a slightly more compact body. (The two exceptions are dual-SIM functionality and how all S21 FE models include millimeter-wave 5G, but outside of Verizon millimeter-wave is a rare technology, and the Verizon model of the S21 has it.)

Samsung says it's getting rid of the base-model S21 with the launch of this phone, which means the S21 FE's existence is probably more about arcane supply chain deals and marginal profit than about giving phone buyers anything new or useful. Once the S22 comes out, we're betting there will be a ton of lightly used S21 models on the market for less than the S21 FE, and without any real advantages, it seems smarter to pick up an S21 than this model.

If you're reading this in January and are shopping for a Samsung phone, our advice is to hold tight and wait for the S22 launch. Then we'll see what new features the S22 family has to offer and how prices on used S21 units drop, potentially below the $699 the S21 FE lists for. If you're reading this later in the year, we'll have clearer guidance in our Galaxy S22 review.

That said, the Galaxy S21 FE is a perfectly good phone, and if you need to use two lines at once, it's currently the only dual-physical-SIM flagship designed for US networks. That alone might be enough to seal the deal for you.","{'uri': 'sea.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag Asia'}","[{'uri': 'sascha_segan@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Sascha Segan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'his_favorite@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'His Favorite', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'texas_to_edmonton@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Texas To Edmonton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_ap/review/s/samsung-ga/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe_cxz8.1200.jpg,-0.003921568627450966,,True,0,-0.003921568627450966,379006380,3

The device marks the emerging Chinese brand's entry into the flagship smartphone market. It is accompanied by a slightly less powerful sibling, the vanilla Realme GT 2.

Realme seems to have thoughtfully planned the GT 2 Pro. The device packs a well-curated set of specifications that make it a very appealing proposition. To start with, we have Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor under the hood. The chipset is coupled with up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage. Realme also promises a 9-layer stainless steel vapor cooling for better thermal management and sustained performance.

On the front, we have a 6.7-inch 2K AMOLED flat display with LTPO 2.0 technology. It is a 10-bit display with a 1-120Hz variable refresh rate, 3216 x 1440 pixels resolution, 1000Hz touch sampling rate, 1400 nits of peak brightness, and HDR 10+ support. The phone has an A+ certification from DisplayMate. Realme is offering a Gorilla Glass Victus protection on top. The rest of the body features a bio-based polymer design.

For imaging, the Realme GT 2 Pro features a triple camera setup on the back. We have a 50-megapixel primary camera with ""all pixel Omni-directional PDAF (phase detection autofocus)"" and OIS (optical image stabilization). The 50-megapixel ultrawide lens is the world's only smartphone camera with a 150-degree field-of-view (FoV). There's also a 40X micro-lens that lets you take extreme close-up shots. The front-facing camera is a 32-megapixel sensor.

Realme has packed a 5000mAh battery with 65W SuperDart Charge support in its first flagship smartphone. Other key features include Dolby Atmos dual stereo speakers, NFC, and an under-display optical fingerprint scanner. The phone will boot Android 12-based Realme UI 3.0 from day one.

The Realme GT 2 Pro is currently only available in the company's homeland China. But the company says its first flagship smartphone will soon arrive in Europe as well. It hasn't provided an exact launch timeframe but sounds the wait wouldn't be too long. ""Europe and China serve as new dual engines under Realme's 'go premium' marketing strategy in 2022,"" the company states. There's no word on its availability in the US.

As for pricing, the Realme GT 2 Pro starts at CNY 3,899 (roughly $615) for the 8GB RAM variant with 128GB of storage. The 12GB+256GB variant will cost CNY 4,499 (~$710) while the 12GB+512GB variant will set you back by CNY 4,999 (~$790).

This avalanche of products was supposed to come not only from Microsoft but also from its partners, and while several devices have indeed launched in the last few years, Windows on ARM is yet to take off.

The reason is as simple as it could be: these devices are way too expensive, and it makes little sense to invest in such a platform at this price point when the Intel alternatives have a similar price.

Qualcomm's Senior Director Miguel Nunes has recently told Golem in an interview (via DrWindows) that the first Windows on ARM devices had what he described as ""inadequate pricing,"" so customers were reluctant to buy them.

Microsoft itself has tried to address this problem with more affordable Surface models, but of course, the entire ecosystem needs to follow in its footsteps and launch cheaper Windows on ARM products.

Major improvements since 2017

Launched in 2017, Windows on ARM has evolved substantially, so it now supports x64 emulation as well. Microsoft says it's continuously working with Qualcomm on evolving the platform even further.

""With developers increasingly supporting ARM64 apps natively, emulating x64 apps is an important step in our journey with Windows 10 on ARM. Through working with Qualcomm Technologies, Windows 10 on ARM PCs continue to deliver incredible battery life, connectivity capabilities with 4G LTE and 5G, and immersive experiences with AI acceleration, pen and touch capabilities - all features we believe to be more essential as we work, learn, and connect from home and other remote locations,"" the company said

Whether or not Windows on ARM would eventually become a hit is something that remains to be seen, but at this point, the price of the available devices is apparently the main thing that makes people walk away.","{'uri': 'news.softpedia.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Softpedia'}","[{'uri': 'bogdan_popa@news.softpedia.com', 'name': 'Bogdan Popa', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://news-cdn.softpedia.com/images/news2/qualcomm-says-windows-on-arm-devices-are-way-too-expensive-534628-2.jpg,0.1529411764705881,,False,0,0.1529411764705881,379005000,2

But considering it's so similar to the previous model and coming out so close to the Galaxy S22 launch, it's hard to recommend unless you're specifically looking to buy a dual-SIM phone.

The Galaxy S21 FE comes in four attractive colors: dark gray, green, purple, or white. It has the S21's beautiful basic design, with a matte back panel and the camera bump flush to the upper right corner, as opposed to the ""floating"" camera bump on the Galaxy S20 FE.

At 6.14 by 2.93 by 0.31 inches (HWD), it's a bit bigger than the standard Galaxy S21 (5.97 by 2.80 by 0.31 inches), although it isn't as big as the S21 Ultra (6.50 by 2.98 by 0.35 inches). From the front, it's really difficult to tell it apart from an S20 FE or a base-model S21.

The phone sports an IP68 waterproof rating and has a 6.4-inch, 120Hz 2,340-by-1,080 display with an optical fingerprint sensor underneath. There is no SD card slot and no standard headphone jack. The S20 FE had a SIM tray with an SD card slot on the other side; the S21 FE exchanges the SD slot for a second SIM tray.

Just like the Galaxy S21, the S21 FE uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and runs Android 12 with Samsung's usual extensions. Our model has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There is also a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.

The phone appears to be more aggressively thermally throttled than other Samsung models we've tested recently. Our first few benchmark runs gave results looking much more like the S20 series than the S21 series.

Checking with the CPU Throttling Test app, which slams the CPU for 15 minutes, we found the S21 FE throttled back faster and harder than either the S20 FE or the S21 Ultra. But a quick touch to the back of the phone showed the problem wasn't that it was running hot; it was that the S21 FE's firmware was keeping it cooler than either the S20 FE or the S21 Ultra. So this intense throttling can change with firmware updates.

In real-life use, the S21 FE got noticeably warm when playing the extremely high-powered mobile game Genshin Impact, and while the controls were very responsive, we felt like the frame rate was slightly jerkier than it should be. We get the feeling that some software optimization is still needed, but that's what happens when you test a phone before it launches (the S21 FE officially hits store shelves January 11).

The aggressive power management, along with the 1080p screen, helped give the phone good battery life even in 120Hz screen mode. We got 11 hours, 40 minutes of video playback time in our video rundown test, which should make for a full day's worth of use. The phone's 4,500mAh battery supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging.

The Galaxy S21 FE has a real dual-SIM slot, which is very rare on a phone designed for the US -- the slots even say SIM 1 and SIM 2. The model number is SM-G990U1/DS, which in Samsung parlance means ""US model, factory unlocked, dual SIM,"" which we've never seen before. Samsung confirmed that the dual-SIM model will be sold in the US. Carrier-sold models, tagged SM-G990U, have no SIM 2 slot. We've been told by carriers that the phone is physically eSIM capable, but may not have that function at launch.

That said, even on our SIM 2-capable model, the second SIM has been disabled in firmware. There is no option in the settings screen for a second SIM (or even an eSIM), and if you load only the second slot, the phone acts like it has no SIM at all. Samsung says it hopes to enable the functionality, but could not give a timeline.

Network-wise, the S21 FE has everything the S21 has and a little more: all models now come with millimeter-wave 5G (the S21 on AT&T and T-Mobile only had mid-band and low-band 5G). Still, AT&T and T-Mobile use so little millimeter-wave 5G, it's not a big deal.

More importantly, the Qualcomm X60 modem in the S21 FE supports the new C-band networks launching this month from AT&T and Verizon. The Galaxy S20 FE and earlier models didn't. That can potentially make for big performance differences in 46 major US metro areas.

We recently benchmarked Google's Pixel 6 Pro against the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, which uses the same Qualcomm modem as the S21 FE. We found the Qualcomm modem to be superior in terms of signal quality and performance.

As for calls, quality and volume are on par with Samsung's other recent flagships. Once again, there's not much new to see here.

The S21 FE shares a rear camera system with the S21. Its three rear sensors are a 12MP, 123-degree ultra-wide; a 12MP main; and a 8MP 3x zoom. But its front camera has been majorly amped up, from 10MP on the S21 to 32MP here. We compared it with the S20 FE to see how Samsung has moved forward, especially if you have an older phone.

The S21 FE's camera interface, and especially the fluidity of switching cameras, is much smoother than on the S20 FE. That comes down to improvements in the image signal processors on the Snapdragon 888.

All in all, photos taken in decent light on the S20 FE and the S21 FE look identical. The S21 FE has significantly better low-light performance, however, especially on the front camera. Selfies in low light taken with the S20 FE are a blurry mess; they're much better on the S21 FE. Outdoor shots show noticeably more definition at night on the S21 FE than on the S20 FE.

Here's the thing, though -- the same is true of the S21. (The S21's front-facing camera has fewer megapixels than the S21 FE's does, but it has similar low-light improvements.) And the S22 might be even better, for not much more money; we'll see very soon.

The S21 FE is a fine phone, but it's an odd product coming out at an odd time. Last year's Galaxy S20 FE was a hit for several reasons. The primary S20 line, released right at the beginning of the pandemic, was overpriced and buggy. The S20 FE fixed that, six months later, delivering a reasonably priced phone that worked beautifully.

But the S21 line was terrific, and the S21 FE is coming out right before the S22 launches; the current expectation for the Galaxy S22, which may have a $799 base model with mysterious, fancy new features, is February.

And the Galaxy S22 isn't the only new Samsung we'll be seeing within the next few months. The lower-cost Galaxy A33, A43, A53, and A73 are all expected to show up soon, making your Samsung decision a complex one.

There's not much for the FE to fix, and both our testing and the specs show it. There's little this phone does that a base-model S21 with a price drop doesn't do in a slightly more compact body. (The two exceptions are dual-SIM functionality and how all S21 FE models include millimeter-wave 5G, but outside of Verizon millimeter-wave is a rare technology, and the Verizon model of the S21 has it.)

Samsung says it's getting rid of the base-model S21 with the launch of this phone, which means the S21 FE's existence is probably more about arcane supply chain deals and marginal profit than about giving phone buyers anything new or useful. Once the S22 comes out, we're betting there will be a ton of lightly used S21 models on the market for less than the S21 FE, and without any real advantages, it seems smarter to pick up an S21 than this model.

If you're reading this in January and are shopping for a Samsung phone, our advice is to hold tight and wait for the S22 launch. Then we'll see what new features the S22 family has to offer and how prices on used S21 units drop, potentially below the $699 the S21 FE lists for. If you're reading this later in the year, we'll have clearer guidance in our Galaxy S22 review.

That said, the Galaxy S21 FE is a perfectly good phone, and if you need to use two lines at once, it's currently the only dual-physical-SIM flagship designed for US networks. That alone might be enough to seal the deal for you.","{'uri': 'uk.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag UK'}","[{'uri': 'sascha_segan@uk.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Sascha Segan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'his_favorite@uk.pcmag.com', 'name': 'His Favorite', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'texas_to_edmonton@uk.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Texas To Edmonton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_uk/review/s/samsung-ga/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe_3dx3.1200.jpg,-0.01960784313725494,,True,0,-0.01960784313725494,379004160,3

The computer, known as a domain controller in the automotive industry, will be specifically engineered for TuSimple's commercial self-driving trucks, and will power sensor perception and vehicle operation.

Nvidia will provide artificial intelligence expertise and its Drive Orin hardware, a chip specifically designed for autonomous driving capabilities.

The controller powered by Nvidia's chip will be installed in the autonomous trucks TuSimple is currently developing in partnership with manufacturer Navistar, targeted for production in 2024. read more

""We believe this move provides us a significant competitive advantage in speeding time to market,"" TuSimple Chief Executive Officer Cheng Lu said in a statement.

TuSimple said it will own usage rights to the controller's design, adding that it planned to work with an unnamed third party manufacturer to produce it.

Considered crucial in the development of self-driving, controllers allow automakers to centralize compute-intensive instruments such as cameras, radars and lidar sensors.

Instead of each sensor being equipped with an individual electronic control unit, the domain controller handles computing tasks centrally, saving cost and space and allowing software updates to take place remotely.

Other chipmakers, including Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), Intel Corp's Mobileye and NXP (NXPI.O) are also offering domain controller chips for the automotive industry.

Self-driving freight trucks, while still operating largely in pilot projects, have become a focus of the autonomous industry in recent years, facing fewer regulatory and technological hurdles and potentially offering a faster way to generate returns than passenger robotaxis. read more

TCL's concept has no release date yet because it's a prototype, but the company hopes to show a working version around Mobile World Congress in February.

TCL's glasses include a binocular micro-LED color display that uses optical holographic waveguide technology to display information and images. Waveguide is a widely used technology in AR smart glasses such as Oppo's recently announced Air Glass, and can even be found in glasses from Nokia and Vuzix as far back as 2013. TCL's concept glasses have a touch panel along the right side for navigation, and they're powered by a Qualcomm 4100 processor.

TCL is referring to the concept as XR glasses, indicating they will combine elements of augmented and virtual reality. Augmented reality displays digital images over your real world surroundings, while virtual reality headsets replace your surroundings with computer-generated imagery. Meta's Oculus Quest 2 is an example of a VR headset, while devices like the Magic Leap One and Google Glass are AR headsets.

The new concept significantly differs from TCL's NxtWear G smart glasses, which are meant to serve as a portable, wearable 140-inch screen for entertainment. The company also announced a more lightweight version of these glasses called the NxtWear Air at CES 2022.

TCL's prototype smart glasses are seemingly designed to take over a few of the responsibilities of smartphones and laptops. In some ways, they look like a refined, sophisticated version of Google Glass -- which never resonated with consumers and sparked privacy concerns. It's been almost 10 years since Google Glass was announced, and we still have yet to see a commercially successful pair of smart glasses. (Google eventually pivoted its approach with Glass to target enterprise consumers instead.)

Stefan Streit, TCL's chief marketing officer, is well aware of the challenges that come with developing a new type of wearable computer. That's why the company's smart glasses are just in the concept stage right now. The company is still figuring out key details -- like how the interface should work and what types of services and apps make sense -- but it's also taking privacy concerns into consideration, which could help it avoid the criticisms that Google Glass faced.

""We feel like there are still a lot of question marks [with] how this works in this AR world,"" Streit said to CNET. ""And they are not answered yet.""

Head-mounted computers like virtual reality goggles are still far from being as ubiquitous as the smartphone, but the industry is certainly growing. According to the International Data Corporation, global shipments of VR headsets grew 52.4% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021 alone, thanks in part to the popularity of VR gaming and fitness apps. Meta is currently the biggest player in the industry with almost 75% of the market, according to the IDC.

Though TCL is best known for its televisions, it is still relatively new to the US smartphone market, which is largely dominated by Apple and Samsung. The introduction of AR smart glasses, even as a concept, signals that TCL doesn't want to miss out on what may be the next major evolution of the personal computer.

The company surely isn't alone in that regard. Snapchat's parent company, Snap, also unveiled AR smart glasses that can map 3D effects onto the wearer's surroundings in May. Meta launched a pair of camera glasses in September called the Ray-Ban Stories, which it views as a step toward a more ambitious pair of AR-enabled smart glasses. Apple is also rumored to be working on a pair of AR smart glasses, according to Bloomberg, although it might not launch for years.","{'uri': 'cnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNET'}","[{'uri': 'lisa_eadicicco@cnet.com', 'name': 'Lisa Eadicicco', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/SMm-kRvaG_wzlSfTf6nW-CCU_DE=/1200x630/2021/12/30/1a9338c4-68e5-4e65-aeec-e12e65241875/lno-4.jpg,0.2313725490196079,eng-7379690,False,0.5803921818733215,0.2313725490196079,379001760,1

The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G Olympic Games Edition has been launched in China and it is a special edition version of an existing Samsung device.

The handset comes with a range of Olympic-inspired wallpapers and a custom theme and it is only going to be available in China.

As a reminder the device comes with a 6.7-inch folding display with an FHD+ resolution of 2640 x 1080 pixels, there is also a secondary 1.9-inch cover display with a resolution of 260 x 512 pixels.

The handset features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 mobile processor and it features 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.

It also comes with a 10-megapixel Selfie camera on the front and there are dual rear cameras on the back, this includes a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera. The handset also comes with a 3300 mAh battery and fast charging.

The handset will go on sale in China on the 15th of January 2022 and it will retail for CNY 7,999 which is about $1,258 at the current exchange rate.

Let's start with the TCL 30 XE 5G. It has a 6.52-inch display at 1,600 x 720 resolution and up to 90Hz refresh rate. With a 4,500mAh battery, it runs on one of Mediatek's Dimensity chips, the Dimensity 700, which have been designed to work better with AI tasks like image processing.

Talking of images, there's a triple camera system, but no need to get too excited. There's a depth sensor and a 2-megapixel camera, meaning that most of the work will be done by the single 13-megapixel main camera sensor. It'll be able to record video up to 1080p - another reminder that these are affordable phones first, impressive specs are less of a priority. Much less.

The TCL 30 V has a bigger 6.67-inch display, running at 1,080 x 2,400 resolution. That's more pixels than the 30 XE, but lacks the 90Hz refresh rate. Compromises! It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 chip -- again different to the XE - with a more substantial 50-megapixel primary camera working alongside a 5MP super-wide shooter and a 2MP macro lens. Unlike the notched front-facing camera of the 30 XE, the bigger 30 V has a pinhole in the screen for its 16MP selfie cam. It also has a 4,500mAh battery which should ensure it lasts the day, given the lightweight specs of the device. Both devices are coming exclusively to the US, but on different carriers. The TCL 30 XE 5G launches on T Mobile - date TBC - while the 30 V is landing on Verizon.

Adoption from two US carriers will make TCL's phones a more realistic option than in previous years. However, we're missing one big piece of the puzzle: how affordable they actually are.

It's a 14.1-inch Windows 11 laptop that's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, with a 12-hour battery life and 4G LTE connectivity. While Snapdragon laptops are traditionally on the pricier side, the Book 14 Go will only set you back $349 when it launches in select regions in the second quarter.

The company was likely able to keep its price down, in part because it's powered by Qualcomm's affordable Snapdragon 7c platform meant for use with entry-level PCs and Chromebooks. Snapdragon 7c enables both LTE connectivity and lengthy battery life for laptops meant to be always switched on. TCL designed the Book 14 Go to be portable, with a depth of 13.95 mm and a body that weighs 2.9 pounds.

In addition to its first laptop, TCL has also announced its new NXTPAPER tablet, the 10s. The NXTPAPER 10s features the brand's full color paper-like display technology, which is a low-power reflective LCD that doesn't need backlighting. It has an anti-glare finish that allows you see what's playing from any angle and reduces blue light by over 50 percent. TCL says the display's attributes make looking at the screen more comfortable, thereby making it ideal for studying and for taking notes with its accompanying T Pen stylus. The NXTPAPER 10s will initially be available later this month in Europe and China for $249.

TCL will also release a pair of budget tablets, the $129 TAB 8 4G and the $99 TAB 10L, in the first quarter. If you're looking for even cheaper tablets for kids, it will release the $89 MINI, $149 MID and $119 MAX tablets in the same quarter for select markets, as well. All new tablets will come with support for the TCL Kids service that's launching in the second quarter to give subscribers access to a child-friendly library of educational and entertainment videos, storybooks and apps for $4 a month.

TCL might be best known for products like TVs and smartphones but the Chinese firm is branching out into laptops with the Book 14 Go powered by Windows 11 and a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.

While the firm just announced no less than eight 30 Series phones, the Book 14 Go is a lone effort to begin TCL's foray into the world of laptops. It's aimed at students and young adults with a budget-friendly price of just US$349.

Despite this low price, the Book 14 Go appears to be fairly well equipped starting with a metal frame and slim bezel. The laptop is just 1.3kg in weight making it very portable and TCL says it's one of the thinnest in its price range at just 13.95mm.

The Book 14 Go has a 14.1in display and it's just HD in resolution (1366x768). There's no mention of anything regarding colour reproduction and brightness so like many cheap laptops, the display could be the main downside.

TCL states a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c ARM-based architecture ""makes it easy to turn the laptop on in a flash"" but doesn't comment on what kind of performance to expect apart from the mention of virtual desktops on Windows 11.

The laptop will offer up to 12 hours of battery life, though, along with 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. There's also Bluetooth 5.1, USB-C and a 1Mp webcam.

Surprisingly for this price, the Book 14 Go has both Wi-Fi and 4G connectivity and can seamlessly switch between them depending on what is available.

This is likely what helps the TCL laptop stand out in the budget market where it will compete with rivals like the Acer Swift 1, Lenovo IdeaPad 3i 14 and Microsoft Surface LE. In fact, the price and inclusion of 4G make the Book 14 Go very similar to the Samsung Galaxy Book Go.","{'uri': 'techadvisor.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Tech Advisor'}","[{'uri': 'chris_martin@techadvisor.com', 'name': 'Chris Martin', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/features/3812042/tcl_book_14_go_laptop_thumb800.jpg,0.0980392156862746,eng-7382870,False,0.4509803950786591,0.0980392156862746,379001400,2

TCL is kicking off the new year and CES with a slew of affordable gadgets, including its first-ever laptop. Yes, the TCL Book14 GO is the brand's first laptop, which runs Windows 11 and will retail for only $349 when it arrives later this year. Then, the company has several impressive new budget-friendly 5G smartphones headed to Verizon and T-Mobile.

In 2021 TCL attacked the US market with a set of cheap Android phones, a tablet that undercut Samsung, and more, and they're not showing any signs of slowing down. And while its phones certainly aren't high-end, they offer all the usual bells and whistles at affordable price points.

Announced at CES 2022 is the all-new TCL Book14 Go, a 14-inch Windows 11 laptop built to help you get more done without breaking the bank. Given the low $349 price point, TCL's first laptop comes with a 14-inch 720p HD display, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7c chip for computers, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. Buyers will also enjoy an array of peripheral options, including a 3.5mm headphone jack, USB A/C ports, a MicroSD slot, and a 1MP front-facing camera for Zoom calls.

The company also confirmed it'll offer fast PD USB-C charging and upwards of 10-12 hours per charge. As you can see, this is very much the definition of a budget Windows laptop. You're not getting the latest and greatest premium designs, a fast 8-core processor, nor upwards of 16GB of RAM. However, this is certainly a compelling-looking device for students or those on a budget and lines up nicely with other budget offerings from HP and Dell.

During the announcement at CES, TCL confirmed that its first-ever laptop should retail for around $349 and be available in select regions starting in Q2 of 2022.

Then, TCL didn't stop with the laptop and shared the news regarding a trio of affordable Android smartphones headed for Verizon and T-Mobile.

Building on the success of devices like the TCL 20 Pro 5G and other mid-range phones, today, TCL unveiled the new TCL 30 V 5G for Verizon and the TCL 30 XE 5G for T-Mobile. Both devices offer large, vibrant HD displays, plenty of power, triple rear cameras, and 5G speeds.

First up is TCL's latest 5G-ready phone for Verizon Wireless. The new TCL 30 V 5G offers a big 6.67-inch 1080p HD display, Android 11, a micro-SD slot, and 128GB of storage. In addition, the phone is powered by Qualcomm's entry-level Snapdragon 480 processor and 4GB of RAM, meaning we can expect a reasonably cheap price point.

As you can see, the TCL 30 V 5G comes with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, and those triple cameras include a primary 50MP sensor for improved photography. Better yet, this phone has a 3.5mm headphone jack, something of a rarity these days, a large 4,500 mAh battery, and 18w fast-charging technology. It supports Verizon UWB 5G and will be available in the coming weeks. TCL didn't share pricing, but we'll know more soon.

Additionally, those on T-Mobile can opt for the new TCL 30 XE 5G, which should be even more affordable, yet has a few fancy upgrades along with support for T-Mobile and Metro. This device packs a slightly smaller 6.52-inch 720p HD display with a higher 90Hz refresh rate. You'll also get a lower-end 13MP primary camera, along with two more 2MP rear cameras for macro and depth-sensing.

Just like the earlier option, T-Mobile's TCL 30 XE 5G comes with a large 4,500 mAh battery, 18w fast charging, 3.5mm headphone jack, 64GB of storage, and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. It's an interesting package of both new and old tech, and will likely be pretty affordable when it arrives in the coming weeks.

TCL didn't share release dates for any of these products and only briefly mentioned the price of its new laptop, so stay tuned for more details. The company also shared details on a new TCL Tab 8 4G, TCL Tab 10L, and some NXTWEAR Air VR glasses for the European market.","{'uri': 'reviewgeek.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'reviewgeek.com'}",[],https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/12/abba6da6.jpg,0.1058823529411765,eng-7382870,False,0.7764706015586853,0.1058823529411765,379001400,2

TCL 30 XE 5G

Starting off with the TCL 30 XE 5G, this is going to be the phone for those who don't want a massive screen. That's because the 30 XE 5G uses a 6.52-inch HD+ display, complete with a 90Hz refresh rate. Keeping with the trend of recent releases, the TCL 30 XE offers a V-notch display, which is used to house the 8MP selfie camera.

Display: 6.52-inch HD+ Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 700 RAM: 4GB Storage: 64GB (expandable via microSD card up to 512GB) Front Camera: 8MP Rear Cameras: 13MP (main) / 2MP (depth) / 2MP (macro) Battery: 4,500mAh w/ 18W Fast Charging Software: Android 11 Extras: 3.5mm headphone jack, Bluetooth 5.1, 90Hz refresh rate, 180Hz Touch Sampling Rate

Under the hood, the 30 XE 5G is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 700 chipset and is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. While that may not seem like a lot of storage, especially in 2022, TCL is including a microSD card slot that can house up to a 512GB card.

Moving to the back of the phone, we have a triple camera setup housed in a traditional rectangular bump. There's a 13MP main camera, along with the over-used 2MP depth sensor and 2MP macro lens.

Luckily, TCL isn't ready to adopt the under-display fingerprint scanner, instead providing a more-traditional rear-mounted sensor instead. The 30 XE 5G also offers Face Unlock for those who want to add another layer of biometric security, albeit a less-secure option.

Battery life should be an absolute beast thanks to the combination of the HD+ resolution and 4,500mAh battery. You won't find super-fast wired charging, and there isn't any wireless charging anywhere. But TCL is still including 18W charging speeds to get you juiced back up in less than 2.5 hours.

TCL 30 V 5G

The TCL 30 XE 5G isn't the only phone making its debut from the company at CES, as the TCL 30 V 5G is also being announced. This phone offers a slightly-larger display, coming in at 6.67-inches and sporting an FHD+ resolution. Unlike the 30 XE, the 30 V does not come equipped with faster refresh rates, instead, sticking with the standard 60Hz that is found on many entry-level devices.

Display: 6.67-inch FHD+ Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G RAM: 4GB Storage: 128GB (expandable via microSD card up to 1TB) Front Camera: 16MP Rear Cameras: 50MP (main) / 5MP (super wide) / 2MP (macro) Battery: 4,500mAh w/ 18W Fast Charging Software: Android 11 Extras: 3.5mm headphone jack, Bluetooth 5.1, 60Hz refresh rate

Powering the 30 V 5G is the Snapdragon 480 5G, paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Not only does the 30 V offer more base storage, but you can also enjoy up to an additional 1TB thanks to the microSD card slot.

On the front, we have an upgraded 16MP selfie camera, found in the hole-punch cutout at the top. On the back, TCL is including another triple camera setup, but this time we have a main 50MP camera. This is accompanied by a 5MP ""super-wide"" lens along with a 2MP macro sensor.

Biometrics are handled by a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, along with the ability to use Face Unlock if you see fit. Thanks to the 4,500mAh cell and 18W charging speeds, TCL claims the 30 V 5G will be able to easily last through the entire day. But there's also ""On-The-Go reverse charging"" if you need to juice up your headphones or fitness tracker.

Surprisingly, the availability of these two devices is a bit weird. Both the TCL 30 XE 5G and 30 V 5G will launch ""in the coming weeks"". But the former will first be available through T-Mobile for a limited time, while the latter is coming to Verizon. Both of these devices are expected to arrive on more carriers later in the year.

Pricing for these new devices has not yet been shared, but we'll be sure to provide that information once it becomes available.","{'uri': 'phandroid.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Phandroid - Android News and Reviews'}",[],https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TCL-30-XE-5G_5-640x452.jpg,0.06666666666666665,eng-7382870,False,0.6196078658103943,0.06666666666666665,379001340,1

Additionally, it comes with an integrated GPU, which boosts the overall graphics and makes photo and video editing applications run smoothly. The tablet is compatible with the Apple Pencil (2nd Gen), allowing students to take notes conveniently. Thanks to its high refresh rate, a top-notch display, and powerful processor, it almost feels like writing on paper with a pen.

The battery lasts for about 10 hours on a single charge, which is enough to carry you through a day's worth of work. Moreover, the tablet weighs about 1.5lbs, making it easy to carry all day long without tiring. Besides its top-quality cameras, the tablet has a USB-C port, 8GB RAM, and 256GB storage (both are extendable).

The iPad mini promises efficient, fast, smooth, and consistent performance. Needless to say, Apple has packed it with components that ensure trouble-free operation. The tablet comes with an A15 Bionic chip with a 6-core CPU. It's the same chip that's powering Apple's iPhone 13 Pro. The chip's 16-core neural engine can perform 15.8 trillion operations in mere seconds, making it 43 percent faster than its predecessor.

This system is powerful enough to run all applications released to date smoothly. Furthermore, the iPad mini runs the latest version of Apple's operating system, iPadOS 15. The OS comes with the latest multitasking features, versatile widgets, quick notes, and a focus mode to reduce distractions. This allows students to maximize their productivity and concentration.

The Apple Pencil compatibility makes it easier for students to take notes. It also helps tailor visually appealing artworks for presentations and assignments. Students working on AutoCAD, Rhino 3D, and SketchUp would find the stylus easier to maneuver for a smoother drawing experience.

The battery life is long enough to last you through the entire day. With a weight of just 0.65lbs, you'll remain comfortable carrying the tablet all day long. Additionally, the iPad mini offers an expandable storage capacity of 256GB and 4GB RAM. Both the rear and front 12MP cameras are decent enough for casual photography.

In addition to serving as a tablet, Lenovo Yoga also functions as a smart display. Thus, besides being an exceptional work tablet for students, it also serves as an entertainment unit. Best of all, it incorporates Google Assistant and great speakers. In addition, the tablet is powered by a Snapdragon 439 processor and 4GB RAM.

Although it isn't a powerhouse, it gets you through a tough day's work. MS Office and a light image editor run smoothly and seamlessly on the device. But, it isn't suitable for heavy-duty applications like Photoshop and Illustrator. The Lenovo launcher uses Android 9.0 Pie as its operating system. It adds a few useful widgets to make users' lives easier. If you prefer a minimalistic display, you can disable these widgets from the settings.

The overall performance of the operating system is quite good. However, it may not support some new applications since it is dated. The device's audio system is above-average for its price, so it's appealing to remote students. It is equipped with three sensitive microphones to recognize the voice from a distance and deliver it. Using this tablet would significantly improve your online communications.

Huawei launched the MatePad Pro in 2021 as one of its premium devices. Compact and light, it is the ideal device to carry around campus. Its 10.8-inch display, punch-hole selfie camera, flash-supported rear camera, and Huawei's top-of-the-line chip make it a worthwhile investment. The tablet is powered by a Kirin 990 5G chip, an upgraded version of Kirin 990 used in Mate 30 and 30 Pro.

The new chip has better AI capabilities, faster clock rates, and, above all, better power efficiency. In video-editing applications or heavy-duty games, the chip never disappoints. Huawei uses HarmonyOS 2.0 as the operating system for MatePad Pro. The operating system consumes a small amount of RAM and is not very demanding on the processor. Even when running heavy-duty applications, the users get a seamless and lag-free experience.

The 10.8-inch screen with high resolution looks incredible, displaying details with exquisite sharpness. Natural and accurate colors also ensure that what you see on the screen is exactly what you get from the printer. Furthermore, it supports a stylus to take notes with maximum control. It would be a blessing for students who work with artwork and graphics. Moreover, there are two decent cameras on the tablet, ample storage and RAM, and a long-lasting battery.

The Google App store is also full of applications that students can use for their assignments and presentations without lagging.

You probably know TCL for its value-friendly TVs and smartphones, but now you might come across the company the next time you're searching for a new laptop.

TCL is expanding into a new category with the Book 14 Go, an inexpensive 14.1-inch clamshell laptop designed for students. I haven't seen this in person but it seems to have a simple, clean design with what looks like lavender or baby blue finish. TCL calls it ""skywriting,"" which sounds cool but doesn't help describe the color.

Either way, I'm glad the chassis is made of metal, an upgrade over what you get from other sub-$500 laptops. While the lid and underside are colored, the entire deck is black, from the keys to the touchpad. The keyboard seems pretty standard, the touchpad is a nice size, and at 0.55 inches thick and 2.9 pounds, the Book 14 Go should easily slip into a backpack or briefcase.

What I'm most concerned about is the 14.1-inch display with its 1366 x 768 resolution. I want nothing more than for these panels to go extinct, so to see one on such a large screen troubles me. After all, TCL of all companies should know how cheap 1080p panels have become.

You also shouldn't expect the fastest performance out of the Book 14 Go, which uses a Snapdragon 7c SoC to drive Windows 11. This low-power chip enables long battery life and 4G LTE connectivity in a mobile package, but isn't meant to run anything too demanding. The Book 14 Go is for students, so any benchmarks shortcomings will be forgiven if it can power Windows and a few Google Chrome tabs without slowing down. Qualcomm's chip is paired with Adreno 618 graphics, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage expandable via an SD card slot.

Getting back to the endurance claims, this TCL laptop is rated for 10 to 12 hours of battery life and charges through a USB-C connection. Additional ports include a second USB Type-A, a USB 3.0 Type-A port, and a headphone jack.

The TCL Book 14 Go will cost $349 when it arrives ""in select regions"" in Q2 2022.

At CES 2021, TCL revealed the NXTPAPER, an 8.88-inch tablet with a paper-like color E Ink display that could handle video. The announcement was met with cautious excitement from those hoping to read comics or textbooks in full color, but the tablet never made it stateside.

This year, TCL is giving it a second shot with the NXTPAPER 10s, which the company says was made ""specifically with a focus on eye protection."" It reduces blue light, a particularly harmful section of visible light that can purportedly increase eye strain and raise your risk of macular degradation.

Running Android 11, the NXTPAPER 10s has a 10.1-inch, 1920 x 1200 color paper-like touchscreen display. It runs on a Mediatek MT8768E chip with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage expandable to 256GB, and has a 5,500 mAh battery. The tablet ships with a passive pen but also supports a type case, flip case, and a writing pad.

It looks like folks in the U.S. will miss out once again, though; TCL says the NXTPAPER 10 will cost $249 when it first arrives in China and Europe later this month.

Also launching at CES this year is a pair of budget tablets called the Tab 8 4G and Tab 10L and a trio of TKEE slates made for children.

The two tab models come in 8-inch and 10.1-inch versions and are powered by an entry-level quad-core Mediatek chips SoCs with 2GB or 3GB of RAM. They run Android 11, come with rear and front-facing cameras, and can expand their storage to 256GB.

The Tab 8 4G will cost $129 when it arrives in Europe in the next few months while the Tab 10L goes for $99 and will be sold in select markets.

Made for kids, the three TKEE tablets come in Max, Mid, and Mini versions with the main difference being the size: 10, 7, or 8 inches. These also run Android 11 and earn points for having an adorable yet sturdy yellow bumper case.

The TKEE series costs $89 for the mini, $148 for the mid, and $119 for the Max. All of these go on sale in select regions in the next few months.","{'uri': 'gizmodo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gizmodo'}",[],"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/761199ec405ed2b4c6a77bd0ee0cd1de.jpg",0.192156862745098,eng-7382870,False,0.5764706134796143,0.192156862745098,379001040,1

Realme GT 2 series was launched in China on Tuesday, January 4, 2022. The series spawns two models, the vanilla Realme GT 2 and more powerful Realme GT 2 Pro. Both phones are virtually the same deal as far as design, software, RAM, cameras, and battery capacity are concerned. The pro GT 2 gets you a better screen and a faster chip.

The GT 2 series marks the starting point for Realme's journey into the high-end global market.

The brand says it is using more premium -- and seemingly sustainable -- build materials here that should add to overall cost. Two of the GT 2 Pro and GT 2 variants, called paper green and paper white feature the artwork of Muji's iconic designer, Naoto Fukasawa, and are made using a bio-polymer material by SABIC. The phones will also come in more regular titanium blue and steel black colourways.

The box, that the phones will ship inside, are said to minimise use of plastic from 21.7% down to 0.3%.

Realme GT 2, Realme GT 2 Pro spec-check

The Realme GT 2 Pro comes with a 6.7-inch Samsung-made LTPO AMOLED display with a 1440p or 2k resolution and hole punch cut-out. It can peak 1,400nits. There is Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection as well.

Yes, we are talking about realme and the phone we are referring to is the realme GT 2 Pro, which has the task of competing in 2022 with all the high-end smartphones of the competition.

The work is not going to be easy but the truth is that it really has started on the right foot, since it has made sure to start the year presenting the first phone with the new Qualcomm. Without further delay Let's go with the technical characteristics of the realme GT 2 Pro:

ENTYTABLE:

Despite how much we still have to know, since Realme has only given brushstrokes of this top-of-the-range phone from 2022, there are several aspects that we can already highlight.

To begin with, we cannot stop looking at the chosen processor, since This is the best Qualcomm chip made to date: the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.

As we explained a few weeks ago, this SoC is going to be incorporated into the high-end this year due to the great technological leap involved. the new 4nm architecture and the world's first ARM v9 configuration.

We were already at the launch of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and we are well aware of the performance improvements and the latent power in this chip.

After the chip, the AMOLED screen with 2K resolution is the other great asset, especially for its LTPO 2.0 technology and 525 dpi resolution (pixels per inch), which will give it a very high sharpness. It is also compatible with the adaptive refresh rate of 120 Hz that ensures good energy efficiency.

The realme GT 2 Pro features the most powerful cooling system on the market, say its creators, being able to cool the phone up to 3 degrees Celsius to increase the performance of the chip.

This system has a 9-layer structure and includes stainless steel Vapor Cooling technology. There will be what performance this solution really has.

In the photographic section, realme GT 2 Pro includes a triple camera setup where the main 50 Mpx uses the IMX766 sensor, present in many high-end devices with features such as omnidirectional PDAF and OIS.

In addition to this We have a 150-degree wide angle that can perform high-quality panoramas, thanks to the 50-megapixel Samsung JN1 sensor Combined with 150 degree ultra-wide mode and the world's first fisheye mode.

And, finally, it has a Macro of 40x, but of which we do not know megapixels or diaphragm.

Realme GT 2 Pro has finally arrived, marking the official entry of the young smartphone brand into the ultra premium segment. Realme has been working on the GT 2 Pro for a long time, and that is why the phone comes with a thoughtfully curated set of specifications. There is an AMOLED display with adaptive refresh rate, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, the flagship 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 camera, and fast charging.

At the China-exclusive event, Realme also announced the launch of the GT 2, which is the vanilla version in the series. The GT 2 is suitable for people who do not want the best-in-class features but are willing to settle for lesser specifications. Not much is different in terms of the specifications of the Realme GT 2 from GT 2 Pro, but good enough for the significant price gap between the two models.

Realme GT 2 Pro, GT 2 price

The Realme GT 2 Pro costs CNY 3,899 (roughly Rs 45,800) for the 8GB, 128GB variant, CNY 4,199 (roughly Rs 49,340) for the 8GB, 256GB variant, CNY 4,499 (roughly Rs 52,850) for the 12GB, 256GB model, and CNY 4,999 (roughly Rs 58,800) for the 12GB, 512GB model.

The Realme GT 2, on the other hand, is priced at CNY 2,599 (roughly Rs 30,530) for the 8GB, 128GB version, CNY 2,799 (roughly Rs 32,880) for the 8GB, 256GB version, and CNY 3,099 (roughly Rs 36,400) for the 12GB, 256GB version.

Realme GT 2 Pro, GT 2 specifications

The Realme GT 2 Pro is a flagship and its specifications justify that label. The smartphone has a 6.7-inch Samsung OLED display with a resolution of 3216x1440 pixels. This display uses an LTPO panel, which is also there on the high-end iPhone 13 Pro models. It allows the display to dynamically adjust the refresh rate depending on the content. The display is protected by the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus and supports a peak brightness of 1400 nits.

Powering the GT 2 Pro is an octa-core Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, which Qualcomm unveiled in December last year. This is the fastest processor for an Android phone right now and will power all the flagship phones of 2022. The cooling area inside the phone is constructed with an all-new 9-layer cooling structure with a 4129mm² Stainless Steel VC area.

The phone uses Android 12-based Realme UI 3.0. The three cameras on the Realme GT 2 Pro uses a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor with optical image stabilisation, a second 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a field of view of 150-degrees, and a 3-megapixel microscope camera with 40X magnification. For selfies, the phone has a 32-megapixel camera inside the punch-hole.

Inside the Realme GT 2 Pro is a 5000mAh battery but it retains the 65W fast charging that Realme has been using on its phones for almost two years now. Realme unveiled the 125W charging in 2020 but it has not debuted on a phone yet.

The Realme GT 2 has little toned-down specifications comparatively. It has a 6.62-inch AMOLED display with Full-HD+ resolution. It has a refresh rate of up to 120Hz and a peak brightness of 1300 nits. Powering the phone is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset and it runs Android 12-based Realme UI 3.0. The rest of the specifications of the GT 2 Pro are the same as the Pro variant.","{'uri': 'indiatoday.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'India Today'}","[{'uri': 'shubham_verma@indiatoday.in', 'name': 'Shubham Verma', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202201/realmegt2pro_4012022-647x363.png?hwPZc6STz2vdc2gSFzfZYSX0mh3qOwZg,0.5058823529411764,eng-7378497,False,0.7215686440467834,0.5058823529411764,378999120,2

The Realme GT 2 Pro will be available in four colour variants, including a Paper White, Paper Green, Steel Black and Titanium Blue

Realme GT 2

The Realme GT 2 features a 6.62-inch FHD+ AMOLED display that supports 120Hz refresh rate. The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 888 and comes with up to 12GB RAM and 256GB storage.

Coming to the cameras the Realme GT 2 features a triple camera setup with a 50MP Sony IMX766 primary sensor with OIS. There is also an 8MP Ultra-wide sensor and a 2MP depth sensor.

The Realme GT 2 is also available in the same four colour variants - Paper White, Paper Green, Steel Black and Titanium Blue.

Both Realme GT 2 series phones feature the new paper-like design on the textured back. The devices also come with a 5,000mAh battery and 65W SuperDart charging support. The company also spoke about more eco-friendly packaging with the Realme GT 2 series.

Pricing

The Realme GT 2 is priced starting at RMB 2599 (about Rs 30,541) while the Realme GT 2 Pro starts at RMB 3699 (about Rs 43,467). Both smartphones are expected to launch in India in the near future.","{'uri': 'indianexpress.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}",[],https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/01/Realme-GT-2-series-feature-image.jpg,0.4352941176470588,eng-7378497,False,0.8235294222831726,0.4352941176470588,378998220,1

Realme is a rapidly-growing brand, so we were expecting exciting things for its GT 2 series, especially after the fantastic mid-range original Realme GT in 2021 ended up being one of the best Android phones of the year.

We're still waiting to hear when the Realme GT 2 series will launch globally (which is also when we'll hear about pricing), but judging by the specs and features, which we'll share below, we're excited to test this mobile out.

Let's start with the Pro model, as that's the top-spec of the two.

The Realme GT 2 Pro has a 6.7-inch 120Hz screen with a 2K resolution - unlike most high-res screens on the market, this one doesn't curve at the edges, so it'll be a top choice for people who like their flat-edge displays.

The phone is made from 'bio-polymer' material, which apparently is inspired by paper. Beyond that, it's still a fairly standard-looking mobile and it comes in white, green, black or blue,

We already knew that the Realme GT 2 Pro would use the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, which is the most powerful processor from Qualcomm, paired with either 8GB or 12GB RAM and 128GB, 256GB or 512GB storage.

The camera department is what excites us most about the Realme GT 2 Pro. Joining the 50MP main camera is another 50MP ultra-wide camera using a 150-degree lens - this is one of the widest fields of view we've seen on a smartphone camera - and also a microscope camera that magnifies objects up to 40x. We imagine this works similarly to the microscope camera on the Oppo Find X3 Pro, which zoomed in 30x, and was super fun to play around with to take super-close-up pictures.

Rounding out the party is a 5,000mAh battery and 65W wired charging - it doesn't sound like there's wireless powering here, though.

In most regards, the Realme GT 2 is the same as the 2 Pro, but a few differences have been detailed.

The main one is the chipset - the Realme GT 2 will use the Snapdragon 888, the predecessor to the 8 Gen 1, and the same processor the original Realme GT used.

The Realme GT 2's screen will also have a slightly downgraded screen in terms of color profile, though honestly, we don't imagine many people will notice the changes.

It's possible that there are more ways the Realme GT 2 differs from the Pro than we've mentioned - the standard phone was only mentioned in one paragraph of the press release TechRadar received, compared to several pages about the Pro - but we're waiting on a global launch, and to test the phones, to be sure.","{'uri': 'techradar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechRadar'}","[{'uri': 'tom_bedford@techradar.com', 'name': 'Tom Bedford', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UmTUm6B7wRB9CTyDeDMmi-1200-80.jpg,0.5215686274509803,eng-7378497,False,0.7568627595901489,0.5215686274509803,378998100,1

Unfortunately, as 2022 begins, Microsoft has not delivered the update.

According to Windows Central, the tech giant may skip the standard Android 12 release and go for Android 12L on the Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2.

Google recently announced a preview of Android 12L, which may sound like a new version of Android, but Google calls it ""a special feature drop that makes Android 12 even better on large screens"".

The idea here is to provide users on tablets, foldables and Chrome OS laptops -- anything with a screen above 600 dp -- with an improved user interface.

Coming back to Microsoft Surface Duo, it features two 5.6-inch OLED (1,350x1,800 pixels) displays with 4:3 aspect ratio that join together to provide an 8.1-inch PixelSense Fusion display with 2,700 x 1,800 pixels resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio.

Under the hood, the Surface Duo has an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC, paired with 6GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. There are also two batteries, with an overall capacity of 3,577mAh.","{'uri': 'timesnownews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TimesNow'}",[],https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/Duo.jpg,0.1450980392156862,,True,0,0.1450980392156862,378997800,1

First, there are two new true wireless earbuds, the $179 Monster DNA Fit and $149 Monster DNA Pro, plus two new Bluetooth speakers, the $179 Monster DNA One and $199 Monster DNA Max. All four products will be available at Walmart in the coming weeks and months.

But even though these products bear the Monster brand and the DNA label that Monster has used for its headphones in the past, technically speaking, they aren't made by Monster. Instead, Monster has licensed its brand to Lifeworks Technology Group. Lifeworks also maintains a separate website for its Monster-branded products. Still, Lifeworks assures Digital Trends that these new DNA products were created with the full involvement of the product team at Monster, and that they meet the company's standards for Monster products.

Monster DNA Fit, $179, available January 7

The DNA Fit are clearly aimed at folks who want a fully secure set of earbuds for working out -- and at $179, they're priced to undercut the similarly designed $249 Powerbeats Pro. They've got active noise cancellation (ANC) and offer IPX5 water resistance, which will easily withstand rain, sweat, and even a rinse under running water -- two characteristics that the Powerbeats Pro lack.

They come in a fabric-wrapped, Qi-compatible wirelessly charging case, and have a very impressive nine hours of playing time per charge and a total of 24 hours when you include the case's capacity. The earbuds come with a huge assortment of 12 sizes of silicone eartips, which should help most people get a secure and comfy fit.

The DNA Fit are also some of the first true wireless earbuds we've seen to ship with support for Qualcomm's new aptX Lossless Bluetooth codec -- a feature that requires a phone or other source device that also works with the lossless codec.

Monster DNA Pro, $149, available February 1

Monster isn't doing itself many favors by naming a new set of true wireless earbuds with the same name as a previous set of its wireless headphones it sold in 2013, but that's apparently not stopping it from moving forward with the DNA Pro name.

If the Monster DNA Fit are Monster's answer to the Powerbeats Pro, then the DNA Pro is the company's response to Apple's AirPods Pro. They're an ANC set of wireless earbuds with six hours of battery life (30 in total with the charging case), and they have an IPX5 rating for water resistance. Monster hasn't released much more in the way of details, but we do know that the DNA Pro support wireless charging.

Monster DNA One, $179, available March 1

The Monster DNA One is a go-anywhere Bluetooth speaker with a 13-hour battery life and IP67 dust and water resistance, making it an ideal companion for both poolside and the beach.

It can charge wirelessly, as well as via its USB-C port, and has 12 watts of total power, which is considerable given its small size. Monster says it also has a feature called Monster Share, which lets you wirelessly pair the DNA One with up to 99 other speakers and up to two source devices, with no mobile app needed.

Monster DNA Max, $199, available March 1

The Monster DNA Max looks like Monster's take on the rugged home portable speaker made popular by the Ultimate Ears Blast/Boom speakers. Like the DNA One, it combines a rugged IP67 rating with up to 20 hours of playing time. But the Max is slightly more powerful, with 26 watts of total power. It also delivers its audio in a 360-degree pattern.

The Max can recharge wirelessly and Monster includes a Qi-compatible charging mat, an 18-watt USB-C wall charger, and a braided six-foot USB-C cable for when you want to power up quickly. The USB-C port can be used to power up your other devices when the speaker isn't using that port for its own charging needs. The Max also works with Monster Share so you can sync up a bunch of speakers at once.

The phone has been teased several times already and many of the specs leaked, but this is the first time Realme has given us all the details, and there are a few surprises.

The 150-degree, 50-megapixel wide-angle camera is a world-first on a phone, and we can't wait to try it out. The field of view is far wider than most wide-angle cameras fitted to phones, and Realme says it will produce images showing, ""extreme panoramas."" It's joined by a Micro-lens Camera, which will take close-up shots at 40x magnification. We've seen something like this before on the Oppo Find X3 Pro and had fun with the unusual feature, and while Realme is closely related to Oppo, it's a surprise to see it here.

We already knew the Realme GT 2 Pro would use Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, making it one of the first to do so, and it will come in a choice of three different versions: an 8GB/128GB model, a 12GB/256GB model, or the top 12GB.512GB version. On the front is an AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and a 2K resolution, plus the ability to display more than a billion colors. It has HRD10+ certification and is covered in Gorilla Glass Victus. This is also reminiscent of the Oppo Find X3 Pro's screen.

What else? It has a 5,000mAh battery with Realme's 65W SuperDart fast charging, stereo speakers with Dolby Atoms, Android 12 with the Realme UI 3.0 interface, plus an extensive cooling system to make sure the Snapdragon processor operates at peak efficiency. The phone's body comes in four colors -- white, green, blue, or black -- and has been designed by long-time Realme partner Naoto Fukasawa, a Japanese industrial designer.

The GT 2 series also includes a standard Realme GT 2, which has the same design and screen as the Pro version, but replaces the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor. The Realme GT 2 Pro will launch in China first and come to Europe soon, but no final release date or price has been stated yet.

The computer, known as a domain controller in the automotive industry, will be specifically engineered for TuSimple's commercial self-driving trucks, and will power sensor perception and vehicle operation.

Nvidia will provide artificial intelligence expertise and its Drive Orin hardware, a chip specifically designed for autonomous driving capabilities.

The controller powered by Nvidia's chip will be installed in the autonomous trucks TuSimple is currently developing https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/dhl-orders-100-self-driving-us-trucks-tusimple-navistar-2021-12-16 in partnership with manufacturer Navistar, targeted for production in 2024.

""We believe this move provides us a significant competitive advantage in speeding time to market,"" TuSimple Chief Executive Officer Cheng Lu said in a statement.

TuSimple said it will own usage rights to the controller's design, adding that it planned to work with an unnamed third party manufacturer to produce it.

Considered crucial in the development of self-driving, controllers allow automakers to centralize compute-intensive instruments such as cameras, radars and lidar sensors.

Instead of each sensor being equipped with an individual electronic control unit, the domain controller handles computing tasks centrally, saving cost and space and allowing software updates to take place remotely.

Other chipmakers, including Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp's Mobileye and NXP are also offering domain controller chips for the automotive industry.

It is of no moment that the suit wasn't against Intel, as Intel 'need not face a specific threat of infringement.'"" - Circuit Judge Sharon Prost

On December 28, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) issued a pair of precedential decisions in appeals raised by chipmaker Intel. These appeals came from final written decisions in several inter partes review (IPR) proceedings challenging the validity of patent claims owned by rival firm Qualcomm. In both decisions, the Federal Circuit found that Intel satisfied Article III standing requirements for appealing from the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).

Standing has become a thorny issue that has plagued the Federal Circuit and PTAB. There is no standing requirement to bring an IPR challenge, but the fact that one without an injury-in-fact may bring an administrative challenge against a patent before the PTAB at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) does not change the need for constitutional standing for an appeal to be taken from the administrative tribunal to an Article III court, such as the Federal Circuit. That, at least until last week, was the state of the law. Confirmed repeatedly by the Federal Circuit, in cases such as JTEKT, and even in allowing the Electronic Frontier Foundation to participate to remain in an appeal despite no injury-in-fact because there was another appellant who did satisfied the constitutional standing requirement. For an appeal to be appropriate there must be constitutional standing.

Now, the rule requiring constitutional standing for an IPR appeal to be entertained by the Federal Circuit has shifted. Intel was found to have standing despite there being no specific threat of infringement.

The Article III standing issue is given longer treatment in case 20-1664, an appeal of a single IPR proceeding challenging Qualcomm's patent covering a stepped gain mixer for use in radio frequency communication systems. Although the PTAB determined that Intel had prevailed in demonstrating the obviousness of claims 1 through 3 and 7 of U.S. Patent No. 8229043, several claims were held as nonobvious over the prior art and the PTAB granted Qualcomm's motion to amend claims 2, 3 and 7. Qualcomm had moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of standing as the '043 patent was not asserted against Intel but rather against Apple, a real-party-in-interest (RPI) during the underlying IPR proceeding but not a party to Intel's appeal.

Reciting the standard from the U.S. Supreme Court's 2016 decision in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, the Federal Circuit acknowledged that, to satisfy Article III standing, a party bringing suit must demonstrate (1) an ""injury in fact"" that must be concrete and particularized, which is (2) ""fairly traceable"" to the defendant's challenged conduct and (3) ""likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision."" Applying this standard to the context of IPRs, which under 35 U.S.C. § 311 can be generally petitioned by anyone other than the patent owner, the Federal Circuit noted that the first element of the Spokeo standard is satisfied by an IPR petitioner who has engaged in, is engaging in or will likely engage in activity giving rise to an infringement claim.

""Although Qualcomm didn't sue Intel for infringement, Qualcomm has not disputed that it mapped the '043 patent claims to an Intel product (and only an Intel product) in a prior suit against Apple... It is of no moment that the suit wasn't against Intel, as Intel 'need not face a specific threat of infringement.'""

The Federal Circuit found Intel's appeal analogous to the facts at issue in the appellate court's 2020 decision in Grit Energy Solutions, LLC v. Oren Technologies. In Grit Energy, the Federal Circuit found Article III standing because the appellant had previously been sued on patent claims challenged in the appealed IPR proceedings and the previously infringement suit had been dismissed without prejudice, giving Oren the possibility of reasserting those patent claims against Grit Energy in the future. The court found Article III standing over Oren's arguments that it had no pending cases against Grit Energy and that Grit Energy had transferred away ownership of the products giving rise to the previous infringement suit without identifying any future business plans that could have created an infringement claim.

The Federal Circuit gives shorter shrift to the Article III issue in case 20-1828, but the succinct statement made in that opinion offers a concise explanation of the court's reasoning on that point:

""Intel has engaged in activity that has already given rise to an infringement suit by Qualcomm. And Qualcomm has not disputed that, in those proceedings, it identified an Intel product as the 'secondary processor' of the '949 patent. Thus, for the same reasons as in our companion case, 'Intel's risks transcend mere conjecture or hypothesis.' That is so even though Intel has only shown that it manufactures the claimed 'secondary processor' of the '949 patent's claimed inventions, not all the components required by the claims, given the centrality of that component to the claims, the possibility of direct infringement suits based on product testing, and the possibility of indirect infringement suits based on at least inducement. We therefore find that Intel has standing and proceed to consider the merits of its appeal."" (citations removed)

Of course, citing Grit for a proposition that is clearly erroneous to support another decision that will be (and is) clearly erroneous is par for the course at the Federal Circuit. Standing be damned, the Federal Circuit wanted to allow Intel to appeal because Qualcomm didn't lose all the claims challenged at the PTAB!

Furthermore, the Federal Circuit obviously is unfamiliar with Qualcomm's business model (which is astonishing). Qualcomm licenses its portfolio. So, as long as Intel would reasonably engage in licensing negotiations in a fair and reasonable manner there would be no reason for them to anticipate Qualcomm would resort to the judicial process. Qualcomm does not sue first and ask questions later, that is not their model. Of course, with those that are recalcitrant and who engage in predatory infringement, they do find it necessary to sue from time to time to enforce their rights. But a crystal ball is not one of the essential tools for a judge or court when determining the existence of constitutional standing, so the Federal Circuit decision to allow Intel to appeal is clearly erroneous.

There is a wrinkle in all of this, since at the end of the day any fight between Qualcomm and Intel is a proxy war between Qualcomm and Apple.

In ruling that Intel had Article III standing to pursue its IPR appeals, the Federal Circuit noted that Intel is not a party to the licensing agreement between Apple and Qualcomm that settled the infringement claims between those parties as to the patents-at-issue. Twice this past year, the Federal Circuit had ruled that Apple's licensing agreement with Qualcomm extinguished Article III standing for Apple to pursue its own appeals of IPR proceedings challenging the validity of Qualcomm's patents. On November 17, Apple filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court asking the Court to find that a licensee entering an agreement to license multiple patents has Article III standing to challenge the validity of patents covered by that agreement. We await a decision from the Supreme Court on whether they will take the case.

In the second Federal Circuit decision dismissing Apple's appeal for lack of Article III standing, Circuit Judge Pauline Newman penned a lengthy dissent which indicates that Apple's petition for cert could pique some interest at the Supreme Court. Judge Newman argued that the AIA did not extinguish the Supreme Court's ruling in Lear v. Adkins (1969), which overturned the doctrine of licensee estoppel, nor did it condition the appealability of PTAB decisions based on licensee status. Cases cited in the majority opinion to support the court's dismissal of Apple's appeal on Article III grounds, including Consumer Watchdog v. Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (2014), involved public interest entities that didn't have the same potential for infringement liability, as Apple's license agreement with Qualcomm will expire before the patent claims reach their expiration date. Judge Newman found that the AIA's estoppel provisions alone provide Apple with Article III standing as they prevent Apple from pursuing invalidity grounds raised at the PTAB in district court litigation.

While there are other areas of patent law where Supreme Court review would be much more helpful, including the Section 101 issues on which the Court continues to pass, one could see SCOTUS fielding this question simply because it's easier to grasp than judicial exceptions to patent eligibility. The Federal Circuit's decision to find Article III standing for Intel, which hadn't been sued on the challenged Qualcomm patent claims, makes the CAFC's own rulings on the subject seem inconsistent.","{'uri': 'ipwatchdog.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law'}",[],https://www.ipwatchdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Depositphotos_42165711_XL-scaled.jpg,0.08235294117647052,,False,0,0.08235294117647052,378997260,14

This isn't making it any easier to pick a phone, Samsung.

Aside from the slightly larger screen of 6.4in on the S21 FE over the 6.2in on the S21, the S21 FE shares many of its specs with the S21. The slightly smaller screen uses the same 1080p 120Hz OLED panel as the S21 and the design of the newer device is largely unchanged except for the plastic camera bump instead of metal.

The S21 FE also shares the same 5nm chipset as the S21, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 in the US or Samsung's Exynos 2100 for the rest of the world. The main camera sensor was also carried over to the new device along with fast 25W charging, 15W wireless charging, the IP68 water and dust resistance rating and full 5G capabilities.

So what's the difference? Well, the 4,500mAh battery of the S21 FE comes from the S21's bigger brother, the S21+. Other than that, specs have been cut back to reach that lower price point.

The S21 FE uses an 8MP telephoto lens instead of the 64MP lens in the S21. The S21 also comes standard with two more gigabytes of RAM. Don't expect all the same software bells and whistles in the FE either. Although it does ship with Android 12 and One UI 4.0.

With the S21 FE, Samsung is surely looking to repeat the success it saw with the S20 FE launch. But in the time since, it's released the A52s 5G and dropped the price of the base S21 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, making it slightly harder to find the right mix of features at a comfortable price point. Then there's the whole S22 launch that's around the corner.","{'uri': 'stuff.co.za', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Stuff'}","[{'uri': 'duncan_pike@stuff.co.za', 'name': 'Duncan Pike', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://stuff.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S21-FE.png,0.1450980392156862,eng-7377109,False,0.729411780834198,0.1450980392156862,378997020,1

However, the company did not provide all the details yet, just showed the design in advance. The OnePlus 10 Pro 5G is getting, as has now been confirmed, a newly designed camera module on the back, which is certainly a matter of taste. On the one hand, OnePlus leads the lines of the frame into the cover around the camera module and was obviously heavily inspired by Samsung's design of the S21 and probably soon the S22 series.

On the other hand, the three main cameras are placed extremely prominently on the back and complemented by a ring-shaped flash with four LEDs. It is still unclear which specific configuration will be used here, although the Swedish camera specialist Hasselblad will generally optimize it.

Earlier it was announced that OnePlus is integrating a 48-megapixel sensor for the main camera, while a 50-MP sensor for ultra-wide-angle shots and an 8-megapixel telephoto zoom camera will also be installed. There is also the usual combination of a high-quality metal frame and colored back. Allegedly, ceramic is used here instead of glass, so it remains to be seen how resistant the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G will be.

Inside the new top smartphone from the Oppo subsidiary, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen1 does its job, which should set new standards in terms of performance in Android devices. It is still open whether OnePlus will manage to keep its alleged heat problems under control. The top SoC is combined with 12 gigabytes of RAM and 256 GB of internal flash memory. On the front, there is a probably 6.7-inch AMOLED display with QHD + resolution and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120 Hertz. The official market launch of the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G will start on January 11th, initially only serving China.

OnePlus will not make the new device available in other countries until a later date in February or March. Incidentally, there should initially only be two color variants in ""Volcano Black"" (black) and ""Emerald Forest"" (green).

Here is a summary of all the highlights from Monday in CES2022.

Samsung Galaxy S21FE

Samsung's first big smartphone in 2022 is not the Galaxy S22, but the Galaxy S21 FE (FE stands for Fan Edition). The significantly delayed Galaxy S21 FE is basically a simplified version of its flagship product, the Galaxy S21, with some trade-offs. The ""affordable"" flagship features a 6.4-inch 120Hz display, a Snapdragon 888 chipset, and a 128GB-based model at a low price of $ 699. Phones will be available in some countries next week. Galaxy S21FE has joined Samsung's crowded smartphone lineup. The question is, who is the target audience for the Galaxy S21 FE? The S21 FE is between the regular Galaxy S21 and Galaxy A52.

OnePlus 9 Pro has passed. Enter the OnePlus 10 Pro. OnePlus will use the week of CES 2022 to announce its first mega flagship of the year. The phone has no price or specs, but the company shared a photo of the device. That's exactly what the rumors suggest. High-end smartphones are rumored to have a 6.7-inch QHD Plus display with a refresh rate of 120Hz, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 CPU, 12GB of RAM, 5G network support, and a 5,000mAh battery. increase. As for the camera, the phone will be equipped with a 48-megapixel primary shooter that supports a 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens. OnePlus 10 Pro runs on a new integrated operating system that combines Android-based Oxygen OS with Oppo's Color OS. OnePlus will launch its latest flagship in China on January 11th.

LOral has become the annual name at CES, and 2022 is no exception. This time around, I'm going to introduce Color Sonic, a device similar to a straightener, but in reality, it's aimed at allowing you to apply hair color evenly, without the confusion that the process usually involves. Colorsonic provides consistent hair coloring results, claims the company, and the device will be officially released in 2023.

With Colorsonic, users can choose from over 40 shades and the device is ready for hair coloring applications at the push of a button. There are hairbrush-like hairs on the top that convey the color. Also, use a color cartridge to mix and create hair colors. Based on the video shared by L'Oreal, applying hair color is as easy as combing hair. Simply wash your hair after the process and the new color will show through.

I don't know how much this device will cost when it actually hits the market, but if it really works smoothly like the demo video, it could change the way you color your hair at home.

Jabra Elite 4 Active

Jabra used the CES 2022 to announce the $ 119 Elite 4 Active, a set of waterproof Active Noise Canceling (ANC) earphones. It provides a safe and comfortable fit without the need for hooks or wing tips. The earphones support IP57 rating, transparent mode that can capture the outside world, and both AAC and aptX Bluetooth codecs. Jabra claims that it takes 7 hours per charge on the earphones, for a total of 28 hours including the charging case. They are already available in some markets for navy, black and light mint.

Reports that followed said Samsung might cancel the S21 FE due to the components shortage and logistics issues that impacted manufacturing last year. As we got closer to 2022, rumors said the Galaxy S21 FE will get a very late launch. Some pointed to January 4th as the potential launch date, and Samsung has just delivered it. The problem with the Galaxy S21 FE right now is that it's coming out too close to the Galaxy S22 series, which is due next month.

Unveiled at CES 2022, the Galaxy S21 FE is supposed to be the more affordable Galaxy S21 version that some buyers might be waiting for. But the regular Galaxy S21 is already a great deal at $799. That's the phone's original price, from about a year ago. You can easily find much better price discounts for the Galaxy S21 right now.

Put differently, the Galaxy S21 FE is practically a 2021 phone launching in 2022 for $699.

It's very likely the cheaper Galaxy S22 option will cost around $799. Samsung faces immense pressure from the iPhone 13, which has the same price as the iPhone 12. Not to mention the Pixel 6, which offers tremendous value for an even lower price.

That's to say the Galaxy S22 might be a much better deal than the Galaxy S21 FE at this point in the game. If you've waited this long for a cheap flagship, you might wait one more month before you decide. New Galaxy S phone preorders do come with all sorts of perks, after all.

Separately, the $499 Galaxy A52 might be a better mid-range option if you're looking to save more money on your next Samsung Galaxy phone. The Galaxy S20 FE might also be a better choice than the Galaxy S21 FE when it comes to savings.

Finally, you should know that the $699 Galaxy S21 FE only features 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. You'll have to pay $769 for 8GB of RAM and double the storage.

Samsung will start selling the Galaxy S21 FE on January 11th, or the release date that we've been expecting all along.

All of that doesn't mean the Galaxy S21 will disappoint. We're looking at a variation of the Galaxy S21 here, which means you're getting the same overall build quality and high-end performance.

Yes, the Galaxy S21 FE is made of plastic, just like the Galaxy S21. But both phones run on the Snapdragon 888 processor, Qualcomm's 2021 flagship chip. They also ship with high-resolution displays that support 120Hz refresh rates.

The Galaxy S21 FE actually has a slightly bigger screen, at 6.4-inch vs. 6.2-inch for the Galaxy S21. That gives the new FE a larger footprint, so you're getting a slightly larger battery pack. The 4,500 mAh battery supports 25W charging speeds -- you'll reach more than 50% capacity in just 30 minutes.

The Galaxy S21 FE rocks the same signature design as the Galaxy S21. You get three cameras encased in a metal enclosure. We're looking at 12-megapixel wide camera with OIS, 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera with 30x Space Zoom lens. A 32-megapixel front camera pierces through the screen.

Like the Galaxy S21, the FE supports 5G connectivity (sub-6GHz and mmWave), an in-display fingerprint sensor, and IP68 dust and water-resistance certification.

The Galaxy S22 series should be unveiled in mid-February and hit stores by the end of the month.","{'uri': 'bgr.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'BGR'}","[{'uri': 'chris_smith@bgr.com', 'name': 'Chris Smith', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/galaxy-s21-fe-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all,0.1372549019607843,eng-7377109,False,0.9254902005195618,0.1372549019607843,378995640,1

A number of large exhibitors have canceled their plans to attend CES in person, but according to the organizers, there's still plenty happening at consumer tech's big shindig. We are covering the show remotely here at WIRED, and we'll share every fascinating tidbit here in our liveblog, which will run for the next few days. New entries will appear at the top of the feed below.

Tuesday is the ""press preview"" day at CES. There are lots of press conferences and big announcements coming over the course of the day, so stay tuned. Especially look for coverage of electric vehicles -- many of the big automakers are holding media events in Las Vegas today, so expect to see some wild concept vehicles on display, along with more practical behind-the-wheel enhancements everyone can benefit from.

The Galaxy S21 is so last year, but it's not time for the Galaxy S22 just yet. As Samsung's top-end flagship smartphone starts to disappear from store shelves (supplies have been scarce for several months), the Galaxy S21 Fan Edition (FE) is taking its place. This glass slab has the same speedy Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, AMOLED 120-Hz screen, and 12-megapixel main camera, and it starts at $699, a price that's $100 cheaper that its elder sibling.

There are a few differences. It's 0.2 inches thicker than last year's 6.2-inch Galaxy S21. I've used it for the past few days, and it still feels pretty compact and remarkably thin. This bigger size allows for a beefier 4,500-mAh battery too. But what brings down the price is the plasticky shell. (It still has a metal frame inside.) Samsung also swapped the 64-megapixel telephoto zoom camera for an 8-megapixel one. Details from this camera sensor won't be as sharp, but the upgraded 32-megapixel selfie cam on the front might make up for it.

The S21 FE is Samsung's first phone to run Android 12 out of the box. It comes in four colors: white, olive, graphite, and lavender. The conundrum? Samsung is expected to reveal the Galaxy S22 next month, and if it follows the pattern set by its predecessors, it'll cost just $100 more than the S21 FE. You may want to wait. -- Julian Chokkattu

Samsung's glastic ""cheap flagship"" arrived with a bang, sporting a Qualcomm 888 chipset, 6/8GB of RAM and 128/256GB of storage.

This model follows the philosophy of its predecessor - bridging the gap between upper midrangers and flagship phones. The new S21 FE is one of the cheapest ways for people to hop on the 120Hz refresh rate wagon too. If you want all the details, check out our dedicated Galaxy S21 FE piece, but meanwhile - we're here to talk about deals.

The official announcement might be behind our backs already but the phone enters the availability phase on January 11th. Which means you can't get it at the moment. What you can do is sign up for a reminder on Samsung's official site, in order not to miss a second when the phone arrives available for purchase.

The price of the Galaxy S21 FE is pretty much the same as the one we got when the original Galaxy S20 FE launched. You will be able to get the phone for $699 for the 6GB RAM/128GB storage version, while $769 will get you a Galaxy S21 FE with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.

That's hard to say. Normally, when a new model gets released, its price is almost always set in stone. You'll have to wait a few months for big promos and deals to start popping up. However, this isn't always the case - there are rare occasions when the manufacturer wants to push its new phone right away and starts offering deals and discounts from day 1.

Your best bet is Samsung's official site. Even though the Korean giant probably won't discount the phone right away, there will be trade-in deals for sure. Samsung is notorious for its trade-in incentives, and there's no reason for the company not to offer some great Galaxy S21 FE trade-in deals.

The most plausible scenario is that Samsung may include a trade-in deal for the previous model - the Galaxy S20 FE. People that own the predecessor and are happy with the model philosophy and execution might want to upgrade to the next model. So watch out for these Galaxy S21 FE trade-in deals.","{'uri': 'phonearena.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Phone Arena'}","[{'uri': 'mariyan_slavov@phonearena.com', 'name': 'Mariyan Slavov', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://m-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/137546-wide-two_940/The-best-Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-deals-what-to-expect,0.1294117647058823,eng-7377109,False,0.7568627595901489,0.1294117647058823,378994740,1

Other chipmakers, including Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp's Mobileye and NXP are also offering domain controller chips for the automotive industry.

Self-driving freight trucks, while still operating largely in pilot projects, have become a focus of the autonomous industry in recent years, facing fewer regulatory and technological hurdles and potentially offering a faster way to generate returns than passenger robotaxis.

Moto G51 is Motorola's latest offering in the mid-range category. The sub-15000 segment is brimming with options, but the Moto G51 comes with many firsts. The Moto G51 comes with 5G support, and it is the first smartphone ever in India to come with a Snapdragon 480+ chipset. Along with an all-new chipset, it comes with a 120Hz FHD+ display, a 50MP triple camera setup and a good battery and all that without digging a hole in the packet.

With no 5G in sight, the Indian smartphone market is filled with phones that are ""future-ready"", meaning they come with 5G support. The Moto G51 is the second phone in the mid-range category to offer 5G after the company had launched the Moto G 5G. So, do you think you should place your bet on the Moto G51? Let us find that out in the review.

Moto G51 review: Design

Motorola's mid-range devices are rarely flashy and swanky. The design language is pretty much the same in all the sub-15,000 phones that the company has launched. Nonetheless, Motorola phones may not be very eye-catching, but it has a lot of other pros that can catch your fancy. The Moto G51 is tall but not scrawny. The phone feature a punch-hole display. The rear panel has a matte finish and a Motorola logo engraved at the centre, but it doesn't double up as a fingerprint scanner. The matte finish at the rear panel keeps the fingerprints and smudges at bay.

The rear panel also houses an oval-shaped camera module that has three large sensors and LED lights. The phone has a polycarbonate built quality but does not look very cheap. On the right side, there are volume rockers, a power button and a button to summon the Google Assistant. The Google Assistant button is placed at the top edge of the phone. Due to its longish form factor, it gets difficult to access the Google Assistant button. There is a 3.55mm jack, USB-Type C port, and speaker grille on the bottom. The top has been left untouched. However, the downside to the whole thing is that the smartphone is quite heavy and feels like an electronic slab, but it is pretty sturdy.

The phone features a 6.8-inch LCD display with FHD+ resolution and a high refresh rate 120Hz. The bezels around the corners are marginally thin, with a thick chin at the bottom. The display is adequately bright even outdoors, but it is definitely not one of the vibrant displays I have seen on a smartphone of late. The much cheaper Infinix Note 11 has a better display. Having said that, its bigger display comes into play, especially you like watching movie shows on mobile or playing games.

Moto G51 review: Performance

The Moto G51 is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 480+ chipset. It is the first smartphone to introduce the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480+ in the Indian market. The processor is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, which can be expandable using a microSD card. This is the only variant the phone comes in. The processor is believed to be a step-up over the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480. I did not encounter any visible lags with the smartphone during my usage. The Moto G51 handles the basic chores pretty well, and even while playing games, it does not overheat or stutter.

The smartphone runs on Android 11 and provides a near-stock Android experience. The phone is upgradeable to Android 12. The best thing about using a Motorola phone is that you do not have to deal with spammy ads from pre-loaded bloatware in almost every Android smartphone these days. It is a soothing sight to see your notification panel without any annoying ads. The Moto G51 comes pre-loaded with Google apps and Facebook, which is the only thing that one needs in a smartphone.

For people who are into gaming, the phone will not be a disappointment. The graphics may not be the best in the segment, but the phone did not heat while running titles such as BGMI or Candy Crush. There wasn't a significant drop in the battery either. So Moto G51 clearly did not turn out to be a bummer in that department either.

I usually spend my time watching shows on my mobile phones instead of the TV or laptop. So I had a great time watching web series and movies on the Moto G51, all thanks to its massive display. I did not notice any overheating there as well, even after a long-hour viewing. The audio quality of the phone is decent, to begin with. It only has a single speaker grille, but despite that, the phone was loud enough, and the sound did not get screechy at high volumes. However, if you are looking for a punchy, deep sound, you would be in for a disappointment. The same can be said about the call performance. It was clear and audible on both ends, however, a lot of the call quality depends on your network and the place you are in. The phone does not have much role to play there.

Now coming to the battery, the smartphone houses a 5000mAh battery and a 20W fast charging. The phone lasted me more than a day on a single charge. I am not an aggressive user and mainly browse social media sites or watch a couple of videos on my phone. But even for people who are glued to their devices 24*7, the battery would last around 15 hours at least. However, I noticed that the phone took an eternity to refill the juice completely. Even to reach the 20 per cent mark, the phone takes a good 30 minutes at least. To refill the juice, the phone would take around 2.5 hours.

Moto G51 review: Camera

The Moto G51 features a triple camera setup on the rear, which includes a 50MP OmniVision sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide and a 2-megapixel macro sensor. On the front, there is a 16-megapixel camera for selfies. The primary put up a great show, especially in good light conditions. The images are crisp, and the colour reproduction is fairly decent. The photos don't appear washed out, and the exposure is also managed pretty well. However, the primary sensor only shines bright when the lighting is adequate. It is not much of a performer in low-light conditions.

The pictures captured inside a poorly-lit room or when the sun goes down are grainy. You would either find the image to be filled with too much light or with too much noise. In low light conditions, the pictures are extra-brightened at times which takes away the originality. It misses out on the details, and colour reproduction is also not up to the mark. So for the primary sensor to perform to its fullest ability, adequate lighting is very important. The sensor falters the moment the light goes out.

Coming to the macro sensor, I was mighty impressed with the edge detection and the background blur. In some of the shots captured of flowers, you would notice the pistols and differentiated petals. The colour reproduction is pretty fine here as well. However, good-light conditions play a key role here as well. The macro sensors only perform well outdoors or in well-lit rooms. The picture quality drops in low light, and the images are saturated and grainy. The same can be said about the selfie camera, it captures the details well, the edge detection is perfect but requires good light to do so.

IMAGE SAMPLESMoto G51 review: Should you buy it?

Moto G51 handles the basic chores pretty well. The clean software experience is what you should get the phone for. Your notifications' panel with forever remain free of spammy ad links because the phone doesn't come with bloatware. The phone is especially good for watching movies or streaming web series. It is also a decent choice for gaming as the phone didn't overheat even after hour-long gaming sessions. The battery life is also good and lasts you a little over a day.

Now coming to the downsides, the phone comes with an LCD panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. The display is bright but not one of the best you will find in the market. The low-light camera performance of the smartphone could have been better. If these points are okay with you, then the Moto G51 will not disappoint you in any way.

Several big companies, including Samsung, and Dell, announced their latest products and services. Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S21 FE after a long delay, Alienware debuted its Concept Nyx game streaming server, and OnePlus used CES 2022 to reveal its latest flagship, the OnePlus 10 Pro. This year's CES officially runs from January 5 to 7.

Here's a recap of all the highlights from the Monday of CES 2022.

Samsung's first big smartphone of 2022 isn't the Galaxy S22 but the Galaxy S21 FE (the FE stands for Fan Edition). The long-delayed Galaxy S21 FE is essentially a stripped-down version of the flagship Galaxy S21 with a few trade-offs. The 'affordable' flagship features a 6.4-inch 120Hz display, a Snapdragon 888 chipset, and a lower price: $699 for the 128GB base model. The phone goes on sale in select countries next week. The Galaxy S21 FE joins Samsung's crowded smartphone lineup. The question really is: who is the target audience for the Galaxy S21 FE? The S21 FE sits between the regular Galaxy S21 and Galaxy A52.

The OnePlus 9 Pro is passé. enter OnePlus 10 Pro. OnePlus is using the week of CES 2022 to announce its first mega flagship of the year. Although the phone has no pricing or specs, the company did share a picture of the device. It's exactly what rumours have suggested. The high-end smartphone is rumoured to include a 6.7-inch QHD Plus display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 CPU, 12GB of RAM, support for 5G networks and a 5,000-mAh battery. As for cameras, the phone is expected to come with a 48-megapixel primary shooter to go with a 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle and 8-megapixel telephoto. The OnePlus 10 Pro will run on a new unified operating system that combines its Android-based OxygenOS with Oppo's ColorOS. OnePlus plans to launch its latest flagship in China on Jan 11.

Dell's Alienware brand has been showing concept devices at CES, and this year is no different. Concept Nyx joins a long list of concept devices coming from Dell's staple at CES 2022, which is essentially an at-home server that can stream games throughout the home. The idea behind the product is to let users stream multiple games to multiple devices at once, regardless of the hardware they're playing on. For now, Alienware's Concept Nyx is just a prototype at the moment and the brand has not yet to bring the device to the mass market.

L'Oréal has become a yearly name at CES, and 2022 is no different. This time, they are showcasing Colorsonic, a device that resembles a hair straightener, but is actually aimed at letting you apply hair colour evenly, and without the mess that the process usually entails. The Colorsonic will deliver consistent hair colour results, claims the company, and the device will officially be released in 2023.

The Colorsonic will let users choose from over 40 shades, and with the touch of a button, the device is ready to go for hair colour application. It has hair brush-like bristles on the top, which deliver the colour, and it relies on a colour cartridge to mix and create the hair colour. Based on the video that Loreals has shared, applying hair colour is as easy as combing your hair. One just has to wash the hair after the process and their new colour will shine through.

We don't know how much this device will cost when it actually hit the market, but it might just change how we colour hair at home, if it actually works as smoothly as it does in the demo video.

Jabra has used CES 2022 to introduce its $119 Elite 4 Active, a set of waterproof, active noise cancelling (ANC) earbuds. They offer a secure and comfortable fit without the need for hooks or wingtips. The earbuds have an IP57 rating, a transparency mode that lets you bring the outside world in, and support for both AAC and aptX Bluetooth codecs. Jabra claims seven hours per charge in the earbuds, with a total of 28 hours when you include the charging case. They are already available in select markets, in navy, black and light mint.

A backpack with a built-in location tracker? Well, Targus is making one and it uses Apple's Find My technology. The $149 Cypress Hero backpack has a built-in location tracker that could help the owner find the bag through the Find My network if it goes missing. And if your iPhone is lost you can press a button in the backpack to ping your phone. The Cypress Hero comes with a replaceable battery that's chargeable via USB. The ""smart"" bag will be available sometime in spring/summer 2022.

The Withings Body Scan, a new smart scale announced by the company at CES 2022, is way more capable. The Body Scan will do all the basic things it's supposed to do but it will take 6-lead ECG readings each time you weigh in. It has 14 electrodes on the base and another four in a retractable handle. In addition, the Body Scan will now break out your torso, arms and legs and display their specific composition in the companion app. Withings said it plans to launch the Body Scan scale in the second half of 2022 following FDA clearance. It will be priced at $299.95.

LG is showing off two new concept devices at CES 2022, and one of them is the ""Media Chair."" It is basically pitched as a ""modern relaxation device,"" which features a curved 55-inch OLED display with a recliner to form an entertainment pod of sorts. The curved display vibrates to produce audio without the need for external speakers. A button on the recliner arm allows the user to switch the OLED panel from vertical and horizontal orientations, allowing users to watch a movie with comfort. The OLED display uses tens of millions of self-emitting self-emitting pixels.

Samsung is making a remote that can be charged via radio waves from your router. Its new Eco Remote Remote draws power from radio waves emitted by Wi-Fi routers to keep itself charged. It has a USB-C port as a backup. The remote is environment friendly and uses recycled materials. Samsung plans to ship the remote later this year.","{'uri': 'indianexpress.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}",[],https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/01/CES-2022-fbb.jpg,,eng-7377109,False,0.5058823823928833,,378992760,1

VM-Fi provides turnkey 5G real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled simultaneous interpretation with wireless broadcasting to up to hundreds of personal smart devices.

The VM-Fi Smart 5G Blazing Fast AI Speech Translation System, which has been proven and used successfully in multiple MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions) and tourism settings in Taiwan, received global recognition in November when VM-Fi beat out 1,800 submissions to be named a CES 2022 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Smart Cities product category, said the company.

VM-Fi will be showcasing its technology at the Taiwan Tech Arena Pavilion at Booth 61423 and 61837 at the Las Vegas event.

""This recognition from CES underscores how groundbreaking our Smart 5G Blazing Fast AI Speech Translation System and encourages VM-Fi to continue on our mission to weave the future of smart city living by freeing the world of language barriers. As a CES 2022 Innovation Awards Honoree, VM-Fi's growth will be testament to the increasingly global, barrier-free 5G era of connectivity,"" said Maxwell Peng, CEO of VM-Fi.

Effective AI translation technology for MICE events

As the MICE industry recovers post-pandemic and moves to hybrid (in-person and digital) events, the need for real-time translation will take centre stage again. Onsite, simultaneous interpreters are incredibly expensive, taking into account setting up the interpreter's booth, audio system, and receiving radio booth.

The traditional way of running MICE and tourism events also eats up a massive amount of time, given that human interpreters are only able to translate a single sentence at a time. Both these time and cost barriers keep small businesses from competing on a level playing field with larger industry organizers, said the company.

VM-Fi said its Smart 5G Blazing Fast AI Speech Translation System enables businesses to reduce their dependence on human interpreters while simultaneously realizing cost and time savings of up to 3x. Using Qualcomm 5G technology and an in-house AI algorithm, VM-Fi delivers real-time human-like voice translation within a single-device turnkey solution that can broadcast up to hundreds of smart devices at your venue within 10 minutes of setting up via both 5G and Wi-Fi connectivity.

""We've seen first-hand how VM-Fi Smart 5G Blazing Fast AI Speech Translation System has been able to alleviate communication difficulties with international teachings, sightseeing tours, and even international business meetings,"" Peng explained.

Supported by Qualcomm, 5G technology applied to VM-Fi

In 2020, VM-Fi was shortlisted in the ""Qualcomm Innovate in Taiwan Challenge 2020"" and became a member of Qualcomm's global startup ecosystem. 5G technology then was applied to VM-Fi's one-to-many translation system. In 2021, through working with Qualcomm's 5G ecosystem and equipment companies, VM-Fi expanded its footprints in the global market.

""As the world's leading wireless technology innovator, Qualcomm is committed to helping partners enrich their services through wireless technology. I am very pleased to see that VM-Fi enhanced its product competitiveness, expanded into the global market, and shined on the stage of CES,"" said ST Liew, vice president, Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Asia-Pacific, and president, Qualcomm Taiwan and South East Asia. ""During the era of 2G, 3G, and 4G, the wireless application field was dominated by consumer smart phones and other smart devices, but with the 5G generation this instrument is just one of many branching points. More importantly, using AI and cloud services through 5G can create new intelligent services whether it be on smart devices, wireless transmissions, or other applications.""

For those who are unable to attend CES 2022 in person, VM-Fi will be conducting a live online demo via Zoom on Jan 3-8, 2022 every night from 9pm to 10pm Pacific Standard Time (PST).

The foldable smartphone market will soon have too many choices. After Oppo, Honor has teased the launch of its first-ever foldable smartphone dubbed Magic V. Honor has not revealed much about the smartphone through its teasers but has confirmed that it will launch its first-ever foldable smartphone. A couple of days ago, Oppo entered into the foldable smartphone market with the Find N.

Honor has confirmed that the Magic V will be launched in China on January 10. The company had teased another poster of the upcoming smartphone. The poster carries the render of the Magic V. Which shows an inward-folding design like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 3 and OPPO's Find N. Nothing much about the design or the specifications of the smartphone were revealed by the company.

A couple of weeks ago, Honor had confirmed on Weibo that its next flagship device will be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. Although the company did not confirm the name of the device, reports suggest that it could be the Magic V. Currently, the Moto Edge X30 is the only device that is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, the flagship chipset by Qualcomm.

Honor has confirmed that the smartphone will be launched in China but has not revealed whether the phone will be made official in the global markets. The specifications of the Magic V are also kept under wraps. However, Honor will reveal some specifications ahead of the January 10 launch.

South Korean tech giant Samsung has finally launched its much-awaited smartphone Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2022. The year gone by also witnessed the launch of multiple smartphones from other brands that come with amazing flagship features as well. One such device was launched by OnePlus in the March of last year. OnePlus 9 came with features and specifications quite similar to the recently launched Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G, and here's a detailed comparison between both devices in order to help users who are looking to buy these smartphones make an informed choice.

Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G has quite a similar design to the base model of the Galaxy S21 series and comes with a display featuring a 6.4-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with support for a 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. It also has a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus for an added layer of protection. OnePlus 9, on the other hand, comes with a display featuring a 6.55-inch FHD+ flat-edge, flexible OLED display with support for a maximum brightness of 1100 nits, HDR10+ format, 120Hz refresh rate, and Super Video resolution.

Talking about the processors of the devices, Galaxy S21 FE 5G features both Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chipset along with Exynos 2100 chipset depending on the region the device is being sold. Devices with Qualcomm chipsets are usually sold in the US and China, whereas Exynos 2100 variant is released for the rest of the world. OnePlus 9, on the other hand, is powered by the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC under the hood.

Talking about the camera module of the handset, Galaxy S21 FE 5G comes with a triple rear camera setup featuring a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, 12MP wide-angle camera, and an 8MP telephoto camera along with a 32MP selfie sensor at the front. On the other hand, the OnePlus 9 also features a triple rear camera setup but comes with a 48MP Sony IMX689 primary sensor along with a revolutionary 50MP ultra-wide-angle free form lens and a 2Mp monochrome lens. The handset also features a 16MP sensor for selfies and video calling at the front.

Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G features up to 8GB of RAM bundled up with 128GB or 256GB of onboard storage. OnePlus 9 features model variants with 8GB and 12GB of RAM along with 128GB and 256GB of internal storage. Galaxy S21 FE 5G is backed by a 4500mAh battery and supports 25W fast charging and 15W fast wireless charging. OnePlus 9, on the contrary, features a battery backup of 4,500mAh and supports Warp Charge 65T.

Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G operates on One UI 4.0 based on Android 12 out of the box and comes with an IP68 rating, Eye Comfort Shield and Samsung Knox security. Moreover, the box of the device doesn't come with the charging brick, and it has to be purchased separately. OnePlus 9 comes with additional features, including support for Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2 and has a USB-Type C port for fast charging.

The price of the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G has been listed on the UK website of the company as GBP 699, which is approximately Rs 70,200 for the 128GB variant, whereas the 256GB variant of the device is available at EUR 749, which is somewhere around Rs 75,200. It is expected that the device will arrive in India with a price tag of somewhere around Rs 50,000.

OnePlus 9, on the other hand, was launched at a price tag of Rs 49,999 for an 8GB RAM + 128GB internal storage variant, whereas the 12GB + 256GB variant of the smartphone was priced at Rs 54,999. The handset comes in three colour options - Astral Black, Winter Mist, and Arctic Sky.","{'uri': 'telecomtalk.info', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TelecomTalk'}","[{'uri': 'anupam_sharma@telecomtalk.info', 'name': 'Anupam Sharma', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://telecomtalk.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-5g-vs-oneplus-1024x683.jpg,0.3568627450980393,eng-7377109,False,0.7215686440467834,0.3568627450980393,378991800,2

But on January 4th, Samsung officially unveiled the device in line with the opening of CES 2022.

For $699, the Galaxy S21 FE brings consumers an option with key features from the Galaxy S21 Series and boasts improved hardware. So, while it is a distinct upgrade from the Galaxy S20FE, how does this phone stack against the year-old Galaxy S21? A flagship phone, which in some cases is available for a similar or lower asking price. Read this article to find out.

If you stack the Galaxy S21 FE next to the Galaxy S21, you will notice that the Fan Edition is slightly larger and sports a 6.4-inch display. The latter has a 6.2-inch panel. Now, both phones also use a flat display, covered with Gorilla Glass Victus, and avoid any curvature. But they do feature a minor difference in their bezel design and high refresh rate functionality. Also, under the screen, the Galaxy S21 FE features an optical fingerprint scanner, unlike the ultrasonic one on Galaxy S21.

S21 FE can switch between two modes, i.e., 60Hz and 120Hz, while the S21 can adapt its refresh rate between 48Hz and 120Hz, based on the content displayed on the screen.

And if you pay attention to the design of the two devices, you will notice the S21 has a higher level of fit and finish, apparent in the way its camera module appears flush with its aluminum frame. The S21 FE opts for a design that leaves its midsection disjoint from the camera array, which has polycarbonate material surrounding the lenses.

For colors, both phones are available in four options. The Galaxy S21 is available in Grey, White, Pink, and Lavender and has a two-tone look because of the metal frame, which features a contrasting shade. On the other hand, Galaxy S21 FE has a single color look with a palette that includes Graphite (a Grey shade), White, Lavender, and Olive.

In North America, both Galaxy S21 FE and Galaxy S21 feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, meaning performance is a metric Samsung isn't compromising on, and both phones will perform at a similar level. Though, you may see an advantage with Galaxy S21 as it ships with 8GB of RAM, regardless of the storage variant you purchase -- 128GB or 256GB.

Other regions have seen Galaxy S21 feature the Exynos 2100, and we expect the same for Galaxy S21 FE.

For the Galaxy S21 FE, Samsung has three variants, two with 128GB of storage and 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and another 256GB model with 8GB of RAM. Availability may vary according to region, so keep an eye out for this!

Looking at their camera specifications on paper, both Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21 FE seem to feature a level of similarity in their Wide and Ultrawide lenses. Both phones use 12MP sensors here, with an aperture of 1.8 on the wide lens and 2.2 on the ultrawide.

Where Samsung has cut corners is the Telephoto camera on Galaxy S21 FE. Here the Korean OEM uses an 8MP sensor instead of the 64MP unit found on Galaxy S21. They've also made a change in the front camera, as Galaxy S21 FE features a 32MP camera, whereas the Galaxy S21 has a 10MP unit.

Since both front cameras feature a similar aperture, the higher megapixel count could result in better photos, although you will have to wait for our full review to learn more.

With Galaxy S21 FE, the increase in size has allowed Samsung to package a 4500mAh battery into the phone, which is 12.5% more capacity than the 4000mAh unit available in the Galaxy S21. This change has led to Samsung claiming the Galaxy S21 FE will last for 79 hours when used for audio playback compared to the 68 hours rating for the Galaxy S21.

While overall optimization of software can play a role in battery performance, it wouldn't be hard to presume that Galaxy S21 FE should provide users with a little more screen time.

At $699, the Galaxy S21 FE does offer a great package. It sports a great display, a highly capable set of cameras, and even ships with Android 12 out of the box. But in a market where the Pixel 6 exists, and there is a possibility of price cuts for Galaxy S21, this is a device that some might want to skip.","{'uri': 'pocketnow.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pocketnow'}",[],https://media.pocketnow.com/styles/large/public/2022-01/LI%20Samsung%20Galaxy%20S21FE%20vs%20Samsung%20Galaxy%20S21.jpg?itok=v02XTQ2T,0.02745098039215677,eng-7377109,False,0.9137254953384399,0.02745098039215677,378991440,1

The phone that first debuted in China carries the Snapdragon 888 chipset that also powers the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro phones. Notably, the new phone's launch in India is revealed when the company is planning to introduce the OnePlus 10 Pro in China this month. It is likely the global and India launch of the OnePlus 10 Pro will take place post-March 2022, giving the new device some room for sales.

It will be interesting to see how the phone will be priced in India since OnePlus already sells the OnePlus 9R 5G at Rs 39,999, and the OnePlus 9 costs Rs 48,000 onwards. Some reports suggest OnePlus might discontinue the sale of the OnePlus 9R 5G in India.

The China and India-specific variants of the OnePlus 9RT 5G may share the same specifications. That means the phone would get a 6.62-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The screen would also get a hole-punch cutout for the single 16-megapixel selfie snapper. The OnePlus 9RT 5G would carry a 50-megapixel camera with OIS support, a 2-megapixel macro sensor, and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle snapper. Similar to the OnePlus 9R, this phone lacks Hasselblad-powered cameras that are available on the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro. As mentioned, we get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset that comes paired with Adreno 660 GPU, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of UFS3.1 storage. Some of the connectivity options include Bluetooth v5.2 support, NFC, 5G, and dual-band Wi-Fi. Similar to the last few OnePlus phones, we still get a 4,500mAh battery unit that supports Flash Charge 65T fast charging.

Meanwhile, OnePlus India will also launch the OnePlus Buds Z2 true wireless earbuds alongside the OnePlus 9RT 5G on January 14. Its specifications were revealed last month.","{'uri': 'news18.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'News18'}",[],https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2022/01/oneplus_9rt-164129295916x9.jpg,0.1450980392156862,eng-7376935,False,0.9019607901573181,0.1450980392156862,378991140,1

Along with a Snapdragon 695 5G chipset and a "" AMOLED display, the smartphone will be launched in India soon and will be available to purchase from Flipkart. To recall, the smartphone was launched by Motorola alongside two other smartphones: the Moto G31 and the Moto G51 which are already available in the Indian market.

On January 4, 2022, Motorola India revealed the launch date of Motorola Moto G71 5G to be January 10, 2021. Earlier, this date was also tipped by an Indian tipster. The smartphone will be placed in the budget segment and is likely to be priced around Rs. 25,000 in India. In Europe, the device was launched with a price of EUR 299.99, which roughly translates to Rs. 25,200. Find the detailed specifications of the Motorola Moto G71 below.

Now, though, we've just got an unprecedented look at the second major Android phone launch of the new year, too, with full specs and front and back images of the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G breaking cover.

And the great news for lovers of the very best phones is that both handsets look dynamite - they are without doubt going to be two of 2022's best 5G phones. But which will be the better buy? That's the question that is now occupying my mind.

Now, on paper, that looks like an incredible Android phone flagship. Buckets of performance, supremely impressive charging technology (and with a large battery capacity, too), a powerful suite of cameras designed by a camera master in Hasselblad, and OnePlus's always super speedy and impressive OxygenOS.

But, for me at least, I still honestly can't decide if it is the better buy when compared to the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G, which has the following reported specs:

Dimensions: Unknown

Screen: 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, HDR10+, 1440 x 3200 pixels

Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 895 / Exynos 2200

RAM: 12/16GB LPDDR5

Storage: 128GB/256GB/512GB UFS 3.1

Battery: 5000 mAh

Charging: Unknown (fast charging)

Rear cameras: 108MP+10MP+10MP+12MP

Front camera: 40MP

OS: Android 12, One UI 4

On paper, as you can see, there is basically nothing between the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G and the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G, although I'd say the S22 Ultra 5G is the slightly better equipped handset in terms of hardware. Both are equipped with some of the very best Android phone technology on the market today, though, and both will offer premium, top-table phone experiences.

However, there's two things that I think could make the difference for me (and no doubt other Android phone users) when it comes round to picking between them - price and the S22 Ultra 5G's unique party piece - its S Pen digital stylus.

The return of full S Pen digital stylus functionality in the S22 Ultra 5G (which was last seen in the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 series) is no doubt a feather in the S22 Ultra 5G's cap as it is a feature that the OnePlus 10 Pro just can't match.

Fans of the Samsung Galaxy Note series will no doubt be majorly swayed by its inclusion in the South Korean maker's incoming flagship.

However, for me at least, the price has to be right for that to be considered a bonus over the OnePlus 10 Pro.

OnePlus flagships have been getting steadily more expensive over the past 5 years and the maker's reputation of a producer of cheap flagship killers isn't quite so clear cut as it once was.

But if the OnePlus 10 Pro does retail for markedly less than the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G then I know a lot of Android phone users, and notably those who don't care about digital stylus functionality, are going to have their heads turned.

Price, therefore, is going to be really important here.

For me I'm going to wait until there is more clarity of pricing and, to be honest, release dates, too, as we still don't officially know when either flagship is going to hit the market. My gut tells me we will see the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G in the west a few months before the OnePlus 10 Pro, but whether or not it is will be worth the wait will be largely down to its pricing and performance, both of which are yet to be determined.

Watch this space, then, as T3 will naturally report on both flagships as soon as we get more information.

OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has also shared a post on Twitter confirming the January 11 launch date of the smartphone. Last month, the company announced that the device will be powered by the newly launched Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset and now, the company has shared the images of the OnePlus 10 Pro revealing key design elements.

The images revealed that the smartphone will feature a triple rear camera setup that is co-developed with Hasselblad. The company partnered with the Swedish photography equipment company for OnePlus 9 Pro as well. It is also confirmed that the smartphone will be available in at least two colour options - Volcanic Black and Emerald Forest. The rear of the OnePlus 10 Pro appears to have a matte finish while at the front, the smartphone features a curved display with a punch-hole style notch at the top-left corner that houses the selfie camera.

Pete Lau previously revealed that the device will feature an LTPO 2.0 display. For those who don't know, LTPO stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide and it is a special type of OLED panel. This technology allows the display to have a flexible refresh range up to 120Hz. It also consumes less power as compared to LTPS OLED displays. As per a post by Digital Chat Station on Weibo, the OnePlus 10 Pro will offer 80W wired fast charging support and 50W wireless fast charging support.

The device was also spotted on benchmarking platform Geekbech last week. The device reportedly scored 976 in the single-core test and 3469 in the multi-core test. The listing also reveals that the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC on the device will be paired with 12GB of RAM. It is worth noting that the device has scored less than the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro.

OnePlus 10 Pro rumoured specification

OnePlus 10 Pro is rumoured to sport a 6.7-inch 1440p display. The display is said to have a peak refresh rate of 120Hz. Under the hood, the smartphones will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. The SoC is rumoured to be paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. Reports suggest that the smartphone may come in two combinations of RAM and storage configurations, 8GB and 12GB RAM and 128GB and 256GB of storage.

When it comes to camera, the smartphone will have a triple camera setup at the back reportedly consisting of a 48MP primary lens, 50MP ultra-wide lens, and an 8MP 3x telephoto lens. For selfie and video calls, the OnePlus 10 Pro is said to have a 32MP camera at the front.","{'uri': 'gadgetsnow.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gadget Now'}",[],"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,msid-88689067,imgsize-49556,width-800/88689067.jpg",0.1764705882352942,eng-7376935,False,0.7411764860153198,0.1764705882352942,378990540,2

The company has confirmed that its next flagship device, the OnePlus 10 Pro, will be launched next week. But before that, CEO Pete Lau has released official marketing renders to confirm the phone's design.

Lau shared a total of eight OnePlus 10 Pro images in two separate posts on Weibo. A machine translation of one of Lau's posts reads, ""We have adopted a brand new design language that breaks the boundaries and has a unique style.""

It is worth noting that the confirmed design of the OnePlus 10 Pro corroborated previous leaks from OnLeaks. At the time, tech fans were quick to point out some similarities between the upcoming device and the Samsung Galaxy S21 series. It appears that the next OnePlus flagship will also use a contour cut design for the rear camera bump.

So far, the company has confirmed that the OnePlus 10 Pro will be available in two color options called Volcanic Black and Emerald Forest. But it is still unknown if there will be more variants to be announced.

The camera bump still features the Hasselblad logo, confirming that the OnePlus 10 Pro camera features were developed with the company. An earlier report from 91Mobiles claimed that the triple camera array would be composed of a 48MP primary sensor, 50MP ultra-wide lens, and an 8MP telephoto sensor with 3.3x zoom.

OnePlus 10 Pro is also expected to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, the latest premium SoC from Qualcomm. It is also rumored to sport a 5000mAh battery that is speculated to support up to 125W wired fast charging.

OnePlus also confirmed that the OnePlus 10 Pro would be launched in China on Tuesday, Jan. 11. But its global launch will likely happen at a later time. The latest official teasers have also emphasized that the next launch event will focus on the Pro model. And there are indications that the regular OnePlus 10 phone could arrive later. While the company has yet to discuss its launch timeline for the upcoming flagship, a staggered release for the OnePlus 10 series is likely one of the effects of the continuing supply chain issues.","{'uri': 'econotimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'EconoTimes'}",[],https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20220104ffad748d7a8631816_th_1024x0.jpg,0.1058823529411765,eng-7376935,False,0.8235294222831726,0.1058823529411765,378990480,1

But its cheaper sibling, the vanilla OnePlus 10, hasn't got as much limelight. Today, we have an interesting bit of information about the latter though. According to tipster Yogesh Brar (via MySmartPrice), the OnePlus 10 could ship with MediaTek's Dimensity 9000 SoC over Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. The OnePlus 10 Pro will reportedly get the latter.

This comes as a surprise for a couple of reasons. Firstly, OnePlus has always used Snapdragon chipsets in its flagship models. Until the Nord 2 last year, which featured the MediaTek Dimensity 1200 SoC, it also used Qualcomm processors in its lower-cost models. On top of that, the OnePlus 10 and OnePlus 10 Pro are two models in the same series.

Of course, the two models will vary in several aspects. The former could be a smaller package, meaning a smaller battery and screen. We could also see some differences in the camera department as well. But when it comes to the processor, fans would want to see consistency across the OnePlus 10 and OnePlus 10 Pro. People already hate Samsung for using different chipsets in the same phone in different markets. We are, of course, not talking about the same phone here, but using the same processor in two models in the same series will enable buyers to make an informed selection.

It's not like the Dimensity 9000 is inferior to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or vice versa. We don't know that yet. MediaTek has high hopes on its latest chipset to help it close the gap on Qualcomm in the flagship market. And it appears to be on the way to doing just that. The OnePlus 10 using the Dimensity 9000 is a big win for the Taiwanese company.

OnePlus last year merged with Oppo. The two firms are also combining their respective custom Android skins, OxygenOS and Color OS, to form a new unified OS that will ship with future OnePlus and Oppo phones. It appears the development has progressed enough for the companies to start testing it. According to the new report, testing will begin soon globally. It will likely be based on Android 12.

As far as the OnePlus 10 series launch is concerned, the same source had previously claimed that the two models will not launch at the same time. The OnePlus 10 Pro could arrive as early as next week but the vanilla OnePlus 10 could keep us waiting for a few more months. We will keep you posted.","{'uri': 'androidheadlines.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Headlines'}",[],https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AH-OnePlus-3T-new-logo-image-1.jpg,0.0980392156862746,eng-7376935,False,0.7764706015586853,0.0980392156862746,378990480,2

Current and former employees with vested Esops as of December 2021 are eligible to sell all their vested Esops.

The move is aimed at helping the startup attract and retain good talent while bolstering the company's vision of building technology and infrastructure for farmers, resellers, retailers, consumers, and supply chain participants.

This is Ninjacart's second Esop buyback, the first one was in 2019. The latest Esop buyback announcement follows Flipkart and Walmart announcing a fresh round of joint strategic investment in Ninjacart worth $145 million in December 2021.

According to Thirukumaran Nagarajan, co-founder and CEO of Ninjacart, the move is aimed at recognising the work of ""our current and previous employees who stood by us and helped us achieve every milestone with their extraordinary effort"". ""This Esop buyback programme is a small gesture of our gratitude towards our employees because, without them, we will not be where we are today. Esop buyback plans offer people a true chance at wealth creation and it allows employees to participate in the company's success which has only been possible through their hard work and loyalty,"" he said.

In 2019 December, the company raised funding from Walmart and its Indian e-commerce arm Flipkart, and did a follow-on round of funding in October 2020. It also secured $90 million from US-based investment firm Tiger Global Management in April 2019. Ninjacart's other investors include venture capital firms Accel, US-based Qualcomm Ventures, Russia's HR Capital, Japanese venture capital firm-cum-accelerator Mistletoe, Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani's NRJN Trust and South Korea-based Neoplux, the venture arm of Doosan Corp.

Ninjacart, operated by 63Ideas Infolabs Pvt Ltd, was founded in 2015. It began as a hyperlocal grocery delivery company and then shifted to a business-to-business setup. Farmers can sell vegetables and fruit directly to business establishments such as shops, retailers and restaurants via the startup's platform. Ninjacart says it works closely with the farmers and has till date helped over 1,00,000 farmers across 150 villages to generate better revenue.

The company says it is looking to ""acquire more skilled professionals, develop a healthy working environment for its employees, and hire people with leadership characteristics"", going forward.

To be sure, startups such as Ninjacart are bending backwards to sweeten deals for in a bid to hire and retain employees in this competitive market. Last year, 32 Indian startups spent close to ₹3,000 crore, or about $440 million, to buy back Esops, according to a VCCircle analysis in December. In comparison, 12 companies reportedly bought back close to $50 million worth of Esops from their employees in 2020.

Esops are usually allocated to qualifying employees of the company at the time of hiring, during appraisals or at the time of reward program announcements. They have a vesting period during which the employees cannot sell their holdings, but, once the vesting period is over, the company may facilitate a buyback option or the employees may choose to sell their shares as part of the secondary offering during the time of a fundraising exercise in the company to liquidate their holdings.

Esop buybacks became popular in 2021 as startups fought hard to retain and hire talent. One in three start-ups that announced Esop buybacks during the year also turned unicorns. The names included Browserstack, upGrad, Sharechat, Zetwerk, Meesho, Licious, Vedantu, Moglix, PharmEasy, Acko, and Cred.","{'uri': 'livemint.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'mint'}",[],https://images.livemint.com/img/2022/01/04/600x338/ninjacart-kzhG--621x414@LiveMint_1556082621756_1641293890883.jpg,0.3411764705882352,eng-7382427,False,0.7176470756530762,0.3411764705882352,378990300,1

It was a surprising omission, especially considering the feature was available on most of the company's previous earbuds including the Elite 65t, ELite 75t, and Elite 85t. At the launch time, Jabra promised that it would rollout multipoint support via a firmware update sometime in January. And it looks like that update is just around the corner.

At CES 2022, Jabra announced (via Android Police) that it will soon be adding multipoint support to the Jabra Elite 7 Pro and Elite 7 Active. The company says it will issue an update ""in early 2022,"" but won't provide a specific timeline. But as they say better late than never.

Multipoint is an immensely useful feature for those who have to juggle between multiple devices. As the name suggests the feature allows your Bluetooth device to maintain an active connection to up to two devices simultaneously. In theory, this enables you to stream music from your laptop while also being able to receive notifications and calls from your smartphone.

As a refresher, the Jabra Elite 7 Pro and Elite 7 Active were launched last year in August alongside the Elite 3.

The news came alongside the announcement of the Jabra Elite 4 Active, a watered-down version of the Elite 7 Active. The new TWS feature a slightly updated design and swap out touch controls for physical buttons. The Elite 4 Active retains active noise cancellation (ANC) and also boasts IP57 dust and water protection.

Throughout next year, the report will include updated quarterly rankings of the worldwide top-25 semiconductor suppliers.

The 17 companies forecast to have worldwide semiconductor (IC and O S D -- optoelectronic, sensor, and discrete) sales of >$10.0 billion in 2021 are shown here. Three semiconductor companies -- AMD, NXP, and Analog Devices -- are expected to join the noteworthy ""megasuppliers"" list in 2021.

These megasuppliers include nine suppliers headquartered in the U.S., three in Europe, two in Taiwan and South Korea, and one in Japan. The list includes six fabless companies (Qualcomm, Nvidia, Broadcom, MediaTek, AMD, and Apple) and one pure-play foundry (TSMC). In total, the megasuppliers' sales are expected to jump by 26% in 2021 compared to 2020, one point greater than the forecasted total worldwide semiconductor industry 2021/2020 increase of 25%.

In order to make the year-over-year growth rate comparisons more reflective of actual growth, the sales figures include each company's semiconductor sales from acquisitions in 2020 and 2021 regardless of when the acquisition was finalized. For example, Analog Devices officially closed its deal to acquire Maxim on August 25, 2021.

However, IC Insights added Maxim's full-year 2020 IC sales of $2,354 million to Analog Devices' 2020 semiconductor sales for a total of $8,127 million. Moreover, $665 million was added to Analog Devices' 1Q21 sales to account for Maxim's 1Q21 revenue with another $720 million added to Analog Devices' 2Q21 sales to reflect Maxim's semiconductor sales in that timeperiod. Since the deal was finalized at the end of August, about two-thirds the way through 3Q21, $500 million in sales was added to Analog Devices' 3Q21 sales. With these adjustments, Analog Devices' 2021/2020 semiconductor sales are forecast to jump by 24%.

Growth rates among the 17 2021 megasuppliers are expected to range from AMD's 65% to Intel's -1%. Four companies -- AMD, MediaTek, Nvidia, and Qualcomm -- are forecast to post a sales gain of greater than 50% this year.

Samsung's semiconductor sales are forecast to be nearly $83.1 billion in 2021, making it the largest semiconductor supplier this year. Driven by a resurgent memory market and relatively flat sales results from Intel, Samsung once again replaced Intel as the leading semiconductor producer beginning in 2Q21.

With the DRAM market NAND flash markets showing strong growth in 2021, Samsung is forecast to register a 34% increase in 2021/2020 sales and open up a $7.5 billion lead over second-ranked Intel this year.","{'uri': 'dqindia.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'DATAQUEST'}",[],https://www.dqindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Biodegradable-computer-chips-300x212.jpg,0.1764705882352942,,False,0,0.1764705882352942,378989820,2

According to Windows Central, the tech giant may skip the standard Android 12 release and go for Android 12L on the Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2.

Google recently announced a preview of Android 12L, which may sound like a new version of Android, but Google calls it ""a special feature drop that makes Android 12 even better on large screens"".

The idea here is to provide users on tablets, foldables and Chrome OS laptops -- anything with a screen above 600 dp -- with an improved user interface.

Coming back to Microsoft Surface Duo, it features two 5.6-inch OLED (1,350x1,800 pixels) displays with 4:3 aspect ratio that join together to provide an 8.1-inch PixelSense Fusion display with 2,700 x 1,800 pixels resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio.

Under the hood, the Surface Duo has an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC, paired with 6GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage.

There are also two batteries, with an overall capacity of 3,577mAh.","{'uri': 'socialnews.xyz', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Social News XYZ'}",[],https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?id=news/C-1-1427717&txt=Microsoft+misses+deadline+for+Surface+Duo%27s+Android+11+update,0.1450980392156862,eng-7378231,False,0.8313725590705872,0.1450980392156862,378989280,1

From massive dislocations in the container market, shipping routes, air cargo, roads, rail lines and warehouses, to a shortage of logistics workers - all of these factors have strained the global supply chain. As Covid-induced lockdowns are easing, consumer demand is expected to increase substantially going forward. However, supply chains that were disrupted during the crisis are still facing huge challenges and are struggling to get back on track. This, in turn, has led to an anarchy of sorts amongst manufacturers and distributors who are unable to produce or supply to the tune they did during the pre-pandemic era.

Stress on the global supply chain started during the 'trade war' between the US and China. Several tariffs and sanctions were bilaterally imposed by the two countries, creating volatility in demand and supply. This unexpected shift in trade put the initial stress on the global logistics industry. The crisis further unfolded as industries around the world were forced to shut down amid the pandemic and weak links across the global supply chain began to surface. The lack of workers across the supply chain resulted in congested ports, stalled ships, overloaded warehouses, delays, empty shelves, and eventually higher prices. Amid higher consumer demand, freight rates for merchandise coming from China to the US and Europe soared, while a shortage of truck drivers exacerbated the problem of getting goods to their final destinations.

Multiple industries have been affected by the supply chain blockages, leading to a shortage of not only essentials like food items and medicines, but also technology components, electronics and automotive sectors. Continued delays in the delivery of key inputs is likely to cause a decline in manufacturing, making economic recovery from the pandemic-led slowdown even more difficult. This is already visible in some sectors such as automotive. Toyota Motors, for example, planned a worldwide production cut of 40 per cent in September 2021 due to the computer chip shortage. Similarly, Ford Motors plans to abandon a plant near Kansas City that manufactures its profitable F-150 pickup truck, while General Motors has stopped most of its truck production in North America, closing four of its plants because of the chip shortage. US car production dropped by 72 per cent in the year to August 2021, with just under one million new vehicles being built compared to 3.6 million during the same period in 2019. Similarly, the German automotive industry faced the worst semiconductor supply shortage in 30 years with over 80 per cent of the companies in the sector affected, while Mexico's manufacturing experienced a 27 per cent drop in July 2021 due to the lack of semiconductors.

The semiconductor industry was one of the few industries to exit 2020 with resilience. Global semiconductor revenues grew 6.5 per cent to $439bn during the year, as the new lifestyle triggered by the lockdown restrictions boosted demand for at-home applications for work, education and entertainment. However, microchips and other semiconductors - which form the core for billions of products such as smartphones, data centres, computers and vehicles - faced the direct impact of the global supply chain crisis. The inexpensive chips have now started to cause losses worth billions of dollars to major industries across the globe. According to Goldman Sachs, approximately 169 industries have been impacted by this shortage.

At the heart of the supply chain crisis for semiconductors lies the market concentration of manufacturers. Over half of all the chips supplied globally are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), which supplies US majors such as Apple, Qualcomm and Amazon cloud computers. TSMC controls more than half of the made-to-order chip foundry market and has a lock on top-end technologies used in components for smartphones, servers, games consoles and even weapon systems. Notably, 94 per cent of the company's production capacity is geographically concentrated within a 100 mile radius, significantly aggravating the problem of the already pressurised global supply links. On the other hand, with Malaysia - the largest supplier of ECUs - returning to normalcy, the automotive industry in the Far East and Asian regions is recovering with semiconductor supplies anticipated to resume by the first quarter of 2022.

There is now an urgent need for companies to move from 'just-in-time' to 'just-in-case' production processes and build a resilient inventory strategy. Additionally, it is important to consider geographical diversity of supply chains, with more flexible systems that are highly adaptable to changes. Companies should also adapt or redesign micro supply chains for critical components rather than applying a one-size-fits-all supply chain procurement model. This is increasingly important for the chip industry. While short-term measures can ease the situation temporarily, companies will have to adapt newer methods of production and distribution in the longer run to ensure continuity and growth in the face of a crisis.","{'uri': 'gulfbusiness.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gulf Business'}","[{'uri': 'varun_godinho@gulfbusiness.com', 'name': 'Varun Godinho', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://gulfbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-07-12-at-1.28.43-PM.png,-0.3960784313725491,,False,0,-0.3960784313725491,378989040,1

The company is seeking commitments for as much as 50 billion rupees of notes maturing in five years at a coupon rate of 6.20%, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter.

Jio did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

The operator plans to use the proceeds from the proposed bond sale to meet its financial liabilities, Bloomberg said.

With 426.6 million wireless subscribers as of October 2021, Jio is India's largest mobile phone carrier.

Its launch in 2016 and offerings of free calls and cut-price data plans shook up the country's telecoms sector, forcing rivals to respond with their own cuts and leading to consolidation.

Reliance Jio raised billions of dollars in funding rounds in 2020 from investors, including Alphabet's Google, Facebook, Qualcomm and Intel.

The Galaxy S21 FE is essentially a watered-down flagship that has been launched globally. It is likely that the South Korean tech giant launches the Galaxy S21 FE in India that will compete with the upcoming OnePlus 9RT that is set to be unveiled in the country on January 14.

The Galaxy S21 FE is available at a starting price of $699 ( roughly Rs 52,031) in three storage variants: 6GB/128GB, 8GB/128GB, and 8GB/256GB.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G follows the legacy of the flagship Galaxy S21 range. Samsung has launched the handset in four new colour options -- Olive, Lavender, White and Graphite -- all of which include a stylish haze finish. The S21 FE 5G sports a sleek 7.9mm-thick body. The phone also packs an in-display (optical) fingerprint sensor, similar to what we have seen in the previous-gen Galaxy S20 FE.

Starting January 11, the Galaxy S21 FE 5G will be available through Samsung.com, carriers and retailers online and availability of the device will vary by market, according to Samsung.

""At Samsung, we are focused on bringing the latest mobile innovations to even more people,"" TM Roh, President and Head of Samsung Electronics' MX (Mobile eXperience) Business, said in a statement.

""We saw an incredible response to Galaxy S20 FE and Galaxy S21 lineup. So we applied the same approach with S21 FE 5G, equipping it with the premium features that matter most to our loyal Galaxy fans -- because we're focused on delivering a smartphone that meets their most important needs,"" Roh added.

Galaxy S21 FE 5G specifications and features

In terms of display, the Galaxy S21 FE has 6.4-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate in gaming mode.

As with the previous model, it is a ""fan edition"" that is supposed to shine with a particularly good price-performance ratio. The Galaxy S21 FE looks almost exactly like its older brothers. However, Samsung has thrown in a few more colors and covered the camera bump in plastic. All is not lost though, as there is IP68 certification against water and dust included as part of the deal.

As early as its unveiling on January 4 as part of CES 2022, Samsung has set both a launch date and price. The Galaxy S21 FE will be released on January 11, 2022 with 128GB of internal memory for $699.95, while those who hanker after larger storage space will have to fork out $769.99 for the 256GB model. Samsung has only announced the availability of this handset on its own online store, although you will probably be able to pick up the Galaxy S21 FE from various network operators and online retailers in due time.

Sporting an MSRP of $699.95, the Galaxy S21 FE is exactly $100 cheaper than the ""regular"" Galaxy S21. How the prices of the Galaxy S21 series have fallen in recent months can be read in the linked article. As with the previously released models, there is no room for memory expansion purposes, so you might want to get it right at purchase.

For the display, Samsung relies on Dynamic AMOLED with a refresh rate of 120 hertz. It measures 6.4 inches and is thus 0.1 inches smaller than the S20 FE. Gamers will also enjoy a sampling rate of 240 hertz. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chipset will be the heartbeat in the S21 FE, which should ensure a buttery smooth experience for mobile games. In addition, the 128GB version has 6GB of RAM, which increases to 8GB with the 256GB model. Armed with the Snapdragon 888 chipset automatically means the Galaxy S21 FE is 5G ready.

At the back of the Galaxy S21 FE, you will find a triple camera configuration that consists of a primary camera with 12 MP, an ultra-wide camera with 12 MP, and a telephoto camera with 8 MP resolution. Apart from the ultra-wide-angle camera, all lenses feature optical stabilization. Selfies are taken at a 32 MP resolution. In its press release, Samsung emphasized an improved night mode, which we hope will live up to its hype! Video fans can also enjoy dual video recording. We'll see what other camera features the S21 series offers in the review down the road.

Last but not least, the battery: It features a 4,500 mAh rating. With 25-watts quick-charging and 15-watts wireless charging, the Galaxy S21 FE retains the charging capabilities of its predecessor. If you like buying smartphones for the long haul, you can look forward to four years of security updates with the Galaxy S21 FE. The Galaxy S21 FE also comes with Android 12 via OneUI 4.0 out of the box, which automatically translates to this handset offering longer software support than the other S21 models.","{'uri': 'nextpit.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'AndroidPIT'}","[{'uri': 'authored_by@nextpit.com', 'name': 'Authored By', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'benjamin_lucks@nextpit.com', 'name': 'Benjamin Lucks', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://fscl01.fonpit.de/userfiles/7695213/image/Bildschirmfoto_2022-01-04_um_08.25.28.png,0.08235294117647052,eng-7377109,False,0.8745098114013672,0.08235294117647052,378987300,1

The majority of the world's stock market indexes enjoyed double-digit annual percentage increases and reached record highs. However, as the old saying goes, past performance does not predict future results.

Bearing that in mind, we asked some of Canada's Top Wealth Advisors how they're positioning clients' portfolios for this year, and which sectors, themes, and specific stocks they're looking at to deliver alpha in 2022.

""The recent sell-off in the markets presents an excellent buying opportunity for 2022,"" says Jay Smith, portfolio manager and investment advisor at CIBC Wood Gundy in Toronto.

He says the massive U.S. infrastructure bill will help fuel gross domestic product growth and further reduce unemployment.

Mr. Smith also notes that while interest rates will begin to rise in the U.S. and Canada in 2022, it will happen slowly, so the economic recovery will not be choked off.

""Easy money, low interest rates, and moderate inflation are the stuff that bull markets are made of,"" Mr. Smith says. ""Just like the swoon that followed [the] Delta [variant], the market could make new highs after the swoon created by Omicron dissipates.""

Mr. Smith highlights three sectors he thinks investors should overweight this year.

The first is Canadian banks - particularly Royal Bank of Canada RY-T, Toronto-Dominion Bank TD-T and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM-T.

He points to their recently announced dividend increases and share buybacks that followed the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions' removal of restrictions. He also says the reversal of loan-loss provisions taken during the pandemic will boost the banks' earnings.

Technology is Mr. Smith's second favoured sector. One of his preferred names is Nvidia Corp. NVDA-Q. He says the company's graphics processing units are used in most high-end computers, particularly for gaming. Nvidia's hardware is also key for crypto-mining and artificial intelligence applications, as well as the metaverse.

Two other tech stocks he likes are Qualcomm Inc. QCOM-Q and Apple Inc. AAPL-Q. Mr. Smith says Apple ""just keeps innovating and putting out incredible products at high enough prices to keep their margins pristine. Apple was making new highs while the market was hitting new lows. It's core to my portfolios, no pun intended.""

The third sector Mr. Smith highlights is pharmaceuticals. He notes Moderna Inc. MRNA-Q trades at 10 times earnings and went from US$14-million in revenue to US$16-billion in guaranteed government revenue in one year.

""That's what I call growth,"" he says. ""Some characterize it as a one-trick pony, but it has a pipeline of drugs that it's working on, including a flu shot that is 95 per cent effective, and drugs for HIV and oncology.""

Similarly, he likes the outlook for Pfizer Inc. PFE-N.

Money has to go somewhere, says David LePoidevin, director, wealth management, senior vice president and portfolio manager with the LePoidevin Group at Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management in Vancouver.

""When we look at the outlook for 2022, the question is where is the money going to go?"" he says. ""Cash has been paying zero in a period of 5 per cent inflation. Ten-year bonds pay just 1.4 per cent. So, with a deflation scenario, both of these look very unattractive.""

While the Bank of Canada has signalled interest rate hikes, he believes it will not likely raise rates to the point at which investment capital flows away from stocks. Altogether, he expects overall investor returns in the mid-single digits, including dividends.

Although Mr. LePoidevin says the major indexes could have a challenging year, ""well-selected value stocks should trounce the returns of cash or bonds.""

One stock he highlights is Manulife Financial Corp. MFC-T, noting its dividend yield of 5.5 per cent. He says its shares could rise to $30 each from about $24 at year-end if interest rates nudge higher and life insurers benefit from higher interest rates when they hedge their insurance contracts.

Mr. LePoidevin also favours gold producers, saying that several are trading at lows, and even with gold GCZ21 at current prices, they're generating ""huge"" cash flows.

For fixed income, Mr. LePoidevin favours fixed and floating preferred shares.

He says many issues are trading at discounts to par value and as the payouts on many will reset higher as interest rates increase.

Specifically, Mr. LePoidevin points to BCE Inc. BCE-T, which has three issues up for reset in 2022 that trade at a 20 per cent discount to par value.

Guy Côté, senior vice-president and portfolio manager at National Bank Financial Wealth Management in Montreal, expects some of the investing trends of 2021 to continue this year, with investors placing an even greater emphasis on profitability and predictable growth.

He says market participants will be looking for names with a clear ability to pass on inflationary pressures while growing their business at a healthy and sustainable rate.

Mr. Côté expects 2022 to be a stock-picker's market, in which opportunities will arise from increased volatility, shifting sector leadership, and a focus on company-specific attributes such as recurring revenue, market leadership, pricing power, and an impeccable balance sheet.

He is focusing specifically on opportunities related to the increased adoption of technology and the further electrification of society. He adds that advancements in technology have enabled companies to reduce the cost of goods sold while increasing their final output.

The Companies Mr. Côté sees gaining from this structural change include Microsoft Corp. MSFT-Q and ASML Holding NV ASML-Q, as well as Canadian firms Kinaxis Inc. KXS-T and Nuvei Corp. NVEI-T.

Mr. Côté says electrification will play a major role in helping society address climate change.

In Las Vegas, the Korean brand has just revealed its new high-end smartphone Galaxy S21 FE at a discount. mid-Galaxy S21, I-Galaxy S21 +The device will be marketed next Tuesday at 759 euros (6 + 128 GB) and 829 euros (8 + 256 GB). Until February 8, all Galaxy S21 FE buyers will get a free pair of headphones Galaxy Buds 2.

Product too late?

In our opinion, the problem with the Galaxy S21 FE is its release date. At €759, it will undoubtedly be one of the stars of Christmas. Unfortunately for Samsung, due to rumors of component shortages, the product cannot be produced in sufficient quantities to be available before the end of the year. His arrival in early 2022 will still allow him to capitalize on sales, but some customers have undoubtedly turned to Pixel 6 where is the Galaxy S20 FE From last year in the meantime.

Another question regarding location: the Galaxy S21 FE (759 euros) costs 10 euros more than the classic Galaxy S21 (749 euros). With the Galaxy S22 arriving in the next few weeks, one can wonder if the S21 won't quickly become more interesting. Fortunately for him, the Galaxy S21 FE has a few arguments that stand out.

Qualcomm chip under control

Like its predecessor, the Galaxy S21 FE does not use an Exynos chip but a Qualcomm chip. It is the Snapdragon 888 that brings the smartphone to life which, in all likelihood, should offer superior performance over other Galaxy S21 devices. Good news for users who, for once, will not have to complain about the heating problems of Samsung chips or their risky management of autonomy.

Other features of the Galaxy S21 FE include its large 6.4-inch OLED screen (compared to 6.2-inch for the S21 and 6.7-inch for the S21+) with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz (LTPS panel). The screen of the smartphone is covered with Gorilla Glass Victus, while its back is covered with plastic for economic reasons. Samsung did the same with the S20 FE and S21, and to our surprise, it didn't bother us at all. So we are not at all worried about this aspect.

Also to discover the video:

Available in four colors (oDirect, Lavender, Graphite, White), Galaxy S21 FE comes with a 4500mAh high capacity battery and supports 25W wired charging and 15W wireless charging (but the charger is not in the box). Its design is similar to that of the classic S21 with one exception: its camera module is the same color as the back.

On the photo side, the triple camera module on the S21 FE is similar, if not better, to the one on the S21. On the back we find the same main sensor (12 MP, f / 1.8, dual pixel), the same ultra-wide angle (12 MP, f / 2.2) and this is a difference, a real telephoto lens with x3 optical zoom (8 Mpix, f / 2.4). The traditional S21s used a 64 Mpix sensor and were content with digital zoom. 8K recording sacrificed, but is it flaw ?

The best Samsung around?

At €759, the Galaxy S21 FE stands a good chance of becoming Samsung's best smartphone if it performs well. With an average size between the S21 and S21 +, a better processor and a lighter weight (170 grams) thanks to its plastic back, the new Korean device is very interesting. However, one wonders if the S22's range won't outlast it quickly.","{'uri': 'vaughantoday.ca', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Vaughan Today'}","[{'uri': 'jillian_castillo@vaughantoday.ca', 'name': 'Jillian Castillo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.vaughantoday.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Samsung-unveils-Galaxy-S21-FE-the-perfect-smartphone-for-Christmas.png,0.03529411764705892,eng-7377109,False,0.8666666746139526,0.03529411764705892,378985200,2

Today it's time to talk about a new model that has just been leaked and that doesn't make any sense. This is the Motorola One Vision Plus. If we pay attention to the name, this device would come to replace the One Vision launched last year, something that may make sense. The reality is that it arrives with meaningless hardware, with hardly any changes and repeating one of the company's biggest problems. Yes, we are talking about the choice of the processor.

The device has been leaked from several different sources, so it looks official and should be released shortly. If we take a look at the characteristics of the device it does not make much sense, because it is not a real advance over the original One Vision. Motorola has wanted to launch a new device with the same base and slight changes that contribute little or nothing.

We don't know the design, but the list of features is completed with a 6.3-inch screen, 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of storage, NFC support and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor. These are all the features that have been leaked about One Vision Plus.

What are the differences from the original One Vision? The Qualcomm processor! The One Vision was introduced with an Exynos 9609, a standard mid-range processor without much fanfare. The most curious thing is that the new One Vision Plus has gone through Geekbench and its results in the benchmark are not better than those of the original model, that is, it does not represent a jump in performance. It is even below some tests of the original One Vision.

This lets us know that Motorola has included a 'Plus' in the name without improving the screen, without improving the RAM, without improving the storage and without improving the processor. This component has only changed the manufacturer, but will not be a real improvement for the user. It remains only to wait to see if the new One Vision Plus has a more advanced camera system or design improvements.

Motorola is going through one of the worst moments in its history, something that does not surprise us too much by following these types of strategies. Its mid-range devices are more expensive and less powerful than those of most of its competing manufacturers. This only leaves them a place in markets where brands such as realme or Xiaomi have not yet arrived.

In terms of specifications, the Moto G71 5G comes with a 6.4-inch Full-HD+ (1,080×2,400 pixels) OLED display with a refresh rate of 60Hz that could be a bit disappointing as most competitors in this range now offer at least a 90Hz screen.

OnePlus has not shared any details about the smartphone apart from the few teaser images that show two colour options coming on the next OnePlus flagship.

Two colour options that the OnePlus 10 Pro will be launched in have been showcased - Volcanic Black and Forest Emerald. The photos of the smartphone show that the OnePlus 10 Pro will keep the company's alert slider - a design bit that has been a distinguishing feature from the brand. The camera module, however, seems like a bold approach from OnePlus. The module is more square this time around than rectangle as on the OnePlus 9 Pro. It also merges into the frame of the OnePlus 10 Pro, which makes it appear to be floating on the top corner of the back panel.

The images show that the OnePlus 10 Pro has a triple rear camera setup. The specifications of the OnePlus 10 Pro have not been revealed yet, but the triple camera module is expected to come with one wide, one ultra-wide, and one telephoto lens. The images shared by the company also show that the smartphone will not come with a periscope lens for enhanced zoom.

Now, OnePlus has not shared any details about the smartphone except these few teaser images. The company is expected to unveil more as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2022 commences.

In terms of specifications, the OnePlus 10 Pro is expected to come with a 120Hz display, and may be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset paired with up to 12GB of RAM.

CES 2022 runs from January 5-8 and will showcase the hottest new products from around the world.

It's featuring established brands like Samsung, LG, Sony, Qualcomm and Panasonic, plus a bunch of newcomers.

This year's conference will include products with 5G connectivity, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, robotics and more.

You can catch all the announcements live as they happen on the CES YouTube channel.

And while we're still waiting for the big news to drop, there has already been a slew of new tech announced.

Samsung drops thunderbolt

Samsung has kicked off CES with a bang, announcing its new flagship -- the Galaxy S21 FE.

The phone is a renewed push into the mid-range market, retailing for $999 from January 11.

There's a sweetener on offer too. Customers who buy from participating retailers before January 30 will get a bonus pair of Galaxy Buds2 valued at $219.

You can also receive up to $300 off the price if you trade-in your old device.

It has the classic Galaxy specs: a fast processor and a 4500mAh battery with fast 25W charging.

It's got 12MP ultra-wide, 12MP wide and 8MP telephoto cameras. There's a whopping 32MP selfie camera.

The S21 FE runs Android 12 with OneUI 4 and has a 6.4-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display and boasts a 240Hz touch sampling rate in game mode.

You can get 6GB RAM with 128GB or 8GB RAM with 256GB.

The S21 FE has a stylish design - a sleek look and a slim 7.9mm-thick body. It comes in olive, lavender, white and graphite.

Samsung has also promised an ""extraordinary surprise"" at CES, which it teased with a video showing aliens going about mysterious tasks behind a frosted window.

LG TVs

LG today announced the new LG 2022 OLED TVs and they're proof TVs are getting smarter by the day.

The hi-tech TVs employ self-lighting pixels that can be turned on and off individually to ""deliver perfect blacks, natural colours and infinite contrast"".

The LG 2022 G2 series introduces a new 83-inch model and the world's first 97-inch OLED model. That's one enormous TV.

You can check out more LG announcements and products at the virtual booth here.

CES is already handing out honoree awards for some pretty cool tech and I've listed some of the best.

Motion Pillow 3

The Motion Pillow 3 senses the user's head position and detects the sound of snoring, which triggers the airbags inside the pillow. The airbag inflates to optimise the sleeper's head position without disturbing sleep. I can hear my wife ordering one already.

Abbott I-STAT TBI Plasma

The Abbott I-STAT TBI Plasma is one of the new incredible health products coming on the market.

It provides the first rapid handheld traumatic brain injury test. Tests results are available within 15 minutes. A negative result can be used to rule out the need for head CT scan, freeing up valuable hospital space.

It displays imagery with high contrast, ensuring that both dark and light details are rendered perfectly -- excellent for a game of Doom or Diablo II Resurrected.

Just take a picture of your pets' eyes or any part of their body with a mobile phone and artificial intelligence will inform you whether or not there are any eye or skin disease-related symptoms.

That can help with preventive diagnosis and treatment - a very cool way to use AI tech.

SOUNDFORM Immerse Noise Cancelling Earbuds

The SOUNDFORM Immerse Noise Cancelling Earbuds are high-fidelity earbuds with Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation.

I reviewed the Belkin Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds last year and gave them the tick of approval.

NexusTouch

The NexusTouch by Boréas Technologies is the kind of tech that, once you see it, you wonder why it wasn't invented already.

It's a virtual-button design platform that expands touch-based user interfaces on the sides of smartphones and gaming phones.

Immersive trigger effects make gaming phones feel more like gaming consoles -- without the clunky mechanical toggles.

AI Studios

Watch out video producers, AI is coming for your job (and everyone else's too).

The new AI Studios by DeepBrain AI is a video production tool that makes it easy to produce videos without the need to film or employ the real people.

You can eliminate costly studio, lighting, camera, set-staff, and even the video host.

Just type the script and that enables the AI anchor to naturally speak, use body language and gestures just like a real presenter. Freaky stuff.

Solar inspection solution by hydrogen fuel cell drone

This new Doosan drone has a hydrogen fuel cell, meaning it is eco-friendly and can fly for 2+ hours with automatic mission flight.

Plus it looks like a spider.

In a single flight, it is possible to take detailed shots of hundreds of thousands of solar panels.

Saving the planet and looking cool all at the same time.

MP100 Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Portable bluetooth speakers are a dime a dozen these days, but the Edifier MP100 Plus stands out for being quite fashionable.

It has lightweight casing made from durable waterproof fabric and sturdy TPU material that achieves the water-resistant grade of IPX7. So good if you like the rough and tumble.

STARcase

The STARcase is an innovative, app-controlled cellular phone case. It allows you to display customised notifications on a LED display for calls, texts, emails, and third-party apps.

You can choose from hundreds of light shows, animated icons, and customisable scrolling text to view messages and notifications.

I'm a sucker for bright lights and would definitely buy this.

The Kinoo App

The Kinoo App is a new video communication platform that uses augmented reality and virtual activities to bring families closer together.

This is great new way for old and young people to connect during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Anything that can bring families together at this time is a winner in my book.

But the best thing about it is that it just looks damn cool.

It's also made specifically for gamers. No more lag!

Galaxy Z Fold3

It's not CES without the latest in phone technology.

Flip phones are making a comeback (hello 1990s?) in a big way this year.

The Galaxy Z Fold3 is Samsung's most advanced and durable foldable yet.

It has IPX8 water resistance, an Under Display Camera, and first-ever S Pen support on a foldable, all on a 7.6"" screen.

Sony BRAVIA CAM for TV

The Sony BRAVIA CAM for TV by Sony is a camera device equipped with a recognition engine transforms the TV viewing experience in the living room.

A camera on a TV - that's a new one for me.

A peron's location in front of the TV is analysed by skeleton estimation and face detection, which is calculated only in a private and securely protected memory bank.

The processor then optimises picture and sound quality according to the your viewing environment.

The phone has quick speeds, faster streaming, speedy downloads, and enhanced AI features with its Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.

Almost all tech is wearable these days. But what about a jewel that could save your life?

MyEli is an aesthetic and secure connected jewel, which allows a person to alert emergency contacts in case of imminent danger.

Connected to the smartphone via Bluetooth, it is linked to a 100 per cent customisable mobile application that allows several simultaneous actions to be set up if a person feels threatened.

This is particularly good for women who might feel vulnerable walking alone at night.

In a post on Weibo, the CEO of OnePlus, which is under another Chinese tech giant Oppo, Pete Lau, said that its next flagship will be unveiled by January 2022.

On top of that, the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G is launching on January 11, at least in China. It is to note that the Chinese tech giant has yet to announce any details for its global release.

Nevertheless, The Verge added in the same report that 91 Mobiles has previously predicted that the OnePlus 10 is set to release globally sometime in April.

The Motion Pillow 3 senses the user's head position and detects the sound of snoring, which triggers the airbags inside the pillow. The airbag inflates to optimise the sleeper's head position without disturbing sleep. I can hear my wife ordering one already.

Abbott I-STAT TBI Plasma

The Abbott I-STAT TBI Plasma is one of the new incredible health products coming on the market.

It provides the first rapid handheld traumatic brain injury test. Tests results are available within 15 minutes. A negative result can be used to rule out the need for head CT scan, freeing up valuable hospital space.

It displays imagery with high contrast, ensuring that both dark and light details are rendered perfectly -- excellent for a game of Doom or Diablo II Resurrected.

Just take a picture of your pets' eyes or any part of their body with a mobile phone and artificial intelligence will inform you whether or not there are any eye or skin disease-related symptoms.

That can help with preventive diagnosis and treatment - a very cool way to use AI tech.

SOUNDFORM Immerse Noise Cancelling Earbuds

The SOUNDFORM Immerse Noise Cancelling Earbuds are high-fidelity earbuds with Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation.

I reviewed the Belkin Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds last year and gave them the tick of approval.

NexusTouch

The NexusTouch by Boréas Technologies is the kind of tech that, once you see it, you wonder why it wasn't invented already.

It's a virtual-button design platform that expands touch-based user interfaces on the sides of smartphones and gaming phones.

Immersive trigger effects make gaming phones feel more like gaming consoles -- without the clunky mechanical toggles.

AI Studios

Watch out video producers, AI is coming for your job (and everyone else's too).

The new AI Studios by DeepBrain AI is a video production tool that makes it easy to produce videos without the need to film or employ the real people.

You can eliminate costly studio, lighting, camera, set-staff, and even the video host.

Just type the script and that enables the AI anchor to naturally speak, use body language and gestures just like a real presenter. Freaky stuff.

Solar inspection solution by hydrogen fuel cell drone

This new Doosan drone has a hydrogen fuel cell, meaning it is eco-friendly and can fly for 2+ hours with automatic mission flight.

Plus it looks like a spider.

In a single flight, it is possible to take detailed shots of hundreds of thousands of solar panels.

Saving the planet and looking cool all at the same time.

MP100 Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Portable bluetooth speakers are a dime a dozen these days, but the Edifier MP100 Plus stands out for being quite fashionable.

It has lightweight casing made from durable waterproof fabric and sturdy TPU material that achieves the water-resistant grade of IPX7. So good if you like the rough and tumble.

STARcase

The STARcase is an innovative, app-controlled cellular phone case. It allows you to display customised notifications on a LED display for calls, texts, emails, and third-party apps.

You can choose from hundreds of light shows, animated icons, and customisable scrolling text to view messages and notifications.

I'm a sucker for bright lights and would definitely buy this.

The Kinoo App

The Kinoo App is a new video communication platform that uses augmented reality and virtual activities to bring families closer together.

This is great new way for old and young people to connect during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Anything that can bring families together at this time is a winner in my book.

But the best thing about it is that it just looks damn cool.

It's also made specifically for gamers. No more lag!

Galaxy Z Fold3

It's not CES without the latest in phone technology.

Flip phones are making a comeback (hello 1990s?) in a big way this year.

The Galaxy Z Fold3 is Samsung's most advanced and durable foldable yet.

It has IPX8 water resistance, an Under Display Camera, and first-ever S Pen support on a foldable, all on a 7.6"" screen.

Sony BRAVIA CAM for TV

The Sony BRAVIA CAM for TV by Sony is a camera device equipped with a recognition engine transforms the TV viewing experience in the living room.

A camera on a TV - that's a new one for me.

A peron's location in front of the TV is analysed by skeleton estimation and face detection, which is calculated only in a private and securely protected memory bank.

The processor then optimises picture and sound quality according to the your viewing environment.

The phone has quick speeds, faster streaming, speedy downloads, and enhanced AI features with its Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.

Almost all tech is wearable these days. But what about a jewel that could save your life?

MyEli is an aesthetic and secure connected jewel, which allows a person to alert emergency contacts in case of imminent danger.

Connected to the smartphone via Bluetooth, it is linked to a 100 per cent customisable mobile application that allows several simultaneous actions to be set up if a person feels threatened.

This is particularly good for women who might feel vulnerable walking alone at night.

Alibaba says for now, it has no plans to sell the chip to outsiders.

Other rookie chip developers including Tencent, a games and social media giant, and smartphone brand Xiaomi are pledging billions of dollars in line with official plans to create computing, clean energy and other technology that can build China's wealth and global influence.

Processor chips play an increasingly critical role in products from smartphones and cars to medical devices and home appliances. Shortages due to the coronavirus pandemic are disrupting global manufacturing and adding to worries about supplies.

Chips are a top priority in the ruling Communist Party's marathon campaign to end China's reliance on technology from the United States, Japan and other suppliers Beijing sees as potential economic and strategic rivals. If it succeeds, business and political leaders warn that might slow down innovation, disrupt global trade and make the world poorer.

''Self-reliance is the foundation for the Chinese nation,'' President Xi Jinping said in a speech released in March. He called for China to become a ''technology superpower'' to safeguard ''national economic security.''

''We must strive to become the world's main center of science and the high ground of innovation,'' Xi said.

Beijing might be chasing a costly disappointment. Even with huge official investments, businesspeople and analysts say chipmakers and other companies will struggle to compete if they detach from global suppliers of advanced components and technology ,a goal no other country is pursuing.

''It's hard to imagine any one country rebuilding all of that and having the best technology,'' said Peter Hanbury, who follows the industry for Bain & Co.

Beijing's campaign is adding to tension with Washington and Europe, which see China as a strategic competitor and complain it steals technology. They limit access to tools needed to improve its industries.

If the world were to decouple, or split into markets with incompatible standards and products, US or European-made parts might not work in Chinese computers or cars. Smartphone makers who have a single dominant global operating system and two network standards might need to make unique versions for different markets. That could slow down development.

Washington and Beijing need to ''avoid that the world becomes separated,'' UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told The Associated Press in September.

China's factories assemble the world's smartphones and tablet computers but need components from the United States, Europe, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Chips are China's biggest import, ahead of crude oil, at more than $300 billion last year.

Official urgency over that grew after Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, lost access to U.S. chips and other technology in 2018 under sanctions imposed by the White House.

That crippled the telecom equipment maker's ambition to be a leader in next-generation smartphones. American officials say Huawei is a security risk and might aid Chinese spying, an accusation the company denies.

Huawei and some Chinese rivals are close to matching Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc., South Korea's Samsung Electronics and Britain's Arm Ltd. at being able to design ''bleeding edge'' logic chips for smartphones, according to industry analysts.

But when it comes to making them, foundries such as state-owned SMIC in Shanghai are up to a decade behind industry leaders including TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., which produces chips for Apple Inc. and other global brands.

Even companies such as Alibaba that can design chips likely will need Taiwanese or other foreign foundries to make them. Alibaba's Yitian 710 requires precision no Chinese foundry can achieve. The company declined to say which foreign producer it will use.

''My country still faces a big gap in chip technology,'' said industry analyst Liu Chuntian of Zero Power Intelligence Group.

China accounts for 23% of global chip production capacity but only 7.6% of sales.

Packing millions of transistors onto a fingernail-size sliver of silicon requires some 1,500 steps, microscopic precision and arcane technologies owned by a handful of US, European, Japanese and other suppliers.

They include KLA Corp. in California for super-precise measurement and Japan's TEL for machines to apply coatings a few molecules thick. Many are covered by restrictions on ''dual use'' technologies that can be used in weapons.

China ''lags significantly'' in tools, materials and production technology, the Semiconductor Industry Association said in a report this year.

Washington and Europe, citing security worries, block access to the most advanced tools Chinese chipmakers need to match global leaders in precision and efficiency.

Without those, China is falling farther behind, said Bain's Hanbury.

''The TSMC horse is sprinting away and the Chinese horse is stopped,'' he said. ''They can't move forward.''

Washington stepped up pressure on Huawei last year by barring global foundries from using American technology to produce its chips. U.S. vendors can sell chips to the company, but not for next-generation ''5G'' smartphones.

For its part, the European Union said it will review foreign investments after complaints China was eroding Europe's technology lead by purchasing important assets such as German robot maker Kuka.

Alibaba's Yitian 710 is based on architecture from Britain's Arm, highlighting China's enduring need for foreign know-how. Alibaba said it still will work closely with longtime foreign suppliers Intel, Arm, Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

T-Head's first chip, the Hanguang 800, was announced in 2019 for artificial intelligence. Its second, the XuanTie 910, is for self-driving cars and other functions.

In November, Tencent Holding, which operates the WeChat messaging service, announced its first three chips for artificial intelligence, cloud computing and video.

Beijing says it will spend $150 billion from 2014 through 2030 to develop its chip industry, but even that is a fraction of what global leaders invest. TSMC plans to spend $100 billion in the next three years on research and manufacturing.

China is trying to buy experience by hiring engineers from TSMC and other Taiwanese producers. Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory and has threatened to attack, has responded by imposing curbs on job advertising.

Beijing encourages smartphone and other manufacturers to use suppliers within China, even if they cost more, but officials deny China wants to detach from global industries.

''We will never go back in history by seeking to decouple,'' Xi said in a speech by video link to a November meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia.

The latest conflict is over photolithography, which uses ultraviolet light to etch circuits into silicon on a scale measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter.

The leader is ASML in the Netherlands, which makes machines that can etch transistors just 5 nanometers apart. That would pack 2 million into a space one centimeter wide.

China's SMIC is about one-third as precise at 14 nanometers. Taiwan's TSMC is preparing to increase its precision to 2 nanometers.

SMIC wants to upgrade by purchasing ASML's latest machine, but the Dutch government has yet to agree.

''We will wait for their decision,'' said an ASML spokeswoman, Monica Mols, in an email.","{'uri': 'english.ahram.org.eg', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'جريدة الأهرام'}",[],https://english.ahram.org.eg/Media/News/2021/12/28/41_2021-637762847406854541-685.jpg,0.1450980392156862,,False,0,0.1450980392156862,378982020,1

However, usually most of these devices that are announced are budget-friendly or mid-tier devices, as most companies prefer to host their own events to launch flagships phones. The rest of the show is usually reserved for new concepts, auto tech and televisions (among a litany of smaller sub-industries). This year, OnePlus has decided to reveal its latest flagship while CES 2022 is running, the OnePlus 10 Pro.

While OnePlus hasn't yet revealed all details about the first flagship to launch in 2022, we can piece together the missing information from other leaks and rumours. We know the OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch display with the high refresh rates, pegged at 120Hz. It will also be the first phone in the world to launch with the latest and greatest from Qualcomm, the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset.

We don't know much about the camera array yet, to be expected at OnePlus' official launch event. The OnePlus 10 Pro has an interesting camera bump (very reminiscent of the design of the Samsung Galaxy S21 range), which houses three cameras and a fourth flash ring. The flash has P2D 50T written in the middle of the ring, but we have no information about what that might mean.

OnePlus has often been criticised for sub-par camera performance on its recent flagships, as prices have increased and it now competes with the big boys in the industry. The camera array may be make or break for the OnePlus 10 Pro, depending on where it is priced. It certainly looks like a premium device, so we expect it to be priced similarly to its prior flagships.","{'uri': 'bandwidthblog.co.za', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bandwidth Blog'}",[],https://bandwidthblog.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oneplus-10-pro.jpg,0.03529411764705892,eng-7376935,False,0.7058823704719543,0.03529411764705892,378979320,1

In 2020, Samsung did something pretty interesting with the Galaxy S20 series. After launching the S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra in March 2020, it released the S20 FE that October. The S20 FE had almost all the same specs as the regular S20, save for a $200 cheaper MSRP. It launched at the right time, had the right price, and was an instant hit among fans and critics alike.

Then came the Galaxy S21 lineup. The S21, S21+, and S21 Ultra all debuted in January 2021. Rumors of a Galaxy S21 FE circulated for months and months. However, it wasn't until a year later in January 2022 that the phone actually came out. The Galaxy S21 FE touts a nearly identical design to the S21, costs $699, and has many of the same specs as the flagship phone it's mimicking.

Starting with the design, Samsung confirms that the Galaxy S21 FE has a plastic body with dimensions of 74.5 x 155.7 x 7.9mm. It also weighs 177g, making it slightly heavier than the 'normal' S21. On the front of the S21 FE is a 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED display. It packs a Full HD+ resolution of 2340 x 1080, along with a 'Super Smooth' 120Hz refresh rate. Accompanying the screen are stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support, but just like the S20 FE, there is no 3.5mm headphone jack.

More Galaxy S21 FE Specifications

The Galaxy S21 FE features three cameras on its back: A 12MP primary camera with OIS, a 12MP ultra-wide camera with a 123° FoV, and an 8MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom + 30x Space Zoom. Rounding out the camera system is a 32MP selfie camera, which rests in a small hole-punch cutout in the top center of the display.

Then there are all of the internal specifications. Powering the S21 FE is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor. It's the same chip found in the other S21 handsets, though it has since been replaced by the more capable Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. Joining that is a choice between 6 or 8GB of RAM, 128 or 256GB of storage, and a 4500 mAh battery. Samsung has ample charging options to choose from -- including 25W wired charging and 15W wireless charging. There's also support for Wireless PowerShare, so the S21 FE can wirelessly charge other devices, too.

And, last but not least, there are all of the miscellaneous tidbits. Samsung Pay support is here, though only for NFC transactions and not MST ones. The S21 FE also has an optical fingerprint sensor underneath its display, an IP68 dust/water resistance rating, launches with Android 12, and has and support for both sub-6 and mmWave 5G. In short, it's a pretty solid overall package. The timing and pricing for the Galaxy S21 FE takes away from the excitement a bit, but looking purely at the spec sheet, Samsung made a lot of good decisions.

The Realme GT 2 series will be launched in China at 7:30 pm CST Asia (5 pm IST). The event will be aired live on the company's China website and Weibo.

In typical OnePlus fashion, the Chinese brand has started hyping its next gen flagship phone - OnePlus 10 Pro - ahead of launch with founder (also chief product officer at Oppo) Pete Lau promising ""multiple upgrades."" There is no mention of the vanilla OnePlus 10, at this point, but OnePlus looks all set to launch the OnePlus 10 Pro in China on January 11. The phone should arrive in global markets soon enough.

The OnePlus 10 Pro design has been part of rumour mills since November last year, and a set of promotional images shared by OnePlus days ahead of launch confirm, all the leaks were spot-on. The phone will, indeed, have a camera array heavily inspired from the Samsung Galaxy S21 series. Samsung calls it ""contour cut"" wherein the rear cameras are basically integrated with the frame so as to give the phone a more seamless look. This is, also, a useful workaround to make its camera bump somewhat more bearable.

Ironically, Samsung seems to have given up on its contour cut design, already, as the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S22 series is expected to come with a more conventional camera array with sensors stacked individually rather than being part of a raised platform. All this despite the fact that the Galaxy S21 Ultra design has been quite popular among fans and critics. Whether or not OnePlus is able to do any justice to a familiar design, remains to be seen.

But moving on, rest of the OnePlus 10 Pro should be on expected lines. OnePlus isn't showing the phone from the front, yet, but it will likely look more or less similar to the OnePlus 9 Pro with a fast AMOLED panel and hole punch cut-out. OnePlus has confirmed the OnePlus 10 Pro will come in green and black, at least. It will have three camera sensors on the back.

The phone is expected to be powered by Qualcomm's top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip while retaining OnePlus's partnership with Hasselblad.

Last month we saw OPPO dabble into the foldable sphere with the launch of the Find N. Now one more player will soon be bringing its own take on the foldable form factor. The Chinese smartphone maker Honor has been teasing its upcoming Magic V smartphone for the past few weeks. Today the company officially revealed the launch date for its first foldable phone.

In a press release today, Honor confirmed it will unveil the Magic V on January 10. The launch event will take place in China at 11:30 AM UTC. While Honor didn't detail anything about the hardware, the accompanying teaser shared by the company gives us a glimpse of the phone's design. As you can see in the image below, the Honor Magic V will sport a triple camera setup on the back nestled inside a rectangular module. We can also see the outer display with a centered hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera.

As seen in last month's teaser, the Honor Magic V will sport an inward folding design similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and feature flat edges. The phone will most likely be powered by Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. Similar to previous Honor smartphones, the Honor Magic V will be limited to the Chinese market, at least initially. The company hasn't confirmed whether the phone will make its way to international markets. The Honor Magic V will go head to head against the likes of the OPPO Find N, Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Huawei Mate X2.

Not much is known about the Honor Magic V's internal hardware at this point. But with the official launch just a week away, we won't have to wait long to learn more about Honor's first foldable smartphone.","{'uri': 'xda-developers.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'XDA-Developers'}","[{'uri': 'kishan_vyas@xda-developers.com', 'name': 'Kishan Vyas', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/01/Magic-V-annoucement.jpg,0.3019607843137255,eng-7381945,False,0.8509804010391235,0.3019607843137255,378976680,1

Samsung's Galaxy S21 FE is finally heading to the Philippines, months after its expected August release. As expected the phone brings Samsung's special flagship sauce to a more palatable price point, though Samsung has obviously cut a few features to make that possible.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE comes in a myriad of colorways, including black, silver, lavender, and olive, the former being our review unit. And just like the original FE, the S21 FE is still clad in that soft, matte plastic chassis that makes it feel nice to the touch.

While the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE doesn't have the same pomp in its design as its more expensive brother, it's still a nice phone to hold in the hands. The plastic back doesn't feel or look cheap - in fact, I prefer its soft-touch finish over the regular Galaxy S21.

The frame of the phone is still metal (aluminum actually) and it still has IP68 protection like its more expensive brothers. The power and volume buttons are on the right side of the phone, while the USB Type-C port and single speaker grille are located on the bottom.

Samsung makes phones with great displays, and the S21 FE is no exception. The display is a tad smaller than the S20 FE, coming in at just 6.4-inches diagonal, though the resolution is the same: 2,340 x 1,080. The phone has a 120Hz refresh rate and a 240Hz touch sample rate, and you can switch between 60Hz and 120Hz depending on your preference. A halo cut out on the top of the display houses the 32-megapixel selfie camera.

As for the actual screen quality, it's typical Samsung, meaning the display looks very, very good. We haven't come across a Super AMOLED display from Samsung that we didn't like, and the one in the Galaxy S21 FE is no exception. The colors look great, black levels are spot on - all the hallmarks of a great Samsung flagship.

The phone has an in-display fingerprint scanner that's responsive enough, though it's not quite as quick as the one on the regular S21. I wouldn't have minded if Samsung used a side-mounted fingerprint scanner either since I'm so used to flagships using that unlock method.

The optics on the Galaxy S21 FE are borrowed from its more expensive brother. Essentially, you're looking at a 12-megapixel main shooter with dual pixel AF and OIS, along with an f/1.8 aperture lens, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with an f/2.2 aperture lens, and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera with an f/2.4 aperture lens.

We haven't taken the phone out to play yet to test it out for photos, but its triple camera arrangement is identical to the S21, so it's not too far off the mark to say that you should expect the same kind of image quality as the more expensive flagship.

Just like the Galaxy S21, the Galaxy S21 FE will come in two processor variants: Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 for western markets like the US, and Samsung's Exynos 2100 processor for the rest of the world, including the Philippines. The phone will have 8GB of RAM and will be offered in two storage options: 128GB and 256GB.

Obviously, some people will be disappointed that the phone doesn't get Qualcomm's top-end chip, and that's understandable. That being said, the phone doesn't feel slow at all and gets really good marks in our benchmark tests. Yes, it falls behind the Snapdragon 888, but in actual use, you really won't even notice.

As far as software goes, the phone is one of the first Samsung devices to ship with Android 12 along with One UI 4 from the box. The phone feels quick and is relatively free from bloatware as long as you make sure to uncheck all the ""suggested"" items Samsung wants you to install at the beginning.

Battery-wise you're not looking at a lot - there's 4500mAh on tap, which should be enough but is a bit short of the usual 5000mAh we see on flagship devices. It should last you the whole day, though we'll have to do our usual battery rundown to see how far the battery goes.

As for charging speeds, you're stuck at a 25W - fast charging according to Samsung - and 15W for wireless charging.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE looks to be a great phone in our short review of it for the Philippines, though its late arrival put it at a weird junction. While it looks to be great value on paper (especially at its price point), Samsung's rivals are already prepping challengers for the new phone, though if you're on the lookout for a solid, no-frills flagship, the Galaxy S21 FE should be in your shortlist.

The Galaxy S21 FE has a price of Php 38,990 for the 8GB/128GB model and Php 41,990 for the 8GB/256GB model in the Philippines. Those pre-ordering until January 10 will get the Galaxy Buds Live with their purchase.","{'uri': 'unbox.ph', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'UNBOX PH'}",[],http://unbox.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-Review-01-scaled.jpg,0.2862745098039217,eng-7377109,False,0.843137264251709,0.2862745098039217,378976320,2

The rollout of this update is dependent on the OEM as well as the country and region. It looks like users of the Nokia G50 are now getting their Android 12 update, that is if they live in Finland. There is no official announcement from HMD Global just yet so this may just be the initial phase for OTA updates.

Nokia normally pushes out these major Android updates in phases, with a smaller number of users receiving it first and then slowly growing the subset until everyone gets it. They already previously did this with the Nokia X10 last December and now it looks like the Nokia G50 is getting it. Well, at least a small group of users in Finland seem to be getting the Android 12 update based on a post in the community thread on the Nokia website.

The Nokia G50 is the direct successor to the Nokia G20. It launched with Android 11 last September and Nokia said it will be receiving two major upgrades and three years of security patches. This is its first update since its launch. It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 chipset and has a 6.82-inch LCD panel and 4GB of RAM. It seems that Android 12 is rolling out in Finland only for now although the device is available in the U.S and other countries in Europe.

The Android 12 update will bring several changes to Android smartphones including a new and more rounded user interface, larger quick toggles, conversation widgets, accessibility improvements, etc. The Material You UI will not be available for non-Pixel devices just yet but we may eventually just get it. The update, version V2.160 also seems to carry the November 2021 security patches as we can expect the December one to come early this January.

As for the other Android smartphones that are supposed to get the Android 12 update, we'll be reporting which ones are officially announced and also which ones users say they got already. Just remember that we have to be patient when it comes to things like this as they usually take weeks and months to roll out.","{'uri': 'androidcommunity.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Community'}",[],https://androidcommunity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/nokia_G50-DTC-VIDEO-desktop.jpg?w=640,0.192156862745098,eng-7379423,False,0.7960784435272217,0.192156862745098,378973680,1

iQOO, Vivo's high performance sub brand, in the past has confirmed the display specifications as well as details in relation to the two upcoming devices in the iQOO 9 series, the iQOO 9 and iQOO 9 Pro. The two smartphones will launch on January 5 in China.

Both the smartphones have been officially listed on China's one of the leading e-commerce platforms JD.com

Both the iQOO 9 and 9 Pro are expected to launch in India also, with rumours hinting at a launch date of next month. Now MySmartPrice, in collaboration with famed tipster Ishan Agarwal has revealed the complete specification sheet of both flagship handsets.

The company will launch its new flagship smartphones on January 5. Starting with the Pro model, the phone will come with a 6.78-inch AMOLED 2K 120Hz E5 AMOLED screen of LTPO 2.0 type with 517 PPI pixel density, 1,500 nits peak brightness, and 1,000Hz touch sampling rate.

The iQOO 9 series will include a 50 megapixel primary camera with gimbal stabilisation. The iQOO 9 Pro would include an ultrawide lens with a 150-degree field of view. The standard iQOO 9 variant, on the other hand, is expected to come with a 50 megapixel Samsung GN5 primary camera, a 13 megapixel ultrawide camera with a 120-degree FOV, and a 12 megapixel Sony IMX663 telephoto camera sensor.

According to the company, iQOO 9 will be the first smartphone series ever to feature Samsung's 50MP GN5 sensor. It will measure 164.8mm×75.2mm×8.8mm/ 9.2mm depending on the variant.

The smartphone will weigh about 204 grams and 210 grams for both variants, which includes the BMW Motorrad Edition.

Under the hood, the phones will feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen1 SoCs paired with an enhanced version of 12 GB LPDDR5 RAM and an overclocking version of UFS 3.1 storage. Both phones will also sport a VC three-dimensional heat dissipation system.

Both phones are said to pack 4,700mAh batteries with support for 120W fast charging, 50W wireless charging, and 10W reverse charging. The smartphones will run the latest Android 12 operating system out-of-the-box.","{'uri': 'indiatoday.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'India Today'}","[{'uri': 'akarsh_verma@indiatoday.in', 'name': 'Akarsh Verma', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202201/iQOO_9_Pro-647x363.jpeg?7u8Hsl7vk9AZmorUgdVwQgs6rfLyUtwk,0.1764705882352942,eng-7379035,False,0.8627451062202454,0.1764705882352942,378970560,1

Samsung is once again launching a more affordable version of its popular Galaxy S phone with the Galaxy S21 FE, which starts at $700 and launches on Jan. 11 following its CES 2022 reveal. It's $100 cheaper than the regular Galaxy S21 and comes with a larger screen, the same processor, a triple-lens camera and support for both flavors of 5G. I've only spent a couple of days with the Galaxy S21 FE, but it seems to check all the boxes most people would expect from a modern phone. The performance is snappy, it takes great photos and the battery life is fairly impressive so far.

Load Error

These attributes make the Galaxy S21 FE a promising option if you want a relatively affordable new Android 12 device. You won't get some of the costly extras found on more premium phones -- like a fourth camera lens, a crisper telephoto lens or a super sophisticated design -- but you're also not compromising by going for Samsung's cheaper option.

At the same time, the Galaxy S21 FE may end up feeling lost in Samsung's lineup and the broader Android phone market. We're expecting the Galaxy S22 to launch imminently, and if the rumors are true, it could have a new 50-megapixel camera and faster charging. Plus, the $600 Pixel 6 is slightly cheaper than the Galaxy S21 FE and was named one of our favorite phones of 2021.

We'll be updating this story as we spend more time using the Galaxy S21 FE, but here are my impressions so far.

The Galaxy S21 FE looks almost identical to the Galaxy S21 from the front. It measures 7.9 millimeters thin just like the standard Galaxy S21, despite the fact that it has a larger screen. For me, the S21 FE's 6.4-inch display and light build provide the right balance of screen space and ease of use: It's bigger than the 6.2-inch Galaxy S21 but just a hair smaller than the 6.5-inch Galaxy S20 FE, Samsung's previous-generation midrange phone.

The Galaxy S21 FE's screen uses Samsung's Dynamic AMOLED technology and has an FHD+ resolution just like the Galaxy S21. The pixel density, or number of pixels per inch, is lower than the Galaxy S21's since the S21 FE's screen is larger, but the difference isn't noticeable. Photos, games and news articles all look sharp and bold on the S21 FE's screen. It has a flat edge screen just like the Galaxy 21 and Galaxy S1 Plus, which I actually prefer over the pricier Galaxy S21 Ultra's slightly curved sides.

On the back, you'll find the same camera bump as the Galaxy S21. Both phones also have a matte finish that looks more elegant and doesn't pick up fingerprints as easily as Samsung's older phones (although it still does get smudgy, so you'll want to use a case). The Galaxy S21, however, does have some design accents that make it feel like a more expensive phone, such as the glossy metallic finish on its camera module and sides.

Samsung's Galaxy S21 FE looks almost exactly like the Galaxy S21

Though it's a nice enough phone for $700, the real problem is that Google has raised the bar for what's expected of a midtier phone. Google's $600 Pixel 6 has a gorgeous, two-tone glass design that makes it feel much more expensive than it actually is. The Galaxy S21 FE is sleek and light, but it doesn't leave the same impression.

There's also an in-screen fingerprint reader and facial authentication for unlocking the device, which I generally found to be pretty reliable. You won't find expandable storage on this model as was the case with the Galaxy S20 FE, but Samsung is selling its new phone in another variant that comes with 256GB of storage (the base model has 128GB).

Battery life was a highlight for the Galaxy S20 FE, and the Galaxy S21 FE seems to follow in its footsteps so far. Like the Galaxy S20 FE, the Galaxy S21 FE comes with a 4,500 mAh battery, which is larger than the regular Galaxy S21's 4,000 mAh battery.

The Galaxy S21 FE still had 32% of its battery left after a full day and a half's worth of usage. That's not too shabby, especially since I had the motion smoothness setting on high, which cranks the screen's refresh rate up to 120Hz. That results in faster scrolling but also typically means shorter battery life.

Samsung's new phone comes with the same processor as the Galaxy S21, which means the US version runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. That chip is found in other high-end phones like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the OnePlus 9 Pro, so the S21 FE should be able to keep up with those devices easily.

Using the Galaxy S21 FE certainly feels zippy and fluid, especially with motion smoothness turned on. The interface is slick, games run without a hitch and the camera launches within just a few seconds. Samsung also says the S21 FE supports a response rate of 240Hz for even quicker reaction times in game mode, but I haven't spent enough time gaming on it yet to tell if this really makes a difference.

The Galaxy S21 FE scored about the same as Galaxy S21 but higher than the Pixel 6 on Geekbench 5, a benchmark test meant to assess the phone's performance in general tasks. However, it scored slightly lower than both the regular S21 and Pixel 6 on a separate benchmark called 3DMark Slingshot Unlimited for testing graphics performance. Check out the results below.

Samsung's new phone comes with a triple-lens camera that's very similar to the Galaxy S20 FE's camera setup. There's a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 12-megapixel wide camera and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera with a 30x digital zoom. You can also record with the front and rear cameras at the same time on the Galaxy S21 FE similar to the Galaxy S21. But unlike the regular S21, you can't toggle between the three rear lenses when using the camera in this mode.

I haven't had much time to test out the camera. But based on the few test shots I've taken, the Galaxy S21 FE certainly seems to hold its own against the Pixel 6's 50-megapixel camera and standard Galaxy S21.

The S21 FE's images are rich in detail and color, and the camera seems to perform well in different lighting conditions. We'll have more detail on camera performance in our full review, but for now check out the samples below.

The bottom line © Provided by CNET The Galaxy S21 FE is launching just before we're expecting to see the Galaxy S22. Lisa Eadicicco/CNET

There isn't much to say about the Galaxy S21 FE other than that it's a solid phone for $700. It's another sign that the definition of a high-end phone is starting to change as once-premium features like 5G, borderless displays and multilens cameras begin trickling down to more affordable devices.

I can't issue a full verdict until I've spent more time testing the Galaxy S21 FE. But if you're an Android user looking to upgrade an older phone without spending too much, I can't imagine you'll be disappointed with it.

That being said, I'd recommend waiting until Samsung announces the Galaxy S22 lineup before making a decision. Samsung typically launches its new Galaxy S phones early in the year, and rumors suggest the next generation could come with a 50-megapixel camera and faster charging. Even if you don't need those upgrades, you might as well wait so that you can make a more informed choice.

Samsung is also facing a lot of competition in the midrange phone space. While I've been enjoying using the Galaxy S21 FE so far, I also feel that Samsung could be doing more to make this device stand out, especially against the $600 Pixel 6. Although the Pixel 6 isn't perfect, Google has done a good job of differentiating its phone with specific features built around the Google Assistant, such as the ability to have the assistant screen calls and wait on hold for you.

Check back soon for more details and our full take on the Galaxy S21 FE.

Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G has officially arrived after months of leaks and speculations. This is the phone that will replace the fantastic S20 FE from 2020. Unlike the S20 FE, Samsung is not launching any LTE S21 FE this time. FE is short for ""Fan Edition.""

""We saw an incredible response to the Galaxy S20 FE and Galaxy S21 lineup,"" TM Roh, president and head of Samsung Electronics' MX (Mobile eXperience) Business said in a prepared statement, adding ""so we applied the same approach with S21 FE 5G, equipping it with the premium features that matter most to our loyal Galaxy fans.""

The Galaxy S21 FE or Fan Edition joins the flagship Galaxy S21 phones and tries to bring some of their key features to a more mainstream or mass-market segment. Some of these high-end features include a 120Hz high refresh rate display, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chip, 5G connectivity, dual stereo speakers, IP68 water and dust resistance, and wireless charging.

The biggest difference comes in the form of design. The S21 FE comes with a polycarbonate body with a matte finish. There are four colours to choose from including lavender, white, olive, and graphite. The display is also toned down to 1080p+ and flattened out though it is still Super AMOLED and boasts of Samsung's Infinity-O punch hole cut-out (this houses a 32MP camera).

The camera alignment on the back is also very Galaxy Note 21-like, which is to say Samsung is retaining the S21's contour cut aesthetics here. There are three cameras, a 12MP main, a 12MP ultra-wide angle and another 8MP telephoto for 3x optical zoom and up to 30x software-induced ""space"" zoom.

It comes in White, Lavender, Graphite, and Olive colours.

The handset will roll out in the US and some markets in Europe starting from January 11th. Samsung India has teased the handset's launch in the country, so we can expect an official announcement soon.

Samsung Galaxy S21 FE sports a 6.4-inch FHD+ Infinity-O Dynamic AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 240Hz touch sampling rate in Game Mode, 2340 x 1080 pixels resolution, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection, and punch-hole cutout to house the selfie snapper.

Samsung Galaxy S21 FE

The Galaxy S21 FE is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 5G chipset (depending on the market). It packs up to 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage. The phone runs on Android 12 OS with OneUI 4.0 custom skin out of the box. There is a 32MP snapper on the front for selfies and video chats. Connectivity features include 5G, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1, GPS, NFC, and USB Type-C port.

The phone is equipped with an IP68 rating for water resistance, USB Type-C audio, stereo speakers, surround sound with Dolby Atmos, and an in-display fingerprint sensor.

The latter statement is true, but only partially, if some new Geekbench listings and prolific leaker Ice Universe are to be believed.

It seems that the base Galaxy S22 Ultra variant will have only 8GB of RAM, according to the leaker. However, better-specced variants could up that to 12GB and 16GB. The latter could be paired with 1TB of storage, something we reported exclusively about some time ago. The extra storage would be welcome, especially due to the lack of a micro SD card slot.

We stumbled upon both the Exynos 2200 and Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Galaxy S22 models on Geekbench bearing model numbers SM-S908B and SM-S908U, respectively. The former is a carrier-unlocked variant intended for the United States and the latter is the international variant. We also get a glimpse at the Exynos 2200's lacklustre performance compared to Qualcomm's offering.

The Exynos 2200 toting Galaxy S22 Ultra nets a measly single-core score of 1,014; significantly lesser than the Snapdragon Gen 1's 1,226. Things are better off on the multi-core front, with the former scoring 3,415 and the latter 3,462. Both variants are running Android 12 out of the box and feature 8GB of system memory.

A Galaxy S22 Ultra with 8GB of RAM could disappoint fans and enthusiasts, mainly because the last-generation Galaxy S21 Ultra had 12GB of RAM across all variants. While 4GB fewer RAM will not affect its day-to-day performance, it will still be perceived as Samsung cheaping out on its magnum opus.

Followed categories will be added to My News.

CES 2022 runs from January 5-8 and will showcase the hottest new products from around the world.

It's featuring established brands like Samsung, LG, Sony, Qualcomm and Panasonic, plus a bunch of newcomers.

This year's conference will include products with 5G connectivity, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, robotics and more.

You can catch all the announcements live as they happen on the CES YouTube channel.

And while we're still waiting for the big news to drop, there has already been a slew of new tech announced.

LG TVs

LG today announced the new LG 2022 OLED TVs and they're proof TVs are getting smarter by the day.

The hi-tech TVs employ self-lighting pixels that can be turned on and off individually to ""deliver perfect blacks, natural colours and infinite contrast"".

The LG 2022 G2 series introduces a new 83-inch model and the world's first 97-inch OLED model. That's one enormous TV.

You can check out more LG announcements and products at the virtual booth here.

CES is already handing out honoree awards for some pretty cool tech and I've listed some of the best.

Motion Pillow 3

The Motion Pillow 3 senses the user's head position and detects the sound of snoring, which triggers the airbags inside the pillow. The airbag inflates to optimise the sleeper's head position without disturbing sleep. I can hear my wife ordering one already.

Abbott I-STAT TBI Plasma

The Abbott I-STAT TBI Plasma is one of the new incredible health products coming on the market.

It provides the first rapid handheld traumatic brain injury test. Tests results are available within 15 minutes. A negative result can be used to rule out the need for head CT scan, freeing up valuable hospital space.

It displays imagery with high contrast, ensuring that both dark and light details are rendered perfectly -- excellent for a game of Doom or Diablo II Resurrected.

Just take a picture of your pets' eyes or any part of their body with a mobile phone and artificial intelligence will inform you whether or not there are any eye or skin disease-related symptoms.

That can help with preventive diagnosis and treatment - a very cool way to use AI tech.

SOUNDFORM Immerse Noise Cancelling Earbuds

The SOUNDFORM Immerse Noise Cancelling Earbuds are high-fidelity earbuds with Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation.

I reviewed the Belkin Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds earlier this year and gave them the tick of approval.

NexusTouch

The NexusTouch by Boréas Technologies is the kind of tech that, once you see it, you wonder why it wasn't invented already.

It's a virtual-button design platform that expands touch-based user interfaces on the sides of smartphones and gaming phones.

Immersive trigger effects make gaming phones feel more like gaming consoles -- without the clunky mechanical toggles.

AI Studios

Watch out video producers, AI is coming for your job (and everyone else's too).

The new AI Studios by DeepBrain AI is a video production tool that makes it easy to produce videos without the need to film or employ the real people.

You can eliminate costly studio, lighting, camera, set-staff, and even the video host.

Just type the script and that enables the AI anchor to naturally speak, use body language and gestures just like a real presenter. Freaky stuff.

Solar inspection solution by hydrogen fuel cell drone

This new Doosan drone has a hydrogen fuel cell, meaning it is eco-friendly and can fly for 2+ hours with automatic mission flight.

Plus it looks like a spider.

In a single flight, it is possible to take detailed shots of hundreds of thousands of solar panels.

Saving the planet and looking cool all at the same time.

MP100 Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Portable bluetooth speakers are a dime a dozen these days, but the Edifier MP100 Plus stands out for being quite fashionable.

It has lightweight casing made from durable waterproof fabric and sturdy TPU material that achieves the water-resistant grade of IPX7. So good if you like the rough and tumble.

STARcase

The STARcase is an innovative, app-controlled cellular phone case. It allows you to display customised notifications on a LED display for calls, texts, emails, and third-party apps.

You can choose from hundreds of light shows, animated icons, and customisable scrolling text to view messages and notifications.

I'm a sucker for bright lights and would definitely buy this.

The Kinoo App

The Kinoo App is a new video communication platform that uses augmented reality and virtual activities to bring families closer together.

This is great new way for old and young people to connect during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Anything that can bring families together at this time is a winner in my book.

But the best thing about it is that it just looks damn cool.

It's also made specifically for gamers. No more lag!

Galaxy Z Fold3

It's not CES without the latest in phone technology.

Flip phones are making a comeback (hello 1980s?) in a big way this year.

The Galaxy Z Fold3 is Samsung's most advanced and durable foldable yet.

It has IPX8 water resistance, an Under Display Camera, and first-ever S Pen support on a foldable, all on a 7.6"" screen.

Sony BRAVIA CAM for TV

The Sony BRAVIA CAM for TV by Sony is a camera device equipped with a recognition engine transforms the TV viewing experience in the living room.

A camera on a TV - that's a new one for me.

A peron's location in front of the TV is analysed by skeleton estimation and face detection, which is calculated only in a private and securely protected memory bank.

The processor then optimises picture and sound quality according to the your viewing environment.

The phone has quick speeds, faster streaming, speedy downloads, and enhanced AI features with its Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.

Almost all tech is wearable these days. But what about a jewel that could save your life?

MyEli is an aesthetic and secure connected jewel, which allows a person to alert emergency contacts in case of imminent danger.

4:50

Samsung will relaunch a more affordable version of the popular Galaxy S phone on the Galaxy S21 FE. It starts at $ 700 and will be available on January 11th, following the announcement of the CES 2022. It's $ 100 cheaper than the regular Galaxy S21 and comes with a large screen, the same processor, a triple-lens camera, and support for both 5G flavors. I've only spent a few days on the Galaxy S21 FE, but it seems that most people are checking all the boxes they expect from a modern phone. The performance is excellent, you can take great pictures and the battery life is pretty impressive so far.

These attributes make the Galaxy S21 FE a promising option if you need a new, relatively affordable Android 12 device. You won't get some of the more expensive additional features you'll find on more premium phones, such as a fourth camera lens, a sharper telephoto lens, and a very sophisticated design, but choose Samsung's cheaper options. But there is no compromise.

At the same time, the Galaxy S21 FE can feel lost in Samsung's lineup and the broader Android phone market. We expect the Galaxy S22 to be available soon, and if the rumors are true, it will allow for a new 50-megapixel camera and faster charging. In addition, the $ 600 Pixel 6 is slightly cheaper than the Galaxy S21 FE and was chosen as one of our favorite mobile phones in 2021.

As I spend more time using the Galaxy S21 FE, I'll update this story, but my impressions so far are:

Sophisticated basic design very similar to the Galaxy S21

The Galaxy S21 FE looks almost the same as the Galaxy S21 when viewed from the front. Despite the large screen, it is 7.9 mm thin, similar to the standard Galaxy S21. For me, the S21 FE's 6.4-inch display and lightweight build provide the right balance between screen space and ease of use. It's bigger than the 6.2-inch Galaxy S21, but slightly smaller than Samsung's previous 6.5-inch Galaxy S20FE. -Generation midrange phones.

The screen of the Galaxy S21 FE uses Samsung's Dynamic AMOLED technology and has the same FHD + resolution as the Galaxy S21. Due to the large screen of the S21 FE, the pixel density, or pixels per inch, is lower than the Galaxy S21, but the difference is not noticeable. Photos, games and news articles all look sharp and bold on the S21FE screen. It has a flat-edged screen similar to the Galaxy 21 and Galaxy S1 Plus, and in fact prefers the slightly curved sides of the more expensive Galaxy S21 Ultra.

On the back is the same camera bump as the Galaxy S21. Both phones have a matte finish, look more elegant, and don't pick up fingerprints as easily as older Samsung phones (although they're still dirty, so we recommend using a case). However, the Galaxy S21 has some design accents that make it feel like a more expensive phone, such as a camera module and a glossy metal finish on the sides.

$ 700 is a good enough phone, but the real problem is that Google has raised the bar for middle-class phones. Google's $ 600 Pixel 6 has a gorgeous two-tone glass design that feels much more expensive than it really is. The Galaxy S21 FE is smooth and light, but doesn't leave the same impression.

There is also facial recognition to unlock the in-screen fingerprint reader and device, but I think this is generally pretty reliable. As with the Galaxy S20 FE, this model doesn't have expandable storage, but Samsung sells a new phone in another variant with 256GB of storage (the base model has 128GB).

Big battery and solid performance

The Galaxy S21 FE has the same processor as the Galaxy S21.

Lisa Eadicicco / CNET

Battery life is a highlight of the Galaxy S20 FE, and the Galaxy S21 FE seems to have followed in its footsteps so far. Like the Galaxy S20 FE, the Galaxy S21 FE comes with a 4,500mAh battery, which is larger than the regular Galaxy S21's 4,000mAh battery.

The Galaxy S21 FE had 32% of its battery left after a day and a half of use. In particular, the motion smoothness setting that raises the screen refresh rate to 120Hz was set high, so it's not that bad. The result is faster scrolling, but usually shorter battery life.

Samsung's new phone has the same processor as the Galaxy S21. So the US version works with Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. The chip is found in other high-end phones such as Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 3 and OnePlus 9 Pro, so the S21 FE needs to be able to easily adapt to these devices.

With the Galaxy S21 FE, it certainly feels smooth and smooth, especially when smoothness of movement is turned on. The interface is sophisticated, the game runs fine, and the camera launches in just a few seconds. Samsung also says that the S21 FE supports a response speed of 240Hz for even faster reaction times in game mode, but spend enough time in the game to determine if this really makes a difference. Is not ...

The Galaxy S21 FE score is about the same as the Galaxy S21, but higher than the Geekbench 5's Pixel 6. This is a benchmark test to evaluate the performance of your smartphone in common tasks. However, another benchmark called 3DMark Slingshot Unlimited for testing graphics performance scored slightly lower than both the regular S21 and Pixel 6. Check the results below.

Geekbench 5 Single Core Note: The higher the score, the better. Geekbench 5 Multicore Note: The higher the score, the better. 3DMark Slingshot Unlimited Note: The higher the score, the better. Triple lens camera similar to Galaxy S20FE

The Galaxy S21 FE is equipped with a triple lens camera.

Lisa Eadicicco / CNET

Samsung's new phone comes with a triple-lens camera that closely resembles the camera settings of the Galaxy S20FE. There are 12 megapixel ultra-wide cameras, 12 megapixel wide cameras, and 8 megapixel telescopes with 30x digital zoom. You can also record the front camera and rear camera at the same time with the Galaxy S21FE as well as the Galaxy S21. However, unlike the regular S21, you can't switch between the three rear lenses when using the camera in this mode.

I didn't have much time to test the camera. However, based on some test shots I took, the Galaxy S21 FE seems to compete with the Pixel 6's 50-megapixel camera and the standard Galaxy S21.

The images on the S21 FE are rich in detail and color, and the camera seems to work well in a variety of lighting conditions. A full review will go into the details of camera performance, but for now, check out the sample below.

Another image taken with the Galaxy S21's main wide camera.

Lisa Eadicicco / CNET Conclusion

The Galaxy S21 FE will be available shortly before the introduction of the Galaxy S22.

Lisa Eadicicco / CNET

There's not much to say about the Galaxy S21 FE, but it's a solid $ 700 phone. Another sign that the definition of high-end mobile phones is beginning to change as former premium features such as 5G, borderless displays and multi-lens cameras are beginning to permeate more affordable devices.

You won't be able to give a complete verdict until you spend more time testing the Galaxy S21 FE. But if you're an Android user trying to upgrade your old phone without spending too much money, you can't imagine you'll be disappointed with it.

That said, it's a good idea to wait until Samsung announces the Galaxy S22 lineup before making a decision. Samsung usually launches a new Galaxy S phone earlier this year, and rumor has it that the next generation could be equipped with a 50-megapixel camera and faster charging. Even if you don't need these upgrades, it's a good idea to wait for more informed choices.

Samsung also faces a lot of competition in the midrange phone space. Having enjoyed using the Galaxy S21 FE so far, Samsung feels it can do more to make this device stand out, especially for the $ 600 Pixel 6. The Pixel 6 isn't perfect, but it's a good job for Google to differentiate its smartphone with certain features built around the Google Assistant, such as the ability to call and wait on the Assistant's screen.

The South Korean giant has officially teased the upcoming smartphone ahead of the CES 2022 event. The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE's specifications have also been teased by the brand, which show a triple rear camera setup, a 4,500mAh battery, and more features. Now, the company has not put out detailed specifications of the smartphone, but it is one of the first official word on the highly anticipated smartphone.

Samsung also posted a teaser of the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE on Twitter saying ""Epic is Coming."" The teaser shows four background colours - white, black, olive, and lavender. These, according to reports, are the colours the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE is said to come in. Apart from this, the company has also teased a few specifications of the device, including the camera and battery specifications of the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE.

In a teaser on Samsung Newsroom, the South Korean giant has shared a few specifications that show that the Galaxy S21 FE will come with up to 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of internal storage. The smartphone is also coming with a triple rear camera that includes a 12-megapixel primary ultra-wide angle shooter, a 12-megapixel wide angle shooter, and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens. The smartphone will also come with a 32-megapixel front shooter, the company has announced.

In terms of battery, the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will come with a 4,500mAh battery that will have 25W fast wired charging and 15W fast wireless charging. The smartphone will also come with wireless PowerShare which will allow for reverse wireless charging of other devices. The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will also come with IP68 dust and water resistance.

Now, these are pretty much all the specifications except the processor and connectivity details. Earlier reports have suggested that the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE may come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset and 5G connectivity.

Similar to the 2020 Galaxy S20 FE (FE stands for Fan Edition), this device features most of the Galaxy S21's flagship-level specifications, such as the Snapdragon 888 chipset and 120Hz display, at a low price: 128GB base model. In the case of $ 699. The Galaxy A525G's S21s near-midrange price tag and attractive upper midrange option add yet another addition to the already crowded spots in Samsung's lineup.

The Galaxy S21 FE offers a 6.4-inch display that is slightly larger than the S21s 6.2-inch panel. Apart from its size difference, the S21FE has much in common with the S21. The screen is a 120Hz 1080p OLED panel like the S21s. Even the design language is consistent, with camera bumps blending into the side rails of the phone.

The camera bumps are matte plastic, not metal like the S21.Photo by Allison Johnson / Zavage

The FE has a flagship 5nm chipset (Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 in the US, Samsung owns Exynos elsewhere) and a 12-megapixel f / 1.8 main camera with the same optical stabilization features as the S21. It contains. The 4,500mAh cell, compared to the S21's 4,000mAh, further improves battery capacity (although the slightly larger screen may result in even battery performance). Both high-speed 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, IP68 weathering rating, and 5G flavors (sub 6 GHz and high speed millimeter waves) are all inherited from the S21.

So what do you get if you pay more for the S21? More RAM 8GB in basic configuration compared to S21 FE 6GB and high resolution telephoto cameras. Apart from the difference in size between the screen and the battery mentioned above, that's it. The Galaxy S21 FE will sell for $ 699 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and $ 769 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It ships with Samsungs Android 12 based One UI 4.0 installed.

I've had the S21FE in my hand for a few days and it feels like a device riding the chaotic line between the flagship and midrange phones. The back is a matte-finished composite plastic with a medium feel, but the screen is large and bright, with a 120Hz refresh rate flagship territory buttery smoothness. I also feel that the overall performance deserves a flagship, except that there is a slight delay in the live preview of the camera's portrait mode. Oh, there is no charger in the box. This is also the current flagship product.

Last year, Samsung announced the S20FE as a low-cost, full-featured alternative to the S20. Also at a price of $ 699, there was a big gap between it and the $ 999 base model S20, which made it a big deal. This time the situation is a little different, the price of the S21 has dropped to $ 799. One of Samsung's high-end budget phones, the Galaxy A525G, also sells for $ 499. Also, don't forget that Samsung has reduced the foldable admission fee. The GalaxyZFlip3 costs $ 999 and is part of the conversation.

It's a bit confusing, but it's not a new strategy for Samsung. As Dieter mentioned in the S20 lineup overview, Samsung has adopted this in all price range approaches because it is possible. It's also great to combine features from different price points, and a solid support policy that supports most devices makes it difficult to beat budget and midrange phones. With the S21 FE, Samsung is making yet another cut in the market, which is becoming thinner and thinner.

Samsung's doing it again. But is Samsung doing it too late?

Just as the Galaxy S20 FE made the company's flagship tech more affordable, the new Galaxy S21 FE, announced at CES, brings many of the specs of the successful Samsung Galaxy S21 line to a $699 phone.

""We're looking to give Galaxy fans the S21 experiences that have really resonated the most, starting at an accessible price point,"" says Stephen Hawke, Samsung's director of smartphone product strategy.

Carriers will make the effective price even lower than $699. AT&T tells us that the S21 FE will be available for $15/month on a three-year installment plan, for a total for $540. Verizon will offer trade-in discounts of up to $700, depending on what kind of phone you trade in -- and yes, you can trade in damaged phones.

Like with the S21, the S21 FE is based on last year's Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor in the US. (There will be an Exynos-based version for some other countries, Samsung confirms.)

It runs Android 12, sports an IP68 waterproof rating, and has a 6.4-inch, 120Hz 2,340-by-1,080 display with an optical fingerprint sensor underneath. The phone's three rear cameras are a 12MP 123-degree ultra-wide, a 12MP main, and a 8MP 3X zoom, while its front camera is 32MP. It comes in 6GB RAM/128GB storage and 8GB/256GB models, and its 4,500mAh battery supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging. You can choose between dark gray, green, purple, or white.

At 2.93 by 6.14 by 0.31 inches, it's a bit bigger than the standard S21, although it isn't as big as an S21 Ultra.

The phone has 5G, including both C-band and millimeter-wave 5G at the base price in the US. There will be a non-mmWave model launching in some other countries. It's also worth noting that the US model will have dual SIM slots.

In other words, it has all of the key features of a 2020 Android flagship, similar to the base-model Galaxy S21. Hawke suggests that the base S21 will now roll off of shelves, saying ""this will be the [S21] model going forward this year.""

The phone will go on sale on January 11, Samsung says.

The timing is the big question here. The Galaxy S20 FE launched in October 2020, in the middle of the pre-vaccine pandemic economic crash, following up an S20 line that we considered to be overpriced and often buggy. Buyers snapped it up.

""The Galaxy S20 FE was a huge hit for us. It was the right phone with the right features at the right price,"" Hawke says.

What a difference a year makes. The Galaxy S21 line was impeccable, to the point where Samsung's biggest problem has been making enough of them during a chipset shortage. Most people are back at work, without the economic fears of 2020. And the S21 FE is showing up in January, not October.

That means the S21 FE might have trouble differentiating itself from the upcoming Galaxy S22, which we expect will be launched next month, as well as the Galaxy A53 coming in March. That's a lot of Samsung coming at us very quickly, so it'll be interesting to see how the S21 FE fares. We'll have a review of it this week, so check back soon.","{'uri': 'au.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag Australia'}","[{'uri': 'sascha_segan@au.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Sascha Segan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'his_favorite@au.pcmag.com', 'name': 'His Favorite', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'texas_to_edmonton@au.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Texas To Edmonton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_au/news/s/samsung-la/samsung-launches-galaxy-s21-fe-for-699_ph8u.1200.jpg,0.1058823529411765,,True,0,0.1058823529411765,378968760,1

Followed categories will be added to My News.

CES 2022 runs from January 5-8 and will showcase the hottest new products from around the world.

It's featuring established brands like Samsung, LG, Sony, Qualcomm and Panasonic, plus a bunch of newcomers.

This year's conference will include products with 5G connectivity, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, robotics and more.

You can catch all the announcements live as they happen on the CES YouTube channel.

And while we're still waiting for the big news to drop, there has already been a slew of new tech announced.

LG TVs

LG today announced the new LG 2022 OLED TVs and they're proof TVs are getting smarter by the day.

The hi-tech TVs employ self-lighting pixels that can be turned on and off individually to ""deliver perfect blacks, natural colours and infinite contrast"".

The LG 2022 G2 series introduces a new 83-inch model and the world's first 97-inch OLED model. That's one enormous TV.

You can check out more LG announcements and products at the virtual booth here.

CES is already handing out honoree awards for some pretty cool tech and I've listed some of the best.

Motion Pillow 3

The Motion Pillow 3 senses the user's head position and detects the sound of snoring, which triggers the airbags inside the pillow. The airbag inflates to optimise the sleeper's head position without disturbing sleep. I can hear my wife ordering one already.

Abbott I-STAT TBI Plasma

The Abbott I-STAT TBI Plasma is one of the new incredible health products coming on the market.

It provides the first rapid handheld traumatic brain injury test. Tests results are available within 15 minutes. A negative result can be used to rule out the need for head CT scan, freeing up valuable hospital space.

It displays imagery with high contrast, ensuring that both dark and light details are rendered perfectly -- excellent for a game of Doom or Diablo II Resurrected.

Just take a picture of your pets' eyes or any part of their body with a mobile phone and artificial intelligence will inform you whether or not there are any eye or skin disease-related symptoms.

That can help with preventive diagnosis and treatment - a very cool way to use AI tech.

SOUNDFORM Immerse Noise Cancelling Earbuds

The SOUNDFORM Immerse Noise Cancelling Earbuds are high-fidelity earbuds with Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation.

I reviewed the Belkin Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds earlier this year and gave them the tick of approval.

NexusTouch

The NexusTouch by Boréas Technologies is the kind of tech that, once you see it, you wonder why it wasn't invented already.

It's a virtual-button design platform that expands touch-based user interfaces on the sides of smartphones and gaming phones.

Immersive trigger effects make gaming phones feel more like gaming consoles -- without the clunky mechanical toggles.

AI Studios

Watch out video producers, AI is coming for your job (and everyone else's too).

The new AI Studios by DeepBrain AI is a video production tool that makes it easy to produce videos without the need to film or employ the real people.

You can eliminate costly studio, lighting, camera, set-staff, and even the video host.

Just type the script and that enables the AI anchor to naturally speak, use body language and gestures just like a real presenter. Freaky stuff.

Solar inspection solution by hydrogen fuel cell drone

This new Doosan drone has a hydrogen fuel cell, meaning it is eco-friendly and can fly for 2+ hours with automatic mission flight.

Plus it looks like a spider.

In a single flight, it is possible to take detailed shots of hundreds of thousands of solar panels.

Saving the planet and looking cool all at the same time.

MP100 Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Portable bluetooth speakers are a dime a dozen these days, but the Edifier MP100 Plus stands out for being quite fashionable.

It has lightweight casing made from durable waterproof fabric and sturdy TPU material that achieves the water-resistant grade of IPX7. So good if you like the rough and tumble.

STARcase

The STARcase is an innovative, app-controlled cellular phone case. It allows you to display customised notifications on a LED display for calls, texts, emails, and third-party apps.

You can choose from hundreds of light shows, animated icons, and customisable scrolling text to view messages and notifications.

I'm a sucker for bright lights and would definitely buy this.

The Kinoo App

The Kinoo App is a new video communication platform that uses augmented reality and virtual activities to bring families closer together.

This is great new way for old and young people to connect during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Anything that can bring families together at this time is a winner in my book.

But the best thing about it is that it just looks damn cool.

It's also made specifically for gamers. No more lag!

Galaxy Z Fold3

It's not CES without the latest in phone technology.

Flip phones are making a comeback (hello 1980s?) in a big way this year.

The Galaxy Z Fold3 is Samsung's most advanced and durable foldable yet.

It has IPX8 water resistance, an Under Display Camera, and first-ever S Pen support on a foldable, all on a 7.6"" screen.

Sony BRAVIA CAM for TV

The Sony BRAVIA CAM for TV by Sony is a camera device equipped with a recognition engine transforms the TV viewing experience in the living room.

A camera on a TV - that's a new one for me.

A peron's location in front of the TV is analysed by skeleton estimation and face detection, which is calculated only in a private and securely protected memory bank.

The processor then optimises picture and sound quality according to the your viewing environment.

The phone has quick speeds, faster streaming, speedy downloads, and enhanced AI features with its Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.

Almost all tech is wearable these days. But what about a jewel that could save your life?

MyEli is an aesthetic and secure connected jewel, which allows a person to alert emergency contacts in case of imminent danger.

Connected to the smartphone via Bluetooth, it is linked to a 100 per cent customisable mobile application that allows several simultaneous actions to be set up in the event of an insecurity.

This is particularly good for women who might feel vulnerable walking alone at night.","{'uri': 'goldcoastbulletin.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gold Coast Bulletin'}",[],https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b566e2539dbe3a817b50fbe8acc4a9b5,0.223529411764706,,True,0,0.223529411764706,378967740,2

Motorola didn't reveal the launch date for the upcoming G-series handset. However, the popular tipster - Mukul Sharma had recently revealed that the device will launch on January 10th in India. Let us take a look at the key specifications of the Moto G71 5G,

The Moto G71 offers a 6.43-inch FHD+ OLED display with a 1080 x 2400 pixel resolution, and punch hole notch. The handset is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 processor that is built on an 8nm fabrication process. It comes coupled with Adreno 619L GPU, 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM, and 128GB of UFS 2.1 storage.

The device features a triple-rear camera setup including a 50MP shooter, an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 2MP macro lens. There is a 16MP shooter at the front for selfies and video calls. Motorola has equipped the handset with a 5,000mAh battery unit, 30W fast charging support, and USB Type-C port. The device comes in Neptune Green, Arctic Blue, and Iron Black color variants.

It is priced at €300 (approx Rs. 25,400) in the European market, so we can expect it to be priced around Rs. 25,000 in India. What's your guess on the Moto G71 India price?

Realme GT 2 series will finally debut today after months of teasers and speculation. The upcoming series will include Realme's first ever true flagship phone. This phone, the GT 2 Pro, will be everything that high-end phones from companies like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Oppo are, meaning it will have a best-in-class display, fastest processor, good cameras, and advanced battery charging technology. But since this is a Realme phone, the price will definitely be aggressive.

Realme has been yearning to make it to the big boys club. Its parent company, Oppo, joined that with the launch of the Find X series, while OnePlus had mostly been on the outskirts in the beginning but is very well a prestigious member of late. Realme started off as a brand that sells mass-market products, but it soon realised its popularity was increasing and that it could capitalise on that. So a high-end flagship seems like the best way to do that.

Realme GT 2 series launch live stream

Realme will begin the launch event at 7.30 pm CST in China. This translates to 5 pm in India. The live stream of the launch will be available on the Realme China website and Weibo.

What to expect from the Realme GT 2 series launch event

Realme is primarily expected to launch the Realme GT 2 and Realme GT 2 Pro smartphones today. But there is a possibility that the Realme GT 2 Master Edition will also make its debut alongside the two. Realme may also have some accessories to showcase, but I am not too sure about them.

Realme GT 2 series specifications and price

Of the three phones, the details of the two are widely known. The Realme GT 2 will be a vanilla phone in the series. It is expected to come with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor. However, a report suggested that there may be the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset inside. You may see up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on this phone. The Realme GT 2 may bear a 50-megapixel triple camera setup on the back, and a 16-megapixel selfie camera. It may use a 5000mAh battery with 65W fast charging.

The Realme GT 2 Pro, on the other hand, will be the top-end phone with a 6.7-inch 2K LTPO display with a punch-hole and a 120Hz refresh rate. It will have the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection on top. The fingerprint sensor on this phone may embed a heart rate monitor, as well. The GT 2 Pro may come with a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor, which has been used in flagship phones like Find X3 Pro. The camera may feature optical image stabilisation for the first time on a Realme phone, while the rear system may include a microscope camera, as well.

Realme confirmed last year that its first true flagship phone will cost around $800, which is roughly Rs 60,000. But that is not the exact price. We will find out about that at today's launch.","{'uri': 'indiatoday.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'India Today'}","[{'uri': 'shubham_verma@indiatoday.in', 'name': 'Shubham Verma', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202201/realmegt2pro_29122021-647x363.png?CC9QTMqXrldbe.mP5p81G2NcOXeUpd4a,0.5215686274509803,eng-7378497,False,0.8352941274642944,0.5215686274509803,378966360,1

OnePlus is yet again applying the usual tactics to create buzz around its new product. The Chinese smartphone company dropped the first official look of the OnePlus 10 Pro and we aren't surprised to see the design.

The design corroborates previously leaked renders and reveals the phone having a metal frame that curves wrapping around the camera bump. OnePlus has tweaked the design of the OnePlus 10 Pro on the rear side only to make it look less appealing. The huge camera bump seems to be inspired by the Samsung Galaxy S21 series. The camera comes with Hasselblad branding and is said to deliver a better experience for mobile photography. The redesigned module is housing three cameras with a circular flash and a fourth slot having a 'P2D 50T' sensor.

OnePlus showed the new device in Black and Green colourways, both using matte glass and signature Alert Slider on the right edge of the frame. While the handset maker showed the OnePlus 10 Pro's design in all its glory, it didn't disclose any detail on the specs and features. But the barrage of leaks in the past and a few teasers from the company have already given a fair idea of what to expect from the new flagship.

OnePlus 10 Pro specs

The upcoming flagship is expected to feature a 6.7-inch QuadHD+ AMOLED display with a 2K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. OnePlus has already confirmed its new premium handset will get the flavour of Qualcomm's freshly baked Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 silicon. OnePlus 10 Pro might come with at least 12GB of RAM, and 256GB native storage. For photography, the triple camera setup might consist of a 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens, and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens with 3x zoom support. The phone could offer a 32-megapixel front shooter for taking selfies and making video calls. The handset will likely have IP68 water and dust resistance and have an in-display fingerprint reader for security. It will run OxygenOS based Android 12 OS.

Reports suggest that the phone might carry a 5,000mAh battery and support super fast 125W charging solution. OnePlus 10 Pro will make its official debut on January 11. However, reports indicate that the handset will be exclusive to China this time and there may not be a timeline for release in India, Europe, and North America.

It's featuring established brands like Samsung, LG, Sony, Qualcomm and Panasonic, plus a bunch of newcomers.

This year's conference will include products on 5G connectivity, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, smart cities, sports, robotics and more.

You can catch all the announcements live as they happen on the CES YouTube channel.

And while we're still waiting for the big news to drop, there has already been a slew of new tech announced.

LG TVs

LG today announced the new LG 2022 OLED TVs and they're proof TVs are getting smarter by the day.

The hi-tech TVs employ self-lighting pixels that can be turned on and off individually to ""deliver perfect blacks, natural colours and infinite contrast"".

The LG 2022 G2 series introduces a new 83-inch model and the world's first 97-inch OLED model. That's one enormous TV.

You can check out more LG announcements and products at the virtual booth here.

CES is already handing out honoree awards for some pretty cool tech and I've listed some of the best.

Motion Pillow 3

The Motion Pillow 3 senses the user's head position and detects the sound of snoring, which triggers the airbags inside the pillow. The airbag inflates to optimise the sleeper's head position without disturbing sleep. I can hear my wife ordering one already.

Abbott I-STAT TBI Plasma

The Abbott I-STAT TBI Plasma is one of the new incredible health products coming on the market.

It provides the first rapid handheld traumatic brain injury test. Tests results are available within 15 minutes. A negative result can be used to rule out the need for head CT scan, freeing up valuable hospital space.

It displays imagery with high contrast, ensuring that both dark and light details are rendered perfectly -- excellent for a game of Doom or Diablo II Resurrected.

Just take a picture of your pets' eyes or any part of their body with a mobile phone and artificial intelligence will inform you whether or not there are any eye or skin disease-related symptoms.

That can help with preventive diagnosis and treatment - a very cool way to use AI tech.

SOUNDFORM Immerse Noise Cancelling Earbuds

The SOUNDFORM Immerse Noise Cancelling Earbuds are high-fidelity earbuds with Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation.

I reviewed the Belkin Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds earlier this year and gave them the tick of approval.

NexusTouch

The NexusTouch by Boréas Technologies is the kind of tech that, once you see it, you wonder why it wasn't invented already.

It's a virtual-button design platform that expands touch-based user interfaces on the sides of smartphones and gaming phones.

Immersive trigger effects make gaming phones feel more like gaming consoles -- without the clunky mechanical toggles.

AI Studios

Watch out video producers, AI is coming for your job (and everyone else's too).

The new AI Studios by DeepBrain AI is a video production tool that makes it easy to produce videos without the need to film or employ the real people.

You can eliminate costly studio, lighting, camera, set-staff, and even the video host.

Just type the script and that enables the AI anchor to naturally speak, use body language and gestures just like a real presenter. Freaky stuff.

Solar inspection solution by hydrogen fuel cell drone

This new Doosan drone has a hydrogen fuel cell, meaning it is eco-friendly and can fly for 2+ hours with automatic mission flight.

Plus it looks like a spider.

In a single flight, it is possible to take detailed shots of hundreds of thousands of solar panels.

Saving the planet and looking cool all at the same time.

MP100 Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Portable bluetooth speakers are a dime a dozen these days, but the Edifier MP100 Plus stands out for being quite fashionable.

It has lightweight casing made from durable waterproof fabric and sturdy TPU material that achieves the water-resistant grade of IPX7. So good if you like the rough and tumble.

STARcase

The STARcase is an innovative, app-controlled cellular phone case. It allows you to display customised notifications on a LED display for calls, texts, emails, and third-party apps.

You can choose from hundreds of light shows, animated icons, and customisable scrolling text to view messages and notifications.

I'm a sucker for bright lights and would definitely buy this.

The Kinoo App

The Kinoo App is a new video communication platform that uses augmented reality and virtual activities to bring families closer together.

This is great new way for old and young people to connect during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Anything that can bring families together at this time is a winner in my book.

But the best thing about it is that it just looks damn cool.

It's also made specifically for gamers. No more lag!

Galaxy Z Fold3

It's not CES without the latest in phone technology.

Flip phones are making a comeback (hello 1980s?) in a big way this year.

The Galaxy Z Fold3 is Samsung's most advanced and durable foldable yet.

It has IPX8 water resistance, an Under Display Camera, and first-ever S Pen support on a foldable, all on a 7.6"" screen.

Sony BRAVIA CAM for TV

The Sony BRAVIA CAM for TV by Sony is a camera device equipped with a recognition engine transforms the TV viewing experience in the living room.

A camera on a TV - that's a new one for me.

A peron's location in front of the TV is analysed by skeleton estimation and face detection, which is calculated only in a private and securely protected memory bank.

The processor then optimises picture and sound quality according to the your viewing environment.

The phone has quick speeds, faster streaming, speedy downloads, and enhanced AI features with its Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.

Almost all tech is wearable these days. But what about a jewel that could save your life?

MyEli is an aesthetic and secure connected jewel, which allows a person to alert emergency contacts in case of imminent danger.

Connected to the smartphone via Bluetooth, it is linked to a 100 per cent customisable mobile application that allows several simultaneous actions to be set up in the event of an insecurity.

This is particularly good for women who might feel vulnerable walking alone at night.","{'uri': 'news.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'News.com.au'}",[],https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b566e2539dbe3a817b50fbe8acc4a9b5,0.2,,False,0,0.2,378965520,2

The smartphone, likely the last entry in the S21 series, will succeed the popular S20 FE and S21 FE 5G, while improving on features and specifications. The new S21 FE comes with a Snapdragon 888 chipset, an AMOLED screen and three cameras on the back.

Here is everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE smartphone, including price, specifications, features and availability.

The phone has a 6.4-inch 2340×1080 AMOLED display with support for 120Hz refresh rate and a 240Hz touch sampling rate. There is also an under-display optical fingerprint scanner here. There is a new S21-series like design here with the camera bump integrated into the matte-finish back panel with the left and top edges extending into the edges of the phone. The flash module is however, placed outside the camera island.

The phone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset like the S21 series and supports 5G. You also get a lighter and slimmer body at 1777 grams and 7.9mm thickness with a 4,500mAh battery that supports 25W wired fast charging and 15W wireless charging.

There is a triple-camera setup on the back of the phone, with a 12MP main sensor with OIS, a 12MP ultrawide sensor, and an 8MP 3x telephoto sensor. On the front is a 32MP fixed focus camera that is cased in a centre-aligned punch-hole cutout.

Samsung has also thrown in a number of shooting modes in the Galaxy S21 FE. This includes a multi-camera recording mode that lets you capture video from the front and rear cameras at the same time as well as a night mode that can take up to 14 images at the same time to capture more lighting and details, combining the lot into a single shot. An object eraser feature in the gallery also lets you erase unwanted objects from pictures.

Other features include an IP68 certification, Barometer support, NFC and One UI 4.0 based on Android 12 out of the box. The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE is globally available starting at USD 699 (about Rs 52,031) and is available in three storage variants - 6GB/128GB, 8GB/128GB and 8GB/256GB.

After several months of leaks and rumors, we have the official images of the new OnePlus 10 Pro. Unfortunately, this isn't a worldwide launch or even an official announcement that reveals everything there is to know about the device. But at least we go to see the device's final design just moments before the official announcement of the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE during CES 2022.

The new OnePlus 10 Pro has been officially revealed by OnePlus. The announcement surprised us, as it came earlier than expected, and it arrived without the vanilla variant. Whatever the case, the OnePlus 10 Pro looks to be a massive upgrade from its predecessor. The new device features a new wrap-around camera bump that makes us remember the Samsung Galaxy S21 series design. This new camera also arrives with Hasselblad branding, suggesting that we may have a great photographic experience, even though that wasn't necessarily the case with the OnePlus 9 Pro.

There are no further details about the device that reveals everything we want to know about the OnePlus 10 Pro. Still, the official images reveal that the new camera module has three camera sensors and a fourth item branded as ""P2D 50T,"" but we have no clue what this sensor will do or if it's just a flashy-looking LED light. The design also reveals that the power button is, as always, placed on the right side of the phone, just under the alert slider that is now placed next to the camera bump.

We will have to wait for more official information which unveils the OnePlus 10 Pro's specs and key features.

Out of five, two smartphones have already been launched in India, the other phones including the Moto G51 will be launched in the coming months.

As per a GSM arena report, Motorola may release the Moto G51 in the Indian market on January 10. However, the information is only based on the inputs provided by the tipsters, Motorola is yet to officially announce the launch of the Moto G71 along with the launch date. If the rumours turn out to be true, Motorola India will get another smartphone added to its portfolio. The Moto G71 is powered by the Snapdragon 695 5G chipset, it is the first smartphone to feature Snapdragon 695 chipset.

Moto G71: Expected Price and availability

Moto G71 is currently available in two markets including China and Europe. The smartphone was launched in Europe at 299.99 euros (roughly Rs. 25,200). In the Chinese market, the smartphone was launched for ¥1,699 (Rs 20,000 approximately) for the 8GB+128GB variant. The smartphone could be priced at around Rs 20,000- Rs 25,000 in India as well.

Moto G71: Specifications

The specifications of the Moto G71 is already known to us given the fact that it was already made official in Europe and China. The Moto G71 comes with a 6.4-inch full-HD+ OLED display with a resolution of 1,080x2,400 pixels. The display comes with a standard refresh rate of 60hz.

As with every new OnePlus handset, full and highly accurate leaks appeared well in advance. We also knew previously that OnePlus would be skipping the OnePlus 9T name and powering straight to 10 and 10 Pro.

The new phone features a camera housing (again with Hasselblad branding) that wraps around the side of the phone slightly and has a reflective design to contrast with the rest of the matte design. It houses triple rear cameras and a flash. We now also know the phone will be available with two finishes - volcanic black and forest emerald (er, green).

According to OnePlus, the ceramic material used is 13 times tougher than glass.

Thanks to a previous OnePlus announcement, we already know that the handset will feature the hot-off-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 platform at its heart.

That's not surprising considering top-end OnePlus phones always feature the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon chips. And there have been numerous other leaks, too.

As to when we'll get more official info, the official OnePlus blog says the phone is 'upcoming' and we'll leave it at that...

However, we already knew from a Weibo post by OnePlus chief Pete Lau that the OnePlus 10 Pro will be available in China in January and we now know this is set for 11 January.

However, this year, Samsung's new Fan Edition smartphone breaks tradition and mixes things up a bit to the relief of customers in Europe.

This year, the Galaxy S21 FE in both the USA and Europe is powered by the Snapdragon 888 chipset supplied by Qualcomm. Samsung has leveled the playing field for both continents, and although customers in the USA are used to Galaxy devices powered by Qualcomm solutions, European customers are not. With the Galaxy S21 FE, they'll have a chance to see how life is on the other side of the pond.

Some Galaxy S21 FE variants still get an Exynos SoC

Samsung confirmed that the Galaxy S21 FE has the same Qualcomm chipset in both the USA and Europe but didn't say much about other regions. However, as we've mentioned before, the Galaxy S21 FE is not the same everywhere, which means that there must be an Exynos variant somewhere. And, there is.

Samsung will only sell the Exynos 2100 variant in some regions. Customers in most Asian markets will get the Galaxy S21 FE carrying the ""E"" model number, which has an Exynos 2100 SoC. Exactly how the company will divvy up the Exynos 2100 and Snapdragon variants in Asia on a per-country basis is unclear, but we'll keep you posted once we find out more.

The Snapdragon 888 and Exynos 2100 chipsets were manufactured on a 5nm process. They each have a mix of eight CPU cores (Cortex-X1, Cortex-A78, Cortex-A55). The Snapdragon 888 SoC includes an Adreno 660 graphics chip, whereas the Exynos variant has a Mali-G78 MP14 GPU.

Samsung will release the Galaxy S21 FE on January 11 in most markets. In Europe, the UK, and the USA, the base model equipped with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage will set customers back €749 / £699 / $699.

The upcoming OnePlus 10 series handset will launch on January 11th in China. The company took to the OnePlus Community forum to make an announcement for the same and also revealed the official first look of the OnePlus 10 Pro. Alongside, the first look, OnePlus also revealed that the OnePlus 10 Pro will come in two color options - Volcanic Black and Forest Emerald. Take a look at the official renders below.

OnePlus has also set up a landing page for the OnePlus 10 Pro on the OnePlus UK website. However, the landing page doesn't mention the launch date anywhere, so we can assume that the handset is not launching on 11th January in global markets. The renders shared by the company showcase the rear panel design of the handset. OnePlus says that the new design takes the company's unified and stylish design philosophy to the next level.

Pete, in the OnePlus Community post, shared,

The OnePlus 10 Pro also sports a brand-new look that takes our burdenless, unified, and stylish design philosophy to the next level. Of course, your eyes are drawn first to the OnePlus 10 Pro's new camera system - with three rear cameras and a flash - that seamlessly merges from the phone's metal chassis to its rear glass panel.

Made out of ceramics - a material with a fracture toughness 13 times that of glass - the mirrored camera module creates a seamless flow with the matte frosted glass around it perfectly complementing each other.

The camera module on the OnePlus 10 Pro seamlessly merges from the phone's chassis to the rear glass panel. The camera module is made using ceramic material that has a fracture toughness 13 times that of glass. Whereas, the back panel uses matte frosted glass.

The OnePlus 10 Pro is said to feature a 6.7-inch Curved LTPO AMOLED display with 2K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. The handset will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor and Adreno 730 GPU. It is said to be equipped with a 5,000mAh battery, 80W fast charging, and 50W wireless charging.

The OnePlus 10 Pro will feature a triple rear camera setup. The primary sensor on the device is said to be a 48MP sensor which might be accompanied by a 50MP ultra-wide-angle sensor and an 8MP auxiliary sensor. For selfies, the upcoming OnePlus flagship is said to offer a 32MP shooter inside a punch-hole notch.

The global semiconductor industry, which was beset by supply challenges in 2021 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, is poised for a big rebound this year, with sales pegged to cross $600 billion for the first time.

The boom in sales will be driven by ""unusually strong"" demand for consumer electronics, according to a new study from Euler Hermes, a subsidiary of German financial services company Allianz.

Worldwide chip sales surged 26 per cent to hit an all-time high of $553 billion in 2021, making the wider electronic component industry one of the winners from the pandemic, Euler Hermes added.

The industry is expected to grow 9 per cent in 2022, leading it to surpass the $600bn mark, Euler Hermes predicts.

""The current semiconductor cycle has been firing on all cylinders since the industry emerged from its worst recession in 2019 [minus 12 per cent]. Volumes have been driven by unusually strong demand for consumer electronics, prices have increased because of a tight supply/demand equilibrium and the product mix has improved with the introduction of higher-priced, new-generation chips using the 5nm manufacturing node,"" the credit insurance company said.

Personal computers, smartphones, and audio and video equipment accounted for 80 per cent of final semiconductor sales and were the three main factors driving the industry's growth.

The surge in sales for electronic devices during the pandemic created a bigger-than-anticipated demand for semiconductors, leading to a shortage in the industry. The US-China trade spat is also a factor, since many companies from both sides do business with each other. Huawei, for example, is unable to supply semiconductors to its US counterparts, having been blacklisted by Washington.

And as the making of chips is a complex process that takes months, manufacturing cannot be increased on short notice.

Global chips are expected to remain in short supply in the coming months, but are expected to return to normal levels by the second quarter of 2022, according to industry analysts.

The auto industry was among the hardest hit. Research firm Gartner last month said the global semiconductor shortage will drive nearly 50 per cent of the top 10 carmakers to design and produce their own chips by 2025.

It added that supply chain disruptions, chip scarcity, the electrification of vehicles and autonomous trends will compel automotive original equipment manufacturers to reduce their reliance on traditional chip makers, giving car makers more control over their product road map and supply chains.

Entering 2021, officials at automotive bellwethers Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and Nissan all said they have been hit by the shortage and have been forced to delay production of some models in order to keep other factories running.

On the other hand, Tesla, the world's biggest electric vehicle maker, managed to work around the crisis by using new chip designs and rewriting the software it uses on its vehicles, its chief executive Elon Musk said.

The ongoing chip shortage is expected to help chipmakers such as Intel, Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries among others. GlobalFoundries capitalised on the market conditions and listed on New York's Nasdaq in October to raise $2.6bn.

The world's third-largest semiconductor manufacturer, owned by Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Company, is poised to grow significantly in the coming years, in line with emerging industries and as demand for chips is expected to soar, Mubadala chief executive and managing director Khaldoon Al Mubarak told The National at the time, stressing its strategy to shift investments towards industries of the future.

Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker by revenue, last month said it will increase capacity by adding facilities in France and Italy, plus a major production site in Germany, Bloomberg News reported.

However, Euler Hermes said that it expects all three factors to cool down as final demand growth normalises and new capacities come online.

""Further ahead, the industry will enter 2023 in the fourth year of its current growth cycle and is likely to experience a plateau in sales. History shows a semiconductor cycle lasts four to five years and is followed by a period of adjustment lasting 12 months on average,"" it added.

Growing political support for a greater independence from imports from Asia in Japan, North America and Europe has also been noted in recent months. Because they were given a comparatively low priority in the order book of Asian manufacturers, their local automotive and machinery industries were hit hard by acute shortages, causing factories to close and translating into billions in lost revenues.

In September, US and EU trade and competition officials launched a new forum joining forces to boost semiconductor supplies.

""While we do not anticipate such moves to challenge Asia's domination in semiconductor manufacturing in the short term, they will most likely contribute to more balanced trade flows in a more distant future,"" Euler Hermes said.","{'uri': 'thenationalnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The National'}",[],https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/e2HatK8UpM7yX0x8Cd_dqFuRPbQ=/1440x810/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thenational/SQFJDEPUYEUE7D3LFOFJMGL774.jpg,0.2392156862745098,eng-7379786,False,0.7019608020782471,0.2392156862745098,378963420,1

The operators, China Unicom, NTT DOCOMO, Telstra, TIM and, Verizon and vendors, Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies Inc. will share mmWave intelligence, best practices and use cases to educate and inspire stakeholders around the world. The accelerator initiative aims to underline the role that mmWave plays in unlocking the full potential of 5G.

It is estimated that by 2025, mobile technologies and services will contribute almost $5 trillion to the global economy and there will be 1.8 billion 5G connections. As stakeholders benefit from the improvements in productivity and efficiency that result from the increased take-up of very high-speed mobile services, mmWave is emerging as an important element of the 5G technology mix.

5G mmWave delivers increased bandwidth, fast data speeds and, lower latency to users. It particularly benefits densely populated areas - such as campuses and entertainment and sports venues - as it is a cost-effective way to increase network capacity.

A combined mmWave and 3.5GHz network is estimated to contribute savings of up to 35 per cent in the total cost of ownership compared to the sole use of sub-6 GHz bands. It also facilitates the expansion into new areas including Fixed Wireless Access with fibre-like speeds. There are already over 140 pre-commercial and commercial devices supporting 5G mmWave.

The GSMA-led accelerator initiative will spearhead projects focused on the exploration of everyday business implementations and increasing education efforts around mmWave benefits.

The group envisages that this first stage will be completed in time for MWC Barcelona in February 2022, complementing the event's Connectivity Unleashed theme.

""We're excited to be assisting our members and partners in unlocking the huge potentials of 5G, of which mmWave is a key element. This GSMA accelerator initiative, will demonstrate what harnessing 5G mmWave can achieve and inspire others as to its many benefits,"" said Mr Alex Sinclair, Chief Technology Officer, GSMA.

In 2021, for the first time, OnePlus went ahead with a MediaTek chipset for one of its smartphones -- Nord 2 5G. A thing worth noting here is that the Nord 2 isn't a flagship smartphone. It is a mid-ranger from the company, and thus the flagship smartphones from the company were still running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets. This time around, the OnePlus 10 series might feature a device with a MediaTek chipset. OnePlus 10 series will be the company's flagship series in 2022 that is expected to launch around March.

The OnePlus smartphone that is expected to feature the MediaTek Chipset is the vanilla OnePlus 10. Again, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer is expected to launch at least two smartphones in 2022 in its flagship series -- OnePlus 10 and OnePlus 10 Pro. There might be a OnePlus 10R as well. The OnePlus 10 is expected to feature the MediaTek chipset, so naturally, if there is a OnePlus 10R, it should also feature a MediaTek SoC, but nothing's confirmed yet.

The OnePlus 10 might launch globally with the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 SoC. The Dimensity 9000 was announced by MediaTek in December 2021, and it is the company's flagship SoC for 2022. A popular tipster, Yogesh Brar, along with MySmartPrice, have indicated OnePlus is testing a smartphone with MediaTek Dimensity 9000 SoC.

Further, one other very new thing that we might see with the OnePlus 10 series is the arrival of a unified OS from Oppo and OnePlus. The Dimensity 9000 SoC is a powerful chipset fabricated using the 4nm process.

There's not a lot of time left for the OnePlus 10 series to launch globally. Again, it will be the first time that OnePlus will be launching a flagship smartphone with a MediaTek chipset. This might be because of the global chip shortage, or OnePlus might be getting the chipset at a lower cost from MediaTek.","{'uri': 'telecomtalk.info', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TelecomTalk'}","[{'uri': 'tanay_singh_thakur@telecomtalk.info', 'name': 'Tanay Singh Thakur', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://telecomtalk.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oneplus-might-introduce-new-flagship-with-mediatek-1024x683.jpeg,0.07450980392156858,eng-7376935,False,0.7058823704719543,0.07450980392156858,378962580,1

That certainly applies to Samsung, which tends to save its big mobile news for Mobile World Congress, a month or two from now. Instead, the event is more about big things: TVs, washing machines, etc.

Over the past few years, however, the electronics giant has used the show as a platform for launching its budget flagship -- again, just ahead of the launch of its...flagship-flagship S series. Over the years, Samsung has toyed around with various names for the product, including the ""Lite,"" before settling on ""FE"" -- short for ""Fan Edition."" Seems last year's device was a big success for the company. It notes, ""Since its launch in Q4 2020, Galaxy S20 FE sold 10 million units in just over a year, making it one of Samsung's best-selling Galaxy smartphones over the past year.

Ultimately, the company no doubt landed on the notion that naming a device ""Lite"" was really leading with the fact that the product was ""less than,"" from a spec standpoint. So it's positioning these devices as a kind of fan service -- offering some of the luxuries of the higher-priced devices, while dulling some of the bleeding edges in the name of keeping costs down.

For the newly announced Galaxy S21 FE 5G, that's a starting price of $699 (roughly one dollar per letter of the product's name). That's the same price point the company hit with last year's S20 -- and $100 more than Google's Pixel 6, which has catapulted to the top of the list of affordable flagships (apologies if the flagship and budget distinctions get sort of nebulous here).

""We saw an incredible response to the Galaxy S20 FE and Galaxy S21 lineup,"" says Samsung's TM Roh in a release. ""So we applied the same approach with S21 FE 5G, equipping it with the premium features that matter most to our loyal Galaxy fans -- because we're focused on delivering a smartphone that meets their most important needs.""

The handset sports a 6.4-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 processor, as its successor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, is starting rollout on flagships from companies like Xiaomi. There's a triple camera system with a 12-megapixel main, 32-megapixel ultrawide and 12-megapixel telephoto. The system comes with either 6 or 8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage, along with a solid 4,500mAh battery. And, of course, as the name implies, there's 5G on-board.

The design borrows plenty of cues from the standard S21, though the premium build has been swapped out for a lower-cost plastic construction.

Samsung said the latest smartphone, despite its budget-friendly pricing, shares the same processor as the high-end Galaxy S21 series, which means it is mounted with either Samsung's Exynos or Qualcomm's Snapdragon.

The device's 6.4-inch AMOLED display supports a refresh rate of 120Hz, which is good news for gamers. Weighing just 177 grams, the smartphone offers a storage space of 128 or 256 gigabytes. The RAM size comes in modest 6 or 8 gigabytes.

The smartphone also supports dual recording that allows users to take photos or videos with front and rare cameras at the same time.

The official launch of Galaxy S21 FE 5G is set for Jan. 11 and be available in countries depending on their market conditions.

The new OnePlus 10 Pro is one of the phones that we're already looking forward to. The device is expected to make an appearance sometime in March or April but, as always, rumors and leaks pop up online much earlier than that.

This time, a bunch of info about the phone's specifications has popped up online, via the Chinese microblogging website Weibo. Of course, you have every right to be excited about it, but still, take this information with a grain of salt.

Top Upcoming Phones 2022 (First Arrivals)

To begin with, the OnePlus 10 Pro will have a 6.7-inch AMOLED LTPO display, with a 2K resolution. With that hardware, if any device will deliver a smooth viewing experience, it will definitely be the OnePlus 10 pro.

It will have a 120Hz refresh rate and the upper left corner will feature a punch-hole cutout for the selfie camera.

Under the hood we will find, of course, Qualcomm's latest chipset: the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC. There will be various RAM combinations available for the model, between 8 and 12GB, as far as we can tell, as well as 128 and 256GB for the storage.

The phone will have a mammoth 5,000mAh battery with 80W SuperVOOC fast charging and 50W wireless charging.

As far as cameras go, we know that the main sensor will be a 48MP, a 50MP ultra-wide and an 8MP telephoto lens with 3x zoom.

On the front, we'll find a 32MP selfie snapper.

The OnePlus 10 Pro will be 8.5mm thick, making this device thinner than the 8.7mm thick OnePlus 9 Pro and overall thinner than most other top Android devices out there.

It will run Android 12 out of the box, with Oxygen OS 12 on top.

OnePlus CEO Pete Lau confirms January release date on Weibo

The phone will be unveiled at some point this January, most likely the 4th, and we don't have any information regarding pricing or global availability either.

However, the entry-level OnePlus 9 Pro was priced at around $969, so we wouldn't be surprised to see the OnePlus 10 Pro arrive with a similar, if not even higher price tag.

iQOO has managed to convince everyone with its 7 and 8 series that it's a brand to be recognized and that it won't be going away anytime soon. Now, the series 8 successor the iQOO 9 is on its way and here are the details we know about it thus far.

Starting with the base model, the device will feature a 6.78-inch Full HD+ display, with a 120Hz refresh rate.

The Pro model, while it keeps the same specs, has a curved panel and QHD+. The iQOO 8 and 8 Pro both featured a Samsung AMOLED E5 panel and the 9 series will have the same one, with one extra upgrade: LTPO 2.0 technology.

The iQOO 9 series will also be equipped with an ultrasonic ID sensor: the Qualcomm 3D Sonic Max. This sensor will have a surface of 578mm, which is wider than the ones we usually find on smartphones, and should, in theory, be more effective.

The device will feature Qualcomm's latest chipset under the hood: the 8 Gen 1. This chipset is manufactured with a 4nm technology and has an octa-core CPU ARMv9 up to 3 GHz and a more powerful GPU Adreno by 30% compared to that of the Snapdragon 888 and 888+.

Qualcomm Unveils The Much-Anticipated Snapdragon 8 Gen1 Chipset

Rumors have said that the two devices will come in the following memory configurations: 8/128 GB, 12/256 GB and 12/512 GB for the vanilla iQOO 9 and 8/256 GB, 12/256 GB and 12/512 GB for the iQOO 9 Pro.

The company has already confirmed a 4,700mAh battery and, while some rumors mentioned that the device will have a 125W fast charging capabilities, iQOO has confirmed 120W fast charging in a recent teaser image.

Moreover, the 50W wireless charging is not reserved only for the Pro model - the base model will feature it as well.

The phones will have Android 12 out of the box but they might have Origin OS Ocean on top.

In the camera department, both phones will feature a Samsung ISOCELL GN5 sensor, of 50MP, replacing the GN1.

The vanilla version will have a 13MP wide angle lens and a 12MP.

On the Pro model we will also find a wide-angle ISOCELL JN1, the same one used by Realme on the GT 2 Pro. The Pro will also feature a 16MP.

For the rest of the configuration, again for the Pro it is then composed of a sensor for 16 MP Portraits . Moving on to the basic model, the main one is combined with a 13

iQOO 9 will officially debut in China, on January 5th and we might see the phone available outside of the country as early as February.

This latter information however, is pieced together from rumors, so take it with a grain of salt.

Samsung's doing it again. But is Samsung doing it too late?

Just as the Galaxy S20 FE made the company's flagship tech more affordable, the new Galaxy S21 FE, announced at CES, brings many of the specs of the successful Samsung Galaxy S21 line to a $699 phone.

""We're looking to give Galaxy fans the S21 experiences that have really resonated the most, starting at an accessible price point,"" says Stephen Hawke, Samsung's director of smartphone product strategy.

Carriers will make the effective price even lower than $699. AT&T tells us that the S21 FE will be available for $15/month on a three-year installment plan, for a total for $540. Verizon will offer trade-in discounts of up to $700, depending on what kind of phone you trade in -- and yes, you can trade in damaged phones.

Like with the S21, the S21 FE is based on last year's Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor in the US. (There will be an Exynos-based version for some other countries, Samsung confirms.)

It runs Android 12, sports an IP68 waterproof rating, and has a 6.4-inch, 120Hz 2,340-by-1,080 display with an optical fingerprint sensor underneath. The phone's three rear cameras are a 12MP 123-degree ultra-wide, a 12MP main, and a 8MP 3X zoom, while its front camera is 32MP. It comes in 6GB RAM/128GB storage and 8GB/256GB models, and its 4,500mAh battery supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging. You can choose between dark gray, green, purple, or white.

At 2.93 by 6.14 by 0.31 inches, it's a bit bigger than the standard S21, although it isn't as big as an S21 Ultra.

The phone has 5G, including both C-band and millimeter-wave 5G at the base price in the US. There will be a non-mmWave model launching in some other countries. It's also worth noting that the US model will have dual SIM slots.

In other words, it has all of the key features of a 2020 Android flagship, similar to the base-model Galaxy S21. Hawke suggests that the base S21 will now roll off of shelves, saying ""this will be the [S21] model going forward this year.""

The phone will go on sale on January 11, Samsung says.

The timing is the big question here. The Galaxy S20 FE launched in October 2020, in the middle of the pre-vaccine pandemic economic crash, following up an S20 line that we considered to be overpriced and often buggy. Buyers snapped it up.

""The Galaxy S20 FE was a huge hit for us. It was the right phone with the right features at the right price,"" Hawke says.

What a difference a year makes. The Galaxy S21 line was impeccable, to the point where Samsung's biggest problem has been making enough of them during a chipset shortage. Most people are back at work, without the economic fears of 2020. And the S21 FE is showing up in January, not October.

That means the S21 FE might have trouble differentiating itself from the upcoming Galaxy S22, which we expect will be launched next month, as well as the Galaxy A53 coming in March. That's a lot of Samsung coming at us very quickly, so it'll be interesting to see how the S21 FE fares. We'll have a review of it this week, so check back soon.","{'uri': 'in.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag India'}","[{'uri': 'sascha_segan@in.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Sascha Segan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'his_favorite@in.pcmag.com', 'name': 'His Favorite', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'texas_to_edmonton@in.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Texas To Edmonton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_in/news/s/samsung-la/samsung-launches-galaxy-s21-fe-for-699_bntu.1200.jpg,0.1058823529411765,,True,0,0.1058823529411765,378960120,1

The new Galaxy S21 FE - also known as ""Fan Edition - comes with an improved ""eye-catching design"", a powerful new chipset, an enhanced camera with improved capabilities, and many more advancements over its previous generation.

The new Samsung Galaxy S21 FE comes with a 6.4-inch FHD Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with 120Hz refresh rate and a 240Hz touch sampling rate. The display will also have the optical fingerprint sensor built-in, and it'll be home to the hole-punch cutout that houses the 32MP selfie camera with f/2.2. Much like the Galaxy S20 FE, the S21 FE is also IP68 water and dust-resistant.

The device will be powered by the 5nm 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset, and it will be available with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, as well as 8GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. There will be no microSD card slot.

There are three cameras on the back, including a 12MP primary sensor with f/1.8 and Dual Pixel Autofocus and Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), a 12MP ultrawide with f/2.2, and an 8MP telephoto sensor with 30X Space Zoom and f/2.4.

The battery has 4,500 mAh capacity, and it supports 25W fast wired charging, 15W wireless, and Wireless PowerShare. As with all Samsung devices at this point, the 25W wall adapter will not be included in the box, and it will be sold separately. The S21 FE will come with One UI 4.0 based on Android 12, and it will have support for Sub6 5G.

Verizon already announced its plans to sell the new Galaxy S21 FE and it will be available in four color options, including Olive, Graphite, Lavender, and White in both 128/256GB storage configurations. The S21 FE will be available at Verizon from January 11 for $23.33 a month on a 30-month contract, and customers can also get up to $700 with a qualifying trade-in on select Unlimited plans on a new line, or when they switch. Customers can also get up to $1,000 when they switch to help with any balance remaining on existing networks.

Despite being the more affordable option in Samsung's Galaxy S21 family, the Galaxy S21 FE still uses a premium glass back wrapped in a metal band. The rear glass has received a matte soft-touch finish to both reduce fingerprints and provide a more luxurious feel. The S21 FE 5G is also 0.5mm thinner than the Galaxy S20 FE at 7.9 mm thick. And yes, the device is IP68 water and dust-resistant.

The Galaxy S21 FE now uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 system-on-chip (SoC). In addition to faster performance, the SoC can accelerate AI features, especially when taking pictures. There are two memory and storage configurations: one with 6GB of memory and 128GB of storage, and another with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage.

In the camera array are a 12MP main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera, and an 8MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom or 30x digital zoom. On the front is a 32MP pinhole selfie camera.

Samsung said the S21 FE has been prepped to grab the perfect shot for social media. As such, it features multiple shooting modes, including Night Mode, Vlogger Mode, Portrait Mode and Director View multi-camera shooting mode. For editing, it can perform AI face restoration to brighten up faces and can scrub background objects using Object Eraser.

The display has received a major upgrade over the previous generation. The Galaxy S21 FE now uses a 6.3-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 120Hz refresh rate, the same technology used in the flagship Galaxy models. In addition to boasting richer colours, the high refresh rate display should provide a smoother gaming experience, not to mention silky animations and scrolling.

The phone has a 4,500mAh battery and can wirelessly share its juice with other devices. Samsung said that it only takes 30 minutes to charge for hours of use. Unfortunately, like the flagship phones, it no longer comes with a charger.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G will be available for pre-order on Jan. 5 and ship on Jan. 11. The 6GB/128GB option costs CA$950 while the 8GB/256GB configuration costs CA$1,040.","{'uri': 'itworldcanada.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ITWorld Canada'}","[{'uri': 'tom_li@itworldcanada.com', 'name': 'Tom Li', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.itworldcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SM-G990_S21FE_Green_Front_Back_RGB.jpg,0.1215686274509804,eng-7377109,False,0.7411764860153198,0.1215686274509804,378959520,1

As we saw in numerous leaks over the last few months, Samsung's latest Fan Edition device is a trimmed-down version of its flagship Galaxy S21. It offers quite a few of the same features as the flagship model, including a flagship SoC, a respectable camera setup, a high refresh rate display, and a big battery, at a slightly more affordable price. But is it worth getting over a deeply discounted Galaxy S21? Let's quickly take a look at what Samsung's new affordable flagship has to offer.

Since the Galaxy S21 FE is essentially a more affordable Galaxy S21, we'll start with taking a look at their hardware. Check out the table below for a quick comparison of the new Galaxy S21 FE and the flagship Galaxy S21.

As you can probably tell from looking at the spec table above, the Galaxy S21 FE isn't all that different when compared to the flagship Galaxy S21. It offers pretty much all the features found on the flagship device, including a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip, up to 8GB RAM, up to 256GB onboard storage, and the same connectivity features. However, the two phones aren't exactly the same. In fact, the Galaxy S21 FE does a few things better.

For instance, the device has a larger 6.4-inch FHD+ 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which some people might prefer over the vanilla Galaxy S21's 6.2-inch FHD+ 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED 2X display. It even has a larger 4,500mAh battery that offers the same fast charging capabilities as the flagship model. On top of that, the new phone has an arguably better 32MP selfie shooter. But while the Galaxy S21 FE looks to be better than the regular Galaxy S21 in these three areas, Samsung has cut some corners to keep its price low.

Speaking of cutting corners, the new Galaxy S21 FE doesn't get the same telephoto camera as the flagship model. While you do get a 12MP primary camera and a 12MP ultra-wide camera on the device, you don't get a 64MP telephoto camera. Instead, the device features a more modest 8MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and 30x space zoom.

The Galaxy S21 FE also doesn't get the same ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner as the flagship model, and it opts for a more mainstream optical in-display fingerprint scanner. But that might actually be a good thing because my experience with the ultrasonic fingerprint sensors on other Samsung devices hasn't been all that great. They're a bit too sluggish compared to the optical fingerprint scanners that the company offers on cheaper devices.

Since Samsung hasn't shared the complete RAM, storage, and USB specifications for the Galaxy S21 FE yet, we're not sure if it offers the same hardware as the flagship model. It is possible for Samsung to have opted for slower components on the Fan Edition model to keep its price low, but you'll have to wait for our full review to know if that's the case or not.

All in all, the Galaxy S21 FE packs some impressive hardware at its price point and it has the potential to replicate the Galaxy S20 FE's success. However, since it's hitting the market after a long delay, Samsung might not get the same results as last year.

One good thing about the delay, though, is that the Galaxy S21 FE ships with One UI 4 based on Android 12 out of the box. This means that it will get an additional Android OS upgrade and an extra year of security updates, which slightly increases its chances of attracting buyers. Another thing that we're sure will pique your interest in the Galaxy S21 FE is its price. Check out the section below for more details.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will be available in four colorways -- Black, White, Olive Green, and Lavender -- and it will go on sale starting January 11. Although it offers pretty much all the features that you get with the $800 Galaxy S21, it starts at $699 for the base 6GB + 128GB model.

Then join our Team! English native speakers welcome!

Samsung has lifted the lid on the Galaxy S21 FE, the long-awaited and reputedly much delayed last entry in the Galaxy S21 series. As expected, the Galaxy S21 FE has a 6.4-inch display and a Snapdragon 888, an SoC that Qualcomm has superseded with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. Incidentally, Samsung has opted against selling the Galaxy S21 FE with its in-house Exynos 2100 chipset. A choice of two memory configurations will join the last-generation SoC:

The S21 FE also has a 120 Hz panel, like the rest of the Galaxy S21 series and its predecessor. Samsung intersects the FHD+ display with a punch-hole camera too, a 32 MP sensor with an f/2.2 aperture an 81° field of view. Additionally, the device has three rear-facing cameras consisting of a 12 MP primary sensor, a 12 MP ultra-wide and an 8 MP telephoto lens. Only the primary camera is optically stabilised, though.

A 4,500 mAh battery powers the Galaxy S21 FE that it can recharge at 25 W. The device supports up to 15 W wireless charging and Samsung's Wireless PowerShare functionality. The Galaxy S21 FE is IP68 certified and measures 155.7 x 74.5 x 7.9 mm for reference. The device also weighs 177 g, yielding a footprint between the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21 Plus.

The Galaxy S21 FE starts at €749 with 128 GB of storage and 6 GB of RAM. However, the device rises to €819 if you want 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. Neither model has a microSD card slot, either. The Galaxy S21 FE will be available from January 11 in the Eurozone; the device will come pre-loaded with One UI 4.0, Samsung's version of Android 12.","{'uri': 'notebookcheck.net', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Notebookcheck'}",[],https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc3/210901_SAMSUNG_R9_5302c.jpg,0.1215686274509804,eng-7377109,False,0.8117647171020508,0.1215686274509804,378959460,1

Here's what we've all been waiting for,"Samsung may have initially planned to bring the Galaxy S21 FE to the market in the third quarter of 2021, but for reasons that aren't very clear -- though likely related to production issues and semiconductor shortages -- the phone got pushed back to January 2022. Well, it's the first week of January, and thankfully, the time of truth is finally here after countless leaks and rumors.

Samsung officially introduced the Galaxy S21 FE to the world today as the direct sequel to the Galaxy S20 FE, and a complement to the existing Galaxy S21 lineup.

According to Samsung, the philosophy that drove the development of the Galaxy S21 FE forward was to ""give Galaxy consumers more, for less."" That should be the purpose of any Fan Edition device, and the Galaxy S21 FE appears to be taking it to heart.

The Galaxy S21 FE is everything you expected it to be

The Galaxy S21 FE looks nearly identical to the base Galaxy S21 model, except it has a color-matched camera housing and metal frame. The display is flat, and the bezels are thin. The phone has a slim 7.9mm profile, stereo speakers, and an in-display fingerprint scanner.

In most regions, including Europe, the Galaxy S21 FE will ship with the Snapdragon 888 chipset, while in select Asian markets, customers will get the variant equipped with the Exynos 2100 SoC. This is a pretty big deal for customers that have always wanted to use Qualcomm chipsets in Exynos markets.

Memory options include 6/8GB of RAM and 128/256GB of non-expandable storage. The retail box is eco-friendly, meaning it uses biodegradable materials and contains as few accessories as possible. The phone is accompanied by a USB-C charging cable, a SIM card key, and the usual documentation.

The back of the phone accommodates a 12MP ultra-wide camera, a 12MP wide sensor, and an 8MP telephoto shooter, the latter of which boasts 3x optical zoom. On the opposite side of the phone, the selfie camera resides in the Infinity-O display cutout and has a resolution of 32MP.

Samsung has enhanced the Camera app with features such as Nigh Mode, Zoom Lock, AI Face Restoration, Dual Recording Mode, and Object Eraser. The Galaxy S21 FE ships with Android 12 and One UI 4.

The Galaxy S21 FE is powered by a 4,500mAh battery with 25W fast-charging capabilities -- wall charger sold separately. Samsung will release the device next week in four color options: white, lavender, graphite, and olive, though the availability of the latter two colors appears to vary by market.

""We're looking to give Galaxy fans the S21 experiences that have really resonated the most, starting at an accessible price point,"" says Stephen Hawke, Samsung's director of smartphone product strategy.

Carriers will make the effective price even lower than $699. AT&T tells us that the S21 FE will be available for $15/month on a three-year installment plan, for a total for $540. Verizon will offer trade-in discounts of up to $700, depending on what kind of phone you trade in -- and yes, you can trade in damaged phones.

Like with the S21, the S21 FE is based on last year's Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor in the US. (There will be an Exynos-based version for some other countries, Samsung confirms.)

It runs Android 12, sports an IP68 waterproof rating, and has a 6.4-inch, 120Hz 2,340-by-1,080 display with an optical fingerprint sensor underneath. The phone's three rear cameras are a 12MP 123-degree ultra-wide, a 12MP main, and a 8MP 3X zoom, while its front camera is 32MP. It comes in 6GB RAM/128GB storage and 8GB/256GB models, and its 4,500mAh battery supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging. You can choose between dark gray, green, purple, or white.

At 2.93 by 6.14 by 0.31 inches, it's a bit bigger than the standard S21, although it isn't as big as an S21 Ultra.

The phone has 5G, including both C-band and millimeter-wave 5G at the base price in the US. There will be a non-mmWave model launching in some other countries. It's also worth noting that the US model will have dual SIM slots.

In other words, it has all of the key features of a 2020 Android flagship, similar to the base-model Galaxy S21. Hawke suggests that the base S21 will now roll off of shelves, saying ""this will be the [S21] model going forward this year.""

The phone will go on sale on January 11, Samsung says.

The timing is the big question here. The Galaxy S20 FE launched in October 2020, in the middle of the pre-vaccine pandemic economic crash, following up an S20 line that we considered to be overpriced and often buggy. Buyers snapped it up.

""The Galaxy S20 FE was a huge hit for us. It was the right phone with the right features at the right price,"" Hawke says.

What a difference a year makes. The Galaxy S21 line was impeccable, to the point where Samsung's biggest problem has been making enough of them during a chipset shortage. Most people are back at work, without the economic fears of 2020. And the S21 FE is showing up in January, not October.

That means the S21 FE might have trouble differentiating itself from the upcoming Galaxy S22, which we expect will be launched next month, as well as the Galaxy A53 coming in March. That's a lot of Samsung coming at us very quickly, so it'll be interesting to see how the S21 FE fares. We'll have a review of it this week, so check back soon.","{'uri': 'sea.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag Asia'}","[{'uri': 'sascha_segan@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Sascha Segan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'his_favorite@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'His Favorite', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'texas_to_edmonton@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Texas To Edmonton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_ap/news/s/samsung-la/samsung-launches-galaxy-s21-fe-for-699_15cq.1200.jpg,0.1058823529411765,eng-7377109,False,0.8196078538894653,0.1058823529411765,378959340,1

2020's Galaxy S20 FE proved to be a hit, so a sequel was never a surprise. Now, after months of rumors, leaks, and apparent delays, the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE has finally arrived with the same specs as last year's flagships, just at a slightly lower cost.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE is a $699 device that, for the next month, will serve as a step-down offering from the Galaxy S21. Like that $799 device, the FE is made from plastic but serves as a flagship device in just about every other way.

Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888, not the newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, powers the show with either 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. There's no microSD card slot on this device. It also packs a relatively hefty battery at 4,500 mAh, bigger than what's in the base Galaxy S21. The battery can be charged over a cable at up to 25W while wireless charging hits 15W.

On the back of the phone, there are three cameras as per usual, with a 12MP primary camera, 12MP ultrawide camera, and an 8MP sensor fitted with a 3x optical zoom telephoto lens. There's also a 32MP camera on the front of the phone for selfies.

The display on the Galaxy S21 FE is a bit bigger than the Galaxy S21, with a 6.4-inch panel that hits the same 120Hz refresh rate and 1080p resolution. One key difference, though, is that this phone uses an optical fingerprint sensor instead of an ultrasonic one. NFC and IP68 water resistance round out the hardware, which will be available in four colors; Olive, White, Lavender, and Graphite. Samsung's press materials also show off a blue colorway - we've requested more details on availability for this version.

Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the Galaxy S21 FE is its software. The phone ships with Android 12 out of the box, but the same update commitment as Samsung's other flagships. That means the Galaxy S21 FE will see Android updates through Android 15, rather than stranded a version before like the Galaxy S21 series will, as Samsung confirmed in a previous press briefing. Security updates will also continue over the course of four years following the launch.

As mentioned, the price on the Galaxy S21 FE lands at $699, with the phone set to go on pre-order this week before shipping begins on January 11.

If you typically wait for the newest Galaxy S phone to launch so that you can get the previous model at a discount, you're Samsung's target audience for the Galaxy S21 FE. Samsung doesn't have any immediate plans to stop selling the Galaxy S21, which launched about a year ago. But it will position the Galaxy S21 FE as its previous-generation option once it does cycle out that series, the company said.

This isn't a new strategy. The past few years have seen a resurgence in midtier and budget phones across the industry. Even Apple revived its wallet-friendly $400 iPhone SE in 2020. But Samsung's strategy is different from Apple's in one key way. Samsung is essentially borrowing certain aspects of its mainstream Galaxy S21 phone and selling it as a midrange device. Apple, meanwhile, tends to keep older phones like the iPhone 11 in its lineup to fill that gap between its budget SE and high-end iPhones.

Similar to Samsung's first FE phone, the Galaxy S21 FE comes with features that were once reserved for more expensive phones, such as a triple-lens camera, 5G support, reverse wireless charging and a screen that can boost its refresh rate to 120Hz.

The Galaxy S21 FE is arriving as Samsung's smartphone lineup has become increasingly crowded and will likely continue to expand. The company is expected to launch the Galaxy S22 lineup in the early part of the year, just as it has done in the past. It also recently launched the $250 Galaxy A13 5G in the US and also sells other midtier phones such as the Galaxy A52 5G.

Here's a closer look at what to expect from Samsung's new midtier Galaxy phone.

CNET's Andrew Hoyle praised the Galaxy S20 FE and gave it an Editors' Choice Award for its excellent balance of performance and price. It seems like Samsung is carrying that approach forward with the Galaxy S21 FE, which appears to be a hybrid of the Galaxy S20 FE and Galaxy S21.

It has the same processor as the Galaxy S21, which means it will run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chip in the US, but otherwise has a lot in common with the Galaxy S20 FE. For example, both this year's FE phone and the 2020 version have a 4,500-mAh battery and a triple-lens camera with a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, a 12-megapixel wide camera and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens. Both the Galaxy S21 FE and Galaxy S20 FE also have a 32-megapixel front camera, which is a step up from the Galaxy S21's 10-megapixel selfie camera.

You can also expect to see a similar selection of the software-based photography features typically available on Samsung phones. In addition to night and portrait modes, there's also a tool for shooting with the front and rear lenses simultaneously. It's similar to the Galaxy S21's Director's View, but slightly different. You can't switch between the different rear lenses in addition to shooting with both the front and rear cameras on the Galaxy S21 FE as you can on the Galaxy S21.

One of the few areas in which the Galaxy S21 FE differs from the Galaxy S20 FE and Galaxy S21 is screen size. At 6.4 inches, the Galaxy S21 FE's screen is larger than the Galaxy S21's (6.2 inches), but slightly smaller than the Galaxy S20 FE's (6.5 inches). But like those two phones, the Galaxy S21 FE will support the ability to boost the refresh rate up to 120Hz for smoother scrolling.

You'll get both flavors of 5G in the Galaxy S21 (sub-6GHz and millimeter-wave), and the base model will include 6GB of memory and 128GB of storage. There's no microSD card slot, but Samsung is offering the phone in another option that comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $770.

Samsung is continuing its tradition of offering multiple color options for its new phone, although the Galaxy S21 FE won't come in as many different shades as the Galaxy S20 FE. The new phone will be available in white, graphite, lavender purple and olive green, while its predecessor came in navy blue, lavender, red, mint green, white and orange.

We can't recommend the Galaxy S21 FE until we've spent more time testing it. But it looks like a promising option for those who want a general-purpose phone with a reliable camera, solid performance and a spacious screen. At $700 in the US, it's $100 less than the current Galaxy S21 and $500 less than the top-of-the-line $1,200 Galaxy S21 Ultra.

The problem, however, is that Samsung is facing a lot of competition, even within its own product line. The Galaxy S22 is expected to launch in early 2022, and there's a chance it may only cost $100 more than the Galaxy S21 FE if Samsung sticks with its current pricing structure.

Based on Samsung's history, it seems fair to assume that the base Galaxy S22 will come with a new Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and a sharper telephoto lens than the Galaxy S21 FE. It might also come with a 50-megapixel camera sensor, according to well-known leaker Ice Universe. Significantly faster charging speeds are also a possibility, according to FronTron and Ice Universe. A more powerful processor, better camera and quicker charging could be enough to justify the extra $100 for some shoppers, possibly making the Galaxy S21 FE feel lost in the lineup.

There's also Google's $600 Pixel 6 smartphone, which is $100 cheaper than the Galaxy S21 FE. Google's latest Pixel is among the first to come with the company's new Tensor chip, which particularly shines in the device's camera. Patrick Holland gave it a CNET Editors' Choice Award for its excellent combination of elegant design, powerful performance and superb photography.

We'll know more once we've had a chance to check out the Galaxy S21 FE ourselves.

You won't get some of the costly extras found on more premium phones -- like a fourth camera lens, a crisper telephoto lens or a super sophisticated design -- but you're also not compromising by going for Samsung's cheaper option.

At the same time, the Galaxy S21 FE may end up feeling lost in Samsung's lineup and the broader Android phone market. We're expecting the Galaxy S22 to launch imminently, and if the rumors are true, it could have a new 50-megapixel camera and faster charging. Plus, the $600 Pixel 6 is slightly cheaper than the Galaxy S21 FE and was named one of our favorite phones of 2021.

We'll be updating this story as we spend more time using the Galaxy S21 FE, but here are my impressions so far.

The Galaxy S21 FE looks almost identical to the Galaxy S21 from the front. It measures 7.9 millimeters thin just like the standard Galaxy S21, despite the fact that it has a larger screen. For me, the S21 FE's 6.4-inch display and light build provide the right balance of screen space and ease of use: It's bigger than the 6.2-inch Galaxy S21 but just a hair smaller than the 6.5-inch Galaxy S20 FE, Samsung's previous-generation midrange phone.

The Galaxy S21 FE's screen uses Samsung's Dynamic AMOLED technology and has an FHD+ resolution just like the Galaxy S21. The pixel density, or number of pixels per inch, is lower than the Galaxy S21's since the S21 FE's screen is larger, but the difference isn't noticeable. Photos, games and news articles all look sharp and bold on the S21 FE's screen. It has a flat edge screen just like the Galaxy 21 and Galaxy S1 Plus, which I actually prefer over the pricier Galaxy S21 Ultra's slightly curved sides.

On the back, you'll find the same camera bump as the Galaxy S21. Both phones also have a matte finish that looks more elegant and doesn't pick up fingerprints as easily as Samsung's older phones (although it still does get smudgy, so you'll want to use a case). The Galaxy S21, however, does have some design accents that make it feel like a more expensive phone, such as the glossy metallic finish on its camera module and sides.

Though it's a nice enough phone for $700, the real problem is that Google has raised the bar for what's expected of a midtier phone. Google's $600 Pixel 6 has a gorgeous, two-tone glass design that makes it feel much more expensive than it actually is. The Galaxy S21 FE is sleek and light, but it doesn't leave the same impression.

There's also an in-screen fingerprint reader and facial authentication for unlocking the device, which I generally found to be pretty reliable. You won't find expandable storage on this model as was the case with the Galaxy S20 FE, but Samsung is selling its new phone in another variant that comes with 256GB of storage (the base model has 128GB).

Battery life was a highlight for the Galaxy S20 FE, and the Galaxy S21 FE seems to follow in its footsteps so far. Like the Galaxy S20 FE, the Galaxy S21 FE comes with a 4,500 mAh battery, which is larger than the regular Galaxy S21's 4,000 mAh battery.

The Galaxy S21 FE still had 32% of its battery left after a full day and a half's worth of usage. That's not too shabby, especially since I had the motion smoothness setting on high, which cranks the screen's refresh rate up to 120Hz. That results in faster scrolling but also typically means shorter battery life.

Samsung's new phone comes with the same processor as the Galaxy S21, which means the US version runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. That chip is found in other high-end phones like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the OnePlus 9 Pro, so the S21 FE should be able to keep up with those devices easily.

Using the Galaxy S21 FE certainly feels zippy and fluid, especially with motion smoothness turned on. The interface is slick, games run without a hitch and the camera launches within just a few seconds. Samsung also says the S21 FE supports a response rate of 240Hz for even quicker reaction times in game mode, but I haven't spent enough time gaming on it yet to tell if this really makes a difference.

The Galaxy S21 FE scored about the same as Galaxy S21 but higher than the Pixel 6 on Geekbench 5, a benchmark test meant to assess the phone's performance in general tasks. However, it scored slightly lower than both the regular S21 and Pixel 6 on a separate benchmark called 3DMark Slingshot Unlimited for testing graphics performance. Check out the results below.

Samsung's new phone comes with a triple-lens camera that's very similar to the Galaxy S20 FE's camera setup. There's a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 12-megapixel wide camera and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera with a 30x digital zoom. You can also record with the front and rear cameras at the same time on the Galaxy S21 FE similar to the Galaxy S21. But unlike the regular S21, you can't toggle between the three rear lenses when using the camera in this mode.

I haven't had much time to test out the camera. But based on the few test shots I've taken, the Galaxy S21 FE certainly seems to hold its own against the Pixel 6's 50-megapixel camera and standard Galaxy S21.

The S21 FE's images are rich in detail and color, and the camera seems to perform well in different lighting conditions. We'll have more detail on camera performance in our full review, but for now check out the samples below.

There isn't much to say about the Galaxy S21 FE other than that it's a solid phone for $700. It's another sign that the definition of a high-end phone is starting to change as once-premium features like 5G, borderless displays and multilens cameras begin trickling down to more affordable devices.

I can't issue a full verdict until I've spent more time testing the Galaxy S21 FE. But if you're an Android user looking to upgrade an older phone without spending too much, I can't imagine you'll be disappointed with it.

That being said, I'd recommend waiting until Samsung announces the Galaxy S22 lineup before making a decision. Samsung typically launches its new Galaxy S phones early in the year, and rumors suggest the next generation could come with a 50-megapixel camera and faster charging. Even if you don't need those upgrades, you might as well wait so that you can make a more informed choice.

Samsung is also facing a lot of competition in the midrange phone space. While I've been enjoying using the Galaxy S21 FE so far, I also feel that Samsung could be doing more to make this device stand out, especially against the $600 Pixel 6. Although the Pixel 6 isn't perfect, Google has done a good job of differentiating its phone with specific features built around the Google Assistant, such as the ability to have the assistant screen calls and wait on hold for you.

We're here to take a closer look at the phone's spec sheet. Needless to say, it does offer quite powerful specs.

The Galaxy S20 FE was known as the 'flagship killer' in some circles. That may not be the case with the Galaxy S21 FE considering the time of its launch, but it certainly does have compelling specs.

First and foremost, the device is fueled by the Snapdragon 888 SoC. That was Qualcomm's most powerful processor before the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 launched. The Galaxy S21 FE was supposed to launch before the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, but that didn't happen, unfortunately. The Snapdragon 888 is still plenty powerful, though.

This phone features a 6.4-inch fullHD+ (2340 x 1080) Dynamic AMOLED 2X display. That display offers a 120Hz refresh rate, and it is a flat panel. It has thin bezels, and a centered display camera hole.

Samsung decided to release two variants of the phone, one with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and the other with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. There is no microSD card expansion slot, though. Samsung didn't say which RAM and storage it's using, but we're guessing LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 flash storage.

A 4,500mAh battery is also a part of the package here. The device does support 25W wired, and 15W wireless charging. On top of that, Wireless PowerShare is also supported aka reverse wireless charging.

Android 12 comes pre-installed on the phone, along with Samsung's One UI skin. There are two speakers included on the device, one is bottom-firing (the main one), while the other sits above the display, and it's front-firing.

This phone is water and dust resistant, it comes with the IP68 certification for water and dust resistance. There is a fingerprint scanner placed under the phone's display, and it's an optical in-display fingerprint scanner.

Samsung included three cameras on the back of the phone, and one on the front. A 12-megapixel main camera (f/1.8 aperture, 79-degree FoV, Dual Pixel AF, OIS) is backed by a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera (f/2.2 aperture, 123-degree FoV). An 8-megapixel telephoto camera (f/2.4 aperture, OIS, 32-degree FoV, 3x optical zoom, 30x Space Zoom) is also included back there.

A single 32-megapixel camera (f/2.2 aperture, 81-degree FoV) sits on the phone's front side. An NFC chip is also included, and the phone supports 5G connectivity. The Galaxy S21 FE measures 155.7 x 74.5 x 7.9mm, and weighs 177 grams. It comes in Olive, Lavender, White, and Graphite colors.","{'uri': 'androidheadlines.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Headlines'}",[],https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-2-Large.jpeg,0.223529411764706,eng-7377109,False,0.5490196347236633,0.223529411764706,378958800,1

Samsung's Galaxy S21 family of smartphones -- the S21, S21+ and S21 Ultra -- is expanding with a new entry point: the Galaxy S21 FE.

As it did with the Galaxy S20 FE in late 2020, Samsung plucks some of the best features from the S21 line and places them into this smaller, more affordable device. Samsung is launching the S21 FE at CES 2022, a show where they typically focus on TVs and monitors.

The Galaxy S21 FE will be available on Jan. 11 at $699.99 for the 128GB model and $769.99 for 256GB of storage. We were able to spend a weekend with the S21 FE, and after that time we are naming it a finalist for the Best Mobile Phone from CES 2022.

The Galaxy S21 FE looks familiar, though it is slightly larger than the S21 without flashy design elements like a metal border. It is also highlighted with a camera bump that comes out of the phone's edge.

Samsung calls this a Contour-Cut frame and the subtle design provides uniformity to the back panel of the phone. The frame of the S21 FE is aluminum, though as might be expected with this more affordable option, the phone's rear panel is a smooth polycarbonate. It isn't glossy but does show some fingerprints. Weighing in at 177 grams, the S21 FE feels substantial in our hand, and it comes in Olive, Lavender, White or Graphite color options.

The device's front is nearly all screen with a 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED panel, and it's nice to see minimal bezels all-around at this price point. We also appreciate how well it handles colors, and supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother visuals than you'll see on many phones at this price. Samsung's also tucked a 32-megapixel selfie camera into the top which is great for video calls and quick shots. They've also included a fingerprint sensor built into the bottom half of the display.

Powering all of this is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, the same one that resides in the rest of the Galaxy S21 family. That means that photos are quick to process, games can be played locally or from the cloud, and multitasking is made easy by fluidly moving between apps. However, the RAM is lower than other S21s and this could lead to slowdowns with more intense tasks or just leaving a bevy of apps open. The $699 S21 FE features 6GB of RAM (what we've been testing) and the $769 variant ships with 8GB. The S21 FE comes preloaded with Android 12 and Samsung's One UX 4.0.

Battery life has also been strong throughout the weekend, likely thanks to the 4,500mAh battery inside. We've easily gotten through a full day on a charge, even making it through two with lighter usage. When it comes time to charge, you'll need to plug in the included USB-C cable or place it on a Qi-enabled wireless charging pad. Samsung doesn't include a wall plug in the box, but we'd recommend an Anker Nano II.

While Samsung's S21 FE comes with a bigger battery and a faster processor inside, the same treatment was not given to the main camera array on the back. Here's what the Galaxy S21 FE is packing.

12-megapixel ultrawide lens: The ultrawide lens offers a 123-degree field of view and is great for capturing a large area in a shot. In our early tests, we captured a ton in the frame without seeing much blur or fisheye effect around the edges. 12-megapixel wide-angle lens: The main shooter on the S21 FE performs admirably. It's best for portraits and more traditional shots. 8-megapixel telephoto lens: This is the same zoom lens as on the S20 FE and we are surprised it wasn't improved on. It's an 8-megapixel lens with 3x optical zoom functionality. 30x Space Zoom is supported here, but without the physical periscoping lens on the S21 Ultra. It's simply a combination of physical and digital zoom along with upscaling, which can lead to some serious distortion at a full 30x. We found the 10x zoom functionality to be the most practical.

Samsung's various modes are also included here -- Night Mode, Single Take, Portrait, Pro, Food, Portrait Video, Dual Recording and Slow Motion, among others, and they all run well (samples below). Single take is still one of our favorites, letting you hit the shutter button and move the phone around, then the S21 FE uses AI to figure out which shots to capture, and if it needs to apply effects.

Camera performance here will be critical, since the Pixel 6 costs just $599 and offers excellent photography. You lose the physical telephoto lens there, but Google's processing is second-to-none in the Android space.

Samsung's Galaxy S21 FE is shaping up to be an excellent new entry point into the Galaxy S21 family. However, it's launching at an interesting time as we're just a few weeks away from the rumored successors to the Galaxy S21 family, aka the Galaxy S22. Still, for those who want a more affordable Samsung device, the $699 S21 FE will likely fit the bill. As long as you're cool with a cheaper design and not the most impressive telephoto lens.

The Galaxy S21 FE is also making a splash at CES as one of the few mobile phones to launch at the show. For it's feature-set and affordable positioning, it's a finalist for Best Mobile Phone of CES 2022. We'll be sharing our full finalists later this week, ahead of the top picks in each category.

Orders open on Jan. 11 for the Galaxy S21 FE at $699.99 for 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM or $769.99 for 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Either way, you'll find support for 5G mmWave and Sub-6 as well, which is terrific news -- especially if either network exists near you. Those seeking ultra-fast speeds which can rival home networks will want to find mmWave connectivity, though it's not rolled out nationally. Sub-6 is more common, but doesn't deliver a crazy increase in speeds.

We'd also recommend looking at the standard Galaxy S21 or, if you're alright without a telephoto lens, the cheaper Pixel 6.","{'uri': 'us.cnn.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNN'}","[{'uri': 'jacob_krol@us.cnn.com', 'name': 'Jacob Krol', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-ces-badged-lead.jpg?q=w_800,c_fill",0.2470588235294118,eng-7377109,False,0.7333333492279053,0.2470588235294118,378958560,1

Rumored and leaked for some time now, the Galaxy S21 FE 5G is the ""Fan Edition"" of the Galaxy S21. The S21 FE 5G takes the best of the S21 and gives it the upgrades that, err, fans are supposedly asking for like a larger screen, higher resolution selfie camera, and a larger battery -- with a lower price starting at $699.99 ($100 less than the S21) when it launches on January 11.

""Fan features"" -- The S20 FE was a surprise hit last year thanks to its affordable price and robust set of features pulled from the S20. The S21 FE 5G looks to repeat the successful formula again.

Like the S21, the S21 FE 5G is made of plastic with an aluminum frame. The S21 FE 5G has a slightly larger 6.4-inch 120Hz AMOLED display compared to the S21's 6.2-inch screen; the resolution is the same on both phones (2,400 x 1,080).

The phone's got the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G chip and comes in the following RAM and storage configurations: 6GB RAM + 128GB storage or 8GB RAM + 128 / 256GB storage. Samsung didn't bring back the microSD card slot or the headphone jack -- womp womp. An in-display fingerprint reader is embedded under the screen.

Sharper selfies -- As far as I can tell, the S21 FE 5G's main wide lens is the same 12-megapixel shooter on the S21 with Dual Pixel PDAF and OIS. The 12-megapixel ultrawide lens should be pretty similar, too. The telephoto is the only lens that got a downgrade: 8 megapixels versus 64 megapixels on the S21. Not a big loss for most people to be honest. The S21 FE 5G's triple-lens camera system tops out at 4K / 60 fps for video instead of 8K / 24 fps, but again, not a major loss.

However, the front-facing selfie camera is 32 megapixels; the S21 only has a 10-megapixel selfie camera.

Bigger battery -- On Android phones, a larger capacity battery equals longer battery life. Samsung crammed a 4,500 mAh battery into the S21 FE 5G, which puts it right in between the S21 (4,000 mAh) and S21+ (4,800 mAh).

The S21 FE 5G still fast charges at 25W; supports 15W fast wireless charging; and can reverse charge other devices at 4.5W.

New camera tricks -- The S21 FE 5G ships with Samsung's Android 12-based One UI 4. Solid hardware aside, the S21 FE 5G's appeal might come down to the new camera software features. There's an improved night mode that supposedly takes advantage of AI multi-frame processing (up to 14 shots) to improve low-light image quality, iPhone-like studio lighting effects for portrait mode, a dual-recording mode that lets you record with both the front and rear camera at the same time (with picture-in-picture or split view), new AI that supposedly uses a ""deep-learning solution"" to improve details like ""eyebrow, hair, and lips"" texture, a ""zoom lock"" feature that improves stabilization at a higher zoom, and object eraser tool that's similar to the magic eraser feature on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.","{'uri': 'inputmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Input'}",[],https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2021/12/30/a6307546-8655-4e93-be70-b54a64170253-galaxy-s21-fe_lifestyle4.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg,0.2470588235294118,eng-7377109,False,0.6039215922355652,0.2470588235294118,378958500,1

This puts them way out of reach of many people, but Nokia is here to change that.

At CES 2022, the company has taken the wraps off several new Android smartphones. While these aren't necessarily flagship quality, they are all priced under $250 and run on Android 12 which makes them very affordable for those who want a smartphone but don't have the budget for higher-end devices or don't want to spend that kind of money.

This includes devices like the Nokia C100. This handset is priced at just $99 and will be available from Tracfone. Under the hood, it is powered by the MediaTek Helio 822 chipset. Then there is also the Nokia C200 which is slightly more expensive at $119. This phone will feature a larger 6.1-inch HD+ display and is powered by the same Helio 822 chipset.

It will be accompanied by 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and has a 4,000mAh battery under the hood.

Moving up, we have the Nokia G100 priced at $149. It will sport a 6.5-inch HD+ display and will be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 615 chipset. It features a triple camera setup, a fingerprint sensor in the power button, and is accompanied by a 5,000mAh battery, and will be available from both Tracfone and Boost.

Last but not least, there is the Nokia G400 which is priced at $239. It is powered by the SD480 4350 Pro and comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It is also 5G ready which makes the G400 one of the cheaper 5G smartphones in the market today.

There will also be a triple camera setup which consists of a 48MP main shooter, an ultrawide, and a macro camera. It also has a large display that boasts a 120Hz refresh rate and will be available from Tracfone, Boost, and Consumer Cellular.","{'uri': 'phandroid.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Phandroid - Android News and Reviews'}","[{'uri': 'tyler_lee@phandroid.com', 'name': 'Tyler Lee', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/nokia-c100-g400-3-640x359.jpg,0.1215686274509804,eng-7377735,False,0.5215686559677124,0.1215686274509804,378958320,1

The phone was originally expected to launch in the Summer of 2021, but for various reasons, Samsung was forced to delay the announcement.

CES 2022 is serving as the perfect place for Samsung to unveil its latest handset. So what does the Galaxy S21 FE have to offer?

Galaxy S21 FE Specs Display: 6.4-inch FHD+ AMOLED Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 RAM: 6GB / 8GB Storage: 128GB / 256GB Front Camera: 32MP, f/2.2 Rear Cameras: 12MP, f/1.8, OIS (main) / 12MP, f/2.2, 123-degree FoV (ultra-wide) / 8MP, f/2.4, OIS, 3x optical zoom (telephoto) Battery: 4,500mAh w/ 25W wired charging IP Rating: IP68 Software: Android 12 Extras: Fingerprint scanner / 30x Space Zoom / 120Hz Refresh Rate / NFC / 5G / 15W wireless charging / Wireless PowerShare

As expected the Galaxy S21 FE retains the look and feel of the rest of the Galaxy S21 lineup. This includes the design of the camera hump on the back, along with the hole-punch selfie camera at the top of the display.

To help differentiate the S21 FE from the rest of the lineup, Samsung is offering a couple of different colors. In addition to the black and white options, we also now have lavender and green to choose from, which match up with the colors found on the Galaxy Buds 2.

Under the 6.4-inch display, Samsung is bringing the heat when it comes to power. The Galaxy S21 FE uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chipset, the same processor found in many of 2021's best Android phones. This has been paired with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage.

Moving to the cameras, there's a triple camera setup on the back, headlined by a 12MP wide-angle lens. This is accompanied by a 12MP ultra-wide camera with a 123-degree field of view, along with an 8MP telephoto lens providing 3x optical zoom and up to 30x Space Zoom.

Samsung is also packing in some cool and useful features to help make the camera experience even more enjoyable. This includes better processing for Night Mode which will now provide more details while reducing the noise thanks to the multi-frame processing.

Similar to Google's Magic Eraser Mode on the Pixel 6, Samsung is offering Object Eraser with the Galaxy S21 FE. You'll be able to snap a picture and quickly remove any objects or people from stealing the spotlight.

Battery life should be more than adequate thanks to the 4,500mAh cell built into the phone. Unfortunately, you won't find any major improvements to charging speeds, as the S21 FE maxes out at 25W when using wires and 15W when charging wirelessly.

All of the specs look pretty great with the Galaxy S21 FE, but the biggest question that everyone will have comes down to price. Samsung will release the Galaxy S21 FE on January 11th with a starting price of $699. This may seem like a head-scratching decision, but even with stiff competition in the space, the Galaxy S20 FE performed extremely well at the same price.

We'll have to wait until we can get our hands on the Galaxy S21 FE to see how it stacks up against the competition. But it definitely looks like Samsung has another big winner on its hands, kicking off 2022 on the right foot.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will go on sale on January 11 through Samsung.com and all major service providers in North America and Europe.","{'uri': 'phandroid.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Phandroid - Android News and Reviews'}",[],https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-6-1-640x427.jpg,-0.02745098039215688,eng-7377109,False,0.7647058963775635,-0.02745098039215688,378958320,2

Although it might seem a little outdated -- we're just weeks away from the Galaxy S22, after all -- the company's latest device combines flagship performance with an affordable price point. For some buyers, that might be enough to make it more enticing than Samsung's next-gen smartphone series.

SoC Snapdragon 888 (or Exynos 2100 internationally) RAM 6GB or 8GB Storage 128GB or 256GB Display 6.4-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED (2400x1080), 120Hz refresh rate, Eye Comfort Shield Rear cameras 12MP wide (f/1.8, OIS, DPAF), 12MP ultra-wide (f/2.2, 123° FoV), 8MP telephoto (f.2.4) Front camera 30MP (f/2.2, 81° FoV) Battery 4,500 mAh (with wireless and reverse wireless charging) Software Android 12 (One UI 4) Other Optical fingerprint scanner, IP68 Dimensions 74.5 x 155.7 x 7.9mm Weight 177g Price Starts at $699.99

Compared to the rest of the S21 series, the Galaxy S21 FE is closest to the company's smallest 2021 flagship. Although it measures slightly larger -- 6.4"" vs. 6.2"" -- it's still rocking a 120Hz FHD+ AMOLED display with flat edges and a hole punch cutout for the front-facing camera. The phone's back is using the same premium plastic last seen on the S21, and although the company plans to move away from this material with its next release, we still think it's pretty great.

Design-wise, Samsung has stuck with a look that matches the rest of last year's phones, including that signature camera bump that flows right into the frame. There are four new colorways to choose from: Graphite, White, Lavender, and Olive. If you've tried out the Galaxy Buds2, all four options should look pretty familiar.

Inside the phone, Samsung is sticking with the same 5nm 64-bit octa-core processor as in the S21 series, though which CPU you get will depend on your region. In the US, it's Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888, a chip that -- despite no longer being the newest or hottest on the market -- is more than enough for everyday use. Other markets around the world will get the company's Exynos 2100 chipset in its place.

Regardless of CPU, the S21 FE pairs it with either 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage. It's all powered by a 4,500mAh battery that supports 25W wired charging and 15W wireless, complete with PowerShare for topping up your wireless earbuds or matching Galaxy Watch4.

On the back, you'll find the same 12MP f/1.8 wide and 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide lenses found on the standard S21. It also comes complete with a telephoto lens, albeit with a downgrade from 64MP to just 8MP. Thankfully, it keeps the 30x Space Zoom around, along with improved Night Mode compared to the S20 FE. Although the cameras on the S21 series didn't blow us away like the Pixel 6 managed to do a couple of months ago, they can certainly hold their own against competing smartphones.

Samsung surprised us by launching Android 12 for its pre-existing devices much earlier than most anticipated, and the S21 FE is following along as expected. It's running Android 12 with One UI 4, offering users the same great experience we already liked. Many of the best changes to Samsung's software are found under the hood, with improved privacy and security features and enhanced themes similar to Material You.

The Galaxy S21 FE will be available starting on January 11th through the usual selection of retailers and carriers. The 128GB model with 6GB of RAM is priced at $699.99, while the 256GB version paired with 8GB of RAM runs for $769.99. Although it's more expensive than competing phones like the Pixel 6, Samsung's usual discounts and trade-in offers may make it a far more enticing proposition.

Just as the Galaxy S20 FE made the company's flagship tech more affordable, the new Galaxy S21 FE, announced at CES, brings many of the specs of the successful Samsung Galaxy S21 line to a $699 phone.

""We're looking to give Galaxy fans the S21 experiences that have really resonated the most, starting at an accessible price point,"" says Stephen Hawke, Samsung's director of smartphone product strategy.

Carriers will make the effective price even lower than $699. AT&T tells us that the S21 FE will be available for $15/month on a three-year installment plan, for a total for $540. Verizon will offer trade-in discounts of up to $700, depending on what kind of phone you trade in -- and yes, you can trade in damaged phones.

Like with the S21, the S21 FE is based on last year's Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor in the US. (There will be an Exynos-based version for some other countries, Samsung confirms.)

It runs Android 12, sports an IP68 waterproof rating, and has a 6.4-inch, 120Hz 2,340-by-1,080 display with an optical fingerprint sensor underneath. The phone's three rear cameras are a 12MP 123-degree ultra-wide, a 12MP main, and a 8MP 3X zoom, while its front camera is 32MP. It comes in 6GB RAM/128GB storage and 8GB/256GB models, and its 4,500mAh battery supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging. You can choose between dark gray, green, purple, or white.

At 2.93 by 6.14 by 0.31 inches, it's a bit bigger than the standard S21, although it isn't as big as an S21 Ultra.

The phone has 5G, including both C-band and millimeter-wave 5G at the base price in the US. There will be a non-mmWave model launching in some other countries. It's also worth noting that the US model will have dual SIM slots.

In other words, it has all of the key features of a 2020 Android flagship, similar to the base-model Galaxy S21. Hawke suggests that the base S21 will now roll off of shelves, saying ""this will be the [S21] model going forward this year.""

The phone will go on sale on January 11, Samsung says.

The timing is the big question here. The Galaxy S20 FE launched in October 2020, in the middle of the pre-vaccine pandemic economic crash, following up an S20 line that we considered to be overpriced and often buggy. Buyers snapped it up.

""The Galaxy S20 FE was a huge hit for us. It was the right phone with the right features at the right price,"" Hawke says.

What a difference a year makes. The Galaxy S21 line was impeccable, to the point where Samsung's biggest problem has been making enough of them during a chipset shortage. Most people are back at work, without the economic fears of 2020. And the S21 FE is showing up in January, not October.

That means the S21 FE might have trouble differentiating itself from the upcoming Galaxy S22, which we expect will be launched next month, as well as the Galaxy A53 coming in March. That's a lot of Samsung coming at us very quickly, so it'll be interesting to see how the S21 FE fares. We'll have a review of it this week, so check back soon.","{'uri': 'pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PC Magazine'}",[],https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/060NKMjsjDTx2s56mKHwkSe-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1640885190.jpg,0.1137254901960785,,True,0,0.1137254901960785,378958020,1

But has the window for releasing this new $699 handset already slammed shut?

It's a question worth considering since the launch of the Galaxy S22 -- Samsung's next round of flagship devices -- is just around the corner. That means the Galaxy S21 FE not only invites comparisons to other Galaxy S21 models but to Samsung phones that could be in our hands as quickly as a month from now. Even smartphone shoppers holding out for the S21 FE's lower price may be tempted to wait just a little bit longer to see if the Galaxy S22 introduces significantly improved features.

That's a question that will have to wait until the Galaxy S22 makes its first appearance, which will reportedly be at a launch event in February. For now, we're left to consider the Galaxy S21 FE, a device that doesn't sacrifice too many features from the Galaxy S21 lineup, but doesn't feature as big a discount in price as you were probably hoping for.

A big part of the appeal of the Galaxy S20 FE was its price -- it debuted at a $300 discount from the Galaxy S20. But after cutting prices on the Galaxy S21 lineup last year, Samsung had a harder time offering the Galaxy S21 FE for that substantial a discount from its main flagships.

The Galaxy S21 FE starts at $699 in the U.S. That's $100 less than the Galaxy S21's debut price from last spring; depending on the Galaxy S21 deals available, you may even be able to find last year's flagship for less. Unless Samsung raises the price for the upcoming Galaxy S22 -- and it's a possibility according to rumors -- the Galaxy S21 FE won't cost that much less from Samsung's newer flagship.

The Galaxy S21 FE goes on sale a week from now on January 11. Samsung says the new phone will be widely available through carriers and retailers as well as through its own online store. We'll add carrier availability once we have that information.

With Samsung moving to its plastic-dependent polycarbonate design for the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21 Plus, there's no mystery as to what material the phone maker would use for the Galaxy S21 FE. It's plastic, and while that's not necessarily a big trade-off from the S21, there's no attempt to disguise what this phone is encased in. A haze finish on the back of the phone gives the Galaxy S21 FE a professional veneer, but no one's going to confuse this phone with a premium handset.

The Galaxy S21 FE does adopt one of the S21's better design flourishes with the contour cut design that houses the rear camera array. While there is a bump holding that strip of vertically aligned lenses, it blends seamlessly into the side of the phone, making the array seem less prominent.

I wish the sides of the Galaxy S21 FE were a little bit more prominent, though -- instead, they're fairly slick, making the phone hard to hold on to. Within a couple hours of taking possession of the Galaxy S21 FE, the phone had already slipped out of my hands a couple times, and only my cat-like reflexes kept it from tumbling to the ground.

Like the regular S21, the Galaxy S21 FE uses a fingerprint reader that's embedded under the display. An overlay that appears when the phone is locked makes the sensor easy to find, and I've certainly found it more responsive than the Pixel 6's pokey unlocking feature.

The blackish graphite color of my review unit is easily the least exciting of the Galaxy S21 FE's four color options. You can also get the phone in lavender, olive and white. Lavender's the slickest-looking option in my opinion, but your mileage may vary.

The 6.4-inch AMOLED panel on the Galaxy S21 FE is larger than the standard S21's 6.2-inch display, though a wee bit smaller than the 6.5-inch screen on the Galaxy S20 FE. The smaller panel doesn't feel particularly cramped, and I'd go so far as to say it probably makes the S21 FE easier to use with one hand than the previous model.

Like the S20 FE, the Galaxy S21 FE can support a 120Hz refresh rate, if you set motion smoothness to High in the device's Settings app. That means scrolling will look smoother on the Galaxy S21 FE's display, which leads to a better overall experience with the phone. That said, it looks like you can only toggle between 120Hz and 60Hz manually; the other phones in the Galaxy S21 lineup have adaptive displays that adjust on the fly. It's perhaps a minor distinction, but it helps explain that $100 difference with the standard S21.

Watching the Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness trailer on the Galaxy S21 FE, I thought the Sorcerer Supreme's red cape looked suitably vibrant -- well, except when he was strolling around the moodier sections of the multiverse. An episode of AP Bio streaming via the Peacock app was also bright and clear.

Our testing confirms the Galaxy S21 FE does a pretty good job with colors, as it reproduces 119.8% of the sRGB color spectrum in natural mode. That compares to 109.2% on the Galaxy S21. Both Samsung phones recorded Delta-E ratings of 0.29, so colors are just as accurate on the Galaxy S21 FE as they are on the more expensive model.

We measured the Galaxy S21 FE's display at 700 nits with Adaptive Brightness turned on. That's just shy of the Galaxy S21, which maxed out at 711 nits. And while the 795-nit iPhone 13 outshines the S21 FE, Samsung's latest phone is still bright enough to see outdoors.

Cameras haven't changed all that much on the Galaxy S21 FE when compared to the previous generation, at least in terms of hardware. As with the S20 FE, the new phone features a 12MP main camera, augmented by a 12MP ultrawide lens and 8MP telephoto lens, with the latter shooter capable of delivering a 30x Space Zoom. Even the apertures on those three lenses are unchanged from the S20 FE.

The 8MP telephoto lens looks to be the biggest trade-off between the Galaxy S21 FE and Samsung's standard flagship. Both the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21 Plus featured a telephoto camera with a higher resolution -- 64MP, specifically. While we haven't had the chance to compare zoom shots from the S21 with the Galaxy S21 FE, we'd expect the former to be noticeably sharper.

Instead of camera hardware, Samsung is choosing to focus on photography features with the Galaxy S21 FE. The phone maker says that Night Mode has been improved from what the Galaxy S20 FE offered, so that photos taken in low light should be sharper and more detailed. The S21 FE also supports Zoom Lock to keep your shots steady when you zoom in with the telephoto lens, and just like on the regular S21, you can capture video using both the front and rear lenses of the S21 FE.

Speaking of that front camera, it's got a 32MP sensor. That's an improvement on the Galaxy S21's 10MP selfie cam, and clearly an indicator of who Samsung thinks will be flocking to the Galaxy S21 FE -- a younger audience looking to post self-portraits and videos to various social networking sites.

We plan to compare the Galaxy S21 FE's camera to what some other recent flagships offer, so stay tuned to see if this new device ranks among the best camera phones.

Many of the new top-of-the-line Android phones coming out this year will run on Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, but the Galaxy S21 FE will stay a year behind with 2021's Snapdragon 888 silicon. On the bright side, the Snapdragon 888 is the same system-on-chip that powered the entire Galaxy S21 lineup, so you can expect comparable performance with those models. And the three S21 phones were among the best performing Android handsets we've tested in the last year.

You make a trade-off from the rest of the Galaxy S21 lineup when you opt for the FE, though. Samsung includes less RAM, with the 128GB base model of the Galaxy S21 FE sporting only 6GB to the 8GB found in the standard S21. That affects the ability to quickly switch between apps, though not so much that you'll notice a serious lag.

It's also reflected in the benchmark scores for the Galaxy S21 FE. When we ran Geekbench 5 on the new Samsung phone, we got a multicore score of 3,199. That's not as good as the 3,302 result the standard Galaxy S21 posted on that general performance test. The OnePlus 9, a comparably priced Snapdragon 888-powered phone that comes loaded with 12GB of RAM, posted a 3,618 score.

In graphics testing, the Galaxy S21 FE produced similar numbers to the Galaxy S21. Both Samsung phones churned out 34 frames per second in the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited test. That's also the score the OnePlus 9 produced. It's worth noting that the iPhone 13 and its A15 Bionic chip outperforms all these Snapdragon 888 devices, with a 55.9 fps result. Still, the takeaway here is that the Galaxy S21 FE can hold its own against the best Android phones.

With support for both mmWave and sub-6Ghz 5G, the Galaxy S21 FE should work just fine on any 5G network in the U.S, just like any other Galaxy S21 model.

The battery size hasn't changed for the Galaxy S21 FE; Samsung's new phone sports the same 4,500 mAh power pack as its predecessor. We haven't had the device long enough to run our custom battery test, in which we have a fully charged phone surf the web over cellular until it runs out of power, but we hope the S21 FE improves upon the sub-9 hour time posted by the Galaxy S20 FE.

Given the smaller screen size on this year's model and the improved power efficiency of the Snapdragon 888, the odds are good that the Galaxy S21 FE will deliver battery life that's closer to the average for a smartphone.

Like the main Galaxy S21 lineup, the Galaxy S21 FE supports 25W wired charging, which should take a drained battery to a 50% charge after half-an-hour by Samsung's math. You can get up to 15W speeds when you charge the Galaxy S21 FE wirelessly -- again, the same as the Galaxy S21.

There's one other charging feature the S21 FE shares with the rest of the Galaxy S21 lineup, and you probably won't like this one: there's no charger included with the phone. That's more environmentally friendly, certainly, but unless you've got a charger lying around, you're going to have to buy one separately for the Galaxy S21 FE.

The delayed Galaxy S21 FE launch has a silver lining in one regard -- you won't have to wait for an update to Android 12. Instead, the Galaxy S21 FE ships with Google's latest software already installed, along with Samsung's updated One UI 4.0 interface.

One UI 4 introduces a number of ways to customize the look of your phone's home screen, icons, wallpapers and more. Widgets get a redesign, and are more customizable, too. Samsung also adopted many of the privacy features Google built into Android 12, so that you can get alerts when an app tries to use the Galaxy S21 FE's microphone or camera. It's a better experience, overall.

We won't have a final judgement for our Samsung Galaxy S21 FE review until we've completed battery testing and get the chance to see how the phone's cameras measure up to what's already out there. On paper at least, the Galaxy S21 FE seems like a promising alternative to the rest of the Galaxy S21 lineup, even if the savings aren't as substantial as they were when the Galaxy S20 FE arrived back in 2020.

Ultimately, though, the biggest factor working against the Galaxy S21 FE could be one of timing. While this new phone is shaping up to be a solid variation on the Galaxy S21, those phones are about to make way for the Galaxy S22. And what seems like a good value now might feel outdated in just a month's time.","{'uri': 'tomsguide.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': ""Tom's Guide""}","[{'uri': 'philip_michaels@tomsguide.com', 'name': 'Philip Michaels', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C9G4trcBY5nrsCRTGLsmr4-1200-80.jpeg,0.1215686274509804,eng-7377109,False,0.7607843279838562,0.1215686274509804,378957900,1

For instance, it is powered by Qualcomm's 5nm-based Snapdragon 888 chipset, the same processor found in Samsung's best Android phones last year, specifically those sold in the U.S.

The phone sports a 6.4-inch FullHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display that features a 120Hz refresh rate for super smooth animation and gaming experience. That's slightly smaller than its predecessor's display, so it makes sense that the phone is slightly more compact than the S20 FE at 74.5 x 155.7 x7.9 mm. The S21 FE is also lighter than the previous FE model, coming in at 177g versus 190g.

It packs a 4,500mAh battery that supports 25W fast wired charging. With this capability, Samsung claims you can charge the phone by more than 50% in just 30 minutes.

Round the back, the Galaxy S21 FE includes a triple camera setup consisting of a 12MP ultra-wide shooter, 12MP wide camera, and an 8MP telephoto camera.

Its successor -- the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE -- has been reported to be under development for more than six months. Now, despite numerous rumors about Samsung ditching the Fan Edition lineup, it is finally launching the Galaxy S21 FE at a precursor event to CES 2022.

No surprises here

As pointed by the umpteen Galaxy S21 FE leaks, the smartphone largely derives its form from the Galaxy S21. Despite Samsung's efforts to offer much more competitive pricing on its 2021 flagships, the Galaxy S21 couldn't compete on price relative to its Plus and Ultra siblings. However, the Galaxy S21 FE is much more likely to remedy that issue with a more attractive $699 price as its key selling point, with some variation across carriers.

Other than its price, one thing that makes the Galaxy S21 FE a fairly attractive offering from Samsung is the Snapdragon 888 chipset, which is still powerful despite Qualcomm launching a successor last month. The chipset is bundled with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM and comes with up to 128GB or 256GB of storage. The phone gets 5G support with both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks.

Despite having the same thickness as the Galaxy S21, the Galaxy S21 FE has slightly larger dimensions and a bigger display. The 6.4-inch Full HD+ Dynamic AMOLED display offers a 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch response. The display also houses an in-display optical fingerprint scanner -- unlike the much faster ultrasonic sensor on the Galaxy S21 series.

All the hardware we already knew

Besides a bigger display, the Fan Edition phone also comes with a larger, 4,500mAh battery. In addition to the fast wired charging at 25 watts and wireless charging at 15W, the smartphone supports Wireless PowerShare -- Samsung's moniker for reverse wireless charging that will allow you to juice up batteries on wirelessly charging accessories like the Galaxy Buds 2.

When it comes to cameras, the Galaxy S21 FE has an assortment identical to the Galaxy S21. The Fan Edition smartphone retains the 12-megapixel primary wide-angle with an f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization (OIS). The 12MP ultrawide-angle camera also appears the same on paper, with an f/2.2 aperture and a slightly wider 123-degree field of view. The tertiary camera on the back is an 8MP telephoto camera that offers 3X optical zoom and up to 30X digital zoom using an f/2.4 lens setup. Samsung is also hailing 30X Space Zoom on the S21 FE, but we don't expect it to be anywhere close to the striking zoom capabilities of the Galaxy S21 Ultra's periscope zoom camera. On the front, the Galaxy S21 Ultra sports a 32MP selfie camera with an f/2.2 aperture and an 81-degree wide field of view.

Models and colors

Like the previous generation, Samsung is offering a suite of colorful options for the Galaxy S21 FE to attract young buyers. This time, you get to choose from graphite, lavender, olive, and white with a ""haze"" finish, as Samsung dubs it. The company is also marketing a ""contour-cut frame"" that blends the camera bump seamlessly with the rest of the body. Like its predecessor, the Galaxy S21 FE is also expected to be clad in ""glasstic,"" which is Samsung's name for a plastic back that has a glasslike finish. Despite its plastic back, the smartphone offers protection against dust and water with an IP68 rating.

Software

The phone will run the company's latest version of its custom skin, One UI 4 based on Android 12, right out of the box. One UI 4 gets a host of new features from Android 12, including dynamic theming, improved widgets, a privacy dashboard, and more.

Price and availability

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will be available in the U.S. starting January 11 for a price of $699 for the carrier-unlocked 128GB variant. The 256GB variant will be available for $769.

Verizon is offering a 30-month plan for $23.33 a month, along with up to $700 in trade-in credits. The prices in other regions are unknown at the time of writing, but we will update this story as more details emerge. Meanwhile, AT&T is offering a more affordable $15/month plan for the 128GB and $20/month for the 256GB variant with a 36-month agreement.

That certainly applies to Samsung, which tends to save its big mobile news for Mobile World Congress, a month or two from now. Instead, the event is more about big things: TVs, washing machines, etc.

Over the past few years, however, the electronics giant has used the show as a platform for launching its budget flagship -- again, just ahead of the launch of its...flagship-flagship S series. Over the years, Samsung has toyed around with various names for the product, including the ""Lite,"" before settling on ""FE"" -- short for ""Fan Edition."" Seems last year's device was a big success for the company. It notes, ""Since its launch in Q4 2020, Galaxy S20 FE sold 10 million units in just over a year, making it one of Samsung's best-selling Galaxy smartphones over the past year.

Ultimately, the company no doubt landed on the notion that naming a device ""Lite"" was really leading with the fact that the product was ""less than,"" from a spec standpoint. So it's positioning these devices as a kind of fan service -- offering some of the luxuries of the higher-priced devices, while dulling some of the bleeding edges in the name of keeping costs down.

For the newly announced Galaxy S21 FE 5G, that's a starting price of $699 (roughly one dollar per letter of the product's name). That's the same price point the company hit with last year's S20 -- and $100 more than Google's Pixel 6, which has catapulted to the top of the list of affordable flagships (apologies if the flagship and budget distinctions get sort of nebulous here).

""We saw an incredible response to the Galaxy S20 FE and Galaxy S21 lineup,"" says Samsung's TM Roh in a release. ""So we applied the same approach with S21 FE 5G, equipping it with the premium features that matter most to our loyal Galaxy fans -- because we're focused on delivering a smartphone that meets their most important needs.""

The handset sports a 6.4-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 processor, as its successor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, is starting rollout on flagships from companies like Xiaomi. There's a triple camera system with a 12-megapixel main, 32-megapixel ultrawide and 12-megapixel telephoto. The system comes with either 6 or 8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage, along with a solid 4,500mAh battery. And, of course, as the name implies, there's 5G on-board.

The design borrows plenty of cues from the standard S21, though the premium build has been swapped out for a lower-cost plastic construction. The S21 FE starts shipping January 11.","{'uri': 'techcrunch.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechCrunch'}",[],https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-11.jpg?w=600,0.1058823529411765,eng-7377109,False,0.5686274766921997,0.1058823529411765,378957780,1

Like the 2020 Galaxy S20 FE (the FE stands for Fan Edition), this device features most of the flagship-level specs of the Galaxy S21, including a Snapdragon 888 chipset and 120Hz display, at a lower price: $699 for the 128GB base model. With the S21's nearly midrange price tag and a compelling upper-midrange option in the Galaxy A52 5G, it's yet another addition to an already crowded spot in Samsung's lineup.

The Galaxy S21 FE offers a 6.4-inch display, slightly larger than the S21's 6.2-inch panel. Outside of that size difference, the S21 FE has a whole lot in common with the S21. Its screen is a 1080p OLED panel with 120Hz like the S21's. Even the design language is consistent, with the camera bump blending into the phone's side rails.

The FE includes a flagship-worthy 5nm chipset (Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 in the US, Samsung's own Exynos elsewhere) and a 12-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with optical stabilization, same as the S21. It even does one better on battery capacity, with a 4,500mAh cell compared to the S21's 4,000mAh (though its slightly bigger screen likely evens out battery performance). Fast 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, an IP68 weather-resistance rating, and both flavors of 5G (sub6-GHz and speedy mmWave) are all carried over from the S21.

So what does paying more for the S21 get you? More RAM -- 8GB in the base configuration versus the S21 FE's 6GB -- and a higher-res telephoto camera. Aside from the previously noted screen and battery size differences, that's about it. The Galaxy S21 FE will sell for $699 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or $769 for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It ships with Samsung's Android 12-based One UI 4.0 installed.

I've had the S21 FE in my hands for a few days, and it feels to me like a device that rides the ever-muddled line between a flagship and a midrange phone. The back is composite plastic with a matte finish, which feels midrangey to me, but the screen is big and bright with all the buttery smoothness of its 120Hz refresh rate -- flagship territory for sure. Overall performance feels flagship-worthy, too, with the exception of a little lag in the camera's portrait mode live preview. Oh, and there's no charger in the box, which is a flagship thing now, too.

Samsung introduced the S20 FE last year as a lower-cost, full-featured alternative to the S20. Also priced at $699, there was a bigger gap between it and the $999 base model S20, which made it a heck of a deal. Things are a little different this time around, with the S21 coming down in price to $799. There's also the Galaxy A52 5G, one of Samsung's higher-end budget phones for $499. And don't forget that Samsung lowered the price of admission for its foldables -- with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 priced at $999, it's part of the conversation, too.

It's more than a little confusing, but it's not a new strategy for Samsung. As Dieter noted in his overview of the S20 lineup, Samsung takes this ""a phone at every price point"" approach because it can. It also happens to be really good at mixing and matching features for different price points, and a solid support policy backing most devices makes its budget and midrange phones tough to beat. With the S21 FE, Samsung is taking yet another cut into a market that it's happily slicing thinner and thinner.","{'uri': 'theverge.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Verge'}","[{'uri': 'allison_johnson@theverge.com', 'name': 'Allison Johnson', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKyRS7WmlpJdjLCpHVB_QAHynD8=/0x170:2040x1190/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142242/ajohnson_220102_4951_0006.jpg,0.1372549019607843,eng-7377109,False,0.5960784554481506,0.1372549019607843,378957780,1

Most affordable of the S21 family, the new Android 12 phone starts at under $700 yet still manages to keep most of what makes its flagship siblings feel special.

Though you might question just where the ""Fan Edition"" phones really fit into Samsung's already-crowded Galaxy line-up, the company insists that they've already been a roaring success. The Galaxy S20 FE, for example, sold 10 million units in just over a year; indeed, since its launch in Q4 2020, it's become one of Samsung's most popular devices.

The Galaxy S21 FE's aesthetic certainly matches up to that of the regular Galaxy S21, at least before you get too close. Samsung kept the ""Contour Cut Design"" around the camera on the rear, while the simple unibody also sticks close to what we've seen before from the company's flagship. It'll come in four colors: white, graphite, olive, and lavender.

Things feel a little different once you get your hands on it, though. The rear panel is plastic rather than glass; only the display gets Gorilla Glass Victus. The edges around that Contour Cut camera section feel a little less crisp than those on, say, a Galaxy S21 Ultra. A little like, well, molded polycarbonate. Still, it's IP68 water and dust resistant.

At 7.9 mm thick and 177 grams, it's reasonably slim and lightweight. Samsung has packed in a 4,500 mAh battery, too, bigger than the regular S21's 4,000 mAh but smaller than the S21+'s 4,800 mAh. You still get fast wired (25W) and wireless (15W) charging, however, along with Wireless PowerShare.

The 6.4-inch screen falls in-between the S21 and S21+ as well, though while the FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel has a 120Hz refresh rate, it lacks the adaptive refresh on its more expensive siblings. That means the Galaxy S21 FE can't slow down the refresh for times when such high rates aren't required, in the name of saving battery life. There's also a 240Hz touch sampling rate when in Game Mode.

For chipset, Samsung has stuck with the same as you'll find in the rest of the Galaxy S21 lineup: that means a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 in the US, while other markets will get Samsung's own Exynos 2100. There's either 6GB of memory and 128GB of storage, or 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage. No microSD slot, mind.

The display has a 32-megapixel hole-punch selfie camera with an 81-degree field of view. On the back, there's a 12-megapixel wide camera with Dual Pixel AF, optical image stabilization, and an f/1.8 lens. It's alongside a 12-megapixel ultra-wide with a 123-degree field of view and f/2.2 lens, and an 8-megapixel telephoto. The latter supports up to 30x Space Zoom.

Samsung's familiar computational photography options are present and correct as well. There's Night Mode - capable of combining up to 14 shots for maximum dynamic range in low-light situations - and Zoom Lock for less hand-shake at higher magnification. Dual Recording combines video from the front and back cameras. AI Face Restoration promises better texture for eyebrows, hair, and lips, while finally, Object Eraser cuts out unwanted parts of the scene.

As for connectivity, there's WiFi, Bluetooth, and NFC, along with both Sub-6 and mmWave flavors of 5G. Out of the box, the Galaxy S21 FE will run Android 12 with OneUI 4, and Samsung is promising the same software update policy as its more expensive brethren too.

Really, as compromises go, there's a lot to like about the Galaxy S21 FE. It'll be priced at $699.99 when it goes on sale from January 11, 2022, in the US, and the Galaxy S20 FE will live on - for the moment, at least - as an even more affordable option, too. While those who can't do without the bleeding edge in phones may want to wait a little while and see what the Galaxy S22 brings to the table, it seems Samsung has cherry-picked the best of today's flagship for a much more realistic price.","{'uri': 'slashgear.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SlashGear'}",[],https://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/samsung_galaxy_s21_fe_07.jpg?w=640,0.1686274509803922,eng-7377109,False,0.6980392336845398,0.1686274509803922,378957780,1

Just as the Galaxy S20 FE made the company's flagship tech more affordable, the new Galaxy S21 FE, announced at CES, brings many of the specs of the successful Samsung Galaxy S21 line to a $699 phone.

""We're looking to give Galaxy fans the S21 experiences that have really resonated the most, starting at an accessible price point,"" says Stephen Hawke, Samsung's director of smartphone product strategy.

Carriers will make the effective price even lower than $699. AT&T tells us that the S21 FE will be available for $15/month on a three-year installment plan, for a total for $540. Verizon will offer trade-in discounts of up to $700, depending on what kind of phone you trade in -- and yes, you can trade in damaged phones.

Like with the S21, the S21 FE is based on last year's Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor in the US. (There will be an Exynos-based version for some other countries, Samsung confirms.)

It runs Android 12, sports an IP68 waterproof rating, and has a 6.4-inch, 120Hz 2,340-by-1,080 display with an optical fingerprint sensor underneath. The phone's three rear cameras are a 12MP 123-degree ultra-wide, a 12MP main, and a 8MP 3X zoom, while its front camera is 32MP. It comes in 6GB RAM/128GB storage and 8GB/256GB models, and its 4,500mAh battery supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging. You can choose between dark gray, green, purple, or white.

At 2.93 by 6.14 by 0.31 inches, it's a bit bigger than the standard S21, although it isn't as big as an S21 Ultra.

The phone has 5G, including both C-band and millimeter-wave 5G at the base price in the US. There will be a non-mmWave model launching in some other countries. It's also worth noting that the US model will have dual SIM slots.

In other words, it has all of the key features of a 2020 Android flagship, similar to the base-model Galaxy S21. Hawke suggests that the base S21 will now roll off of shelves, saying ""this will be the [S21] model going forward this year.""

The phone will go on sale on January 11, Samsung says.

The timing is the big question here. The Galaxy S20 FE launched in October 2020, in the middle of the pre-vaccine pandemic economic crash, following up an S20 line that we considered to be overpriced and often buggy. Buyers snapped it up.

""The Galaxy S20 FE was a huge hit for us. It was the right phone with the right features at the right price,"" Hawke says.

What a difference a year makes. The Galaxy S21 line was impeccable, to the point where Samsung's biggest problem has been making enough of them during a chipset shortage. Most people are back at work, without the economic fears of 2020. And the S21 FE is showing up in January, not October.

That means the S21 FE might have trouble differentiating itself from the upcoming Galaxy S22, which we expect will be launched next month, as well as the Galaxy A53 coming in March. That's a lot of Samsung coming at us very quickly, so it'll be interesting to see how the S21 FE fares. We'll have a review of it this week, so check back soon.","{'uri': 'uk.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag UK'}","[{'uri': 'sascha_segan@uk.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Sascha Segan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'his_favorite@uk.pcmag.com', 'name': 'His Favorite', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'texas_to_edmonton@uk.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Texas To Edmonton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_uk/news/s/samsung-la/samsung-launches-galaxy-s21-fe-for-699_7rjt.1200.jpg,0.1058823529411765,,True,0.6352941393852234,0.1058823529411765,378957720,1

Details of the OnePlus 10 Pro have leaked out in drips and drabs. And it seems like OnePlus plans to reveal its next flagship phone the same way.

The phone maker gave us our first official look at the OnePlus 10 Pro on Monday evening (January 3). Thanks to a steady stream of leaks surrounding the new handset, though, most of us could probably draw the phone from memory. We also know when the OnePlus 10 Pro is arriving, at least in one part of the world.

OnePlus says it will launch its new phone in China on Tuesday, January 11. There's no word on when the device will come to other parts of the world, including the U.S. Last year, the OnePlus 9 series debuted in March, so OnePlus fans outside of China might be in for a wait before the OnePlus 10 Pro comes to their market.

When it does arrive, the OnePlus 10 Pro will certainly bring a stylish look to the world of Android phones. A teaser video shows off two colors -- black and a minty green -- and the rear camera array is on a noticeably raised bump that blends into the side of the phone. That black bump stands out in particular on the green model and seems like the sort of visual flair that users will either embrace or pan.

The overall look reminds us the Galaxy S22 Ultra renders we've been seen floating around, but in this case the camera looks even more prominent while the lenses on the Samsung look more blended in with the back of the design. Samsung is expected to unveil the S22 series in February.

There's something even more significant about that camera array, though -- it carries a Hasselblad label. And the involvement of the Swedish lens specialist should be welcome to anyone eager to try out the OnePlus 10 Pro's cameras. After all, Hasselblad teamed up with OnePlus on last year's OnePlus 9 phones, and the result was the best-performing cameras we've seen on a OnePlus handset.

With the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro, Hasselblad and OnePlus focused on producing more natural color tones. There's no word on whether that will continue with the OnePlus 10 Pro or if the partnership will expand to improve other areas of this up-and-coming camera phone.

OnePlus has yet to officially reveal the complete specs for its new phone, though a OnePlus 10 Pro teaser video did confirm something we knew going into this announcement -- the phone will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. That's the latest silicon from Qualcomm, and it promises faster AI, an improved image signal processor and gaming advances as well as the usual boosts to overall speed and power efficiency.

Presumably, OnePlus will disclose additional details about the OnePlus 10 Pro as the phone's launch in China next week draws closer. Until then, we have leaked information about the OnePlus 10 Pro, which paints a pretty substantial picture of the new device.

While the OnePlus 9 phones could charge at a pace-setting 65W, the OnePlus 10 Pro is expected to introduce 85W charging to the mix. Rumors point to a bigger battery in the new phone -- 5,000 mAh compared to 4,500 mAh in the OnePlus 9 Pro.

The display on the OnePlus 10 Pro is expected to be 6.7 inches, and like its predecessor, it will refresh at 120Hz. However, a recent rumor suggests the OnePlus 10 Pro could adopt LTPO 2.0 technology, which should make scrolling even more smoother on the display.

As for those rear cameras, it sounds like they'll sport the same specs as the OnePlus 9 Pro -- a 48MP main camera supported by a 50MP super wide-angle lens and an 8MP 3x telephoto lens. The monochrome lens that came with last year's OnePlus flagship is gone, an omission we can't pretend to be broken up about. Supposedly, the OnePlus 10 Pro's front camera is getting a boost to a 32MP sensor.

We'll find out whether these rumored specs pan out just as soon as OnePlus reveals more details about the OnePlus 10 Pro. And we hope that info includes its U.S. launch plan and price.","{'uri': 'tomsguide.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': ""Tom's Guide""}","[{'uri': 'philip_michaels@tomsguide.com', 'name': 'Philip Michaels', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XXWujq8bV9cdDPwTjtbh4c-1200-80.jpg,0.0980392156862746,eng-7376935,False,0.8901960849761963,0.0980392156862746,378957600,1

The lineup is rumoured to function the vanilla Realme GT 2, Realme GT 2 Pro, and Realme GT 2 Master Edition. The sequence will probably be amongst a handful of smartphones that will probably be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC. Last month, Realme additionally launched three world-first improvements that pertain to design, pictures and communication. The Realme GT 2 Pro is confirmed to include an ultra-wide angle digicam with 150-degree subject of view and fisheye mode.

Xiaomi 12 sequence launch will be held in China at 7:30pm CST Asia (5pm IST). The launch occasion will be livestreamed by means of the corporate's China web site and Weibo.

Realme is predicted to launch the common Realme GT 2, Realme GT 2 Pro and Realme GT 2 Master Edition. A variety of focus has been on the Realme GT 2 Pro as key specs and options of the handset have been revealed by the corporate itself.

All the smartphones within the sequence are claimed to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC. The SoC may come with a brand new 'Diamond Ice Core Cooling Plus' expertise together with a supersized vapour chamber (VC) liquid cooling space to ship enhanced thermal administration. However, a report mentioned that the vanilla Realme GT 2 mannequin could include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC, which is probably going to be paired with 8GB/ 12GB of RAM and 128GB/ 256GB of storage.

The Realme GT 2 is speculated to include a triple rear digicam setup with a 50-megapixel sensor, an 8-megapixel secondary and a 2-megapixel tertiary sensor. It could function a 16-megapixel digicam for selfies. The cellphone may pack a 5,000mAh dual-cell battery with 65W quick charging help through a USB Type-C charging port.

Meanwhile, the Realme GT 2 Pro is teased to sport a 6.7-inch 2K show with skinny bezels and hole-punch cutout on the highest left nook of the display screen. Realme confirmed that the cellphone will get a Samsung panel with a decision of 1,440×3,216 pixels and a 120Hz refresh fee. It can have LTPO expertise, and Gorilla Glass Victus safety. One of the options could possibly be a fingerprint sensor with ""Heart Rate Detection"".

Furthermore, the Realme GT 2 Pro is claimed to are available two variants: 8GB RAM + 256GB storage and 12GB RAM + 256GB storage. It could possibly be supplied in Master Paper and Master Mysterious (translated) color choices.

As far because the digicam specs of the Realme GT 2 Pro are involved, the smartphone (*2*) a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 major digicam with optical picture stabilisation (OIS). The second sensor within the triple rear digicam setup is probably going to be a 50-megapixel one, and will probably be paired with a lens that gives a 150-degree field-of-view. Additionally, the handset may also get a fisheye mode. The final two options are confirmed to be current on the iQoo 9 Pro.

After backing out of an in-person event at CES, OnePlus set the official launch of its OnePlus 10 Pro flagship phone for late next week.

The OnePlus 10 Pro will be the first major US Android flagship of the year, and will almost certainly be the first US phone to launch with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, which we saw demoed last month at a major Qualcomm event.

The phone will officially launch in China at 1 a.m. ET on Thursday, Jan. 11, the company says. OnePlus has assured us that the phone will launch in North America as well. Although it didn't specify a date, price, or carriers, OnePlus has a very strong relationship with T-Mobile.

OnePlus's typical strategy is to dribble out teasers in advance of a phone launch, so we should expect more details this week.

The initial official image shows a phone with three main rear camera lenses, and the insignia ""P2D 50T"" on the camera flash. The phone comes in green and black, and has the traditional sliding OnePlus lock switch. With the name ""OnePlus 10 Pro 5G,"" you know it'll have 5G. There's nothing about a lower-cost, non-Pro model.

Otherwise, you have to turn to the leaks and rumors to know more about the phone. We know it will use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor. TechRadar tips a 20:9, 120Hz, 6.7-inch 3,216-by-1,440 LTPO OLED display. The site also claims the phone will have similar cameras to the OnePlus 9 Pro, with a 48MP main camera, 50MP ultra-wide and 8MP telephoto, at either 3.3x or 5x zoom. If that's the case, OnePlus will have to tell a strong story to differentiate the new phone from the OnePlus 9 Pro.

GSMArena reports that the phone will have 80-watt fast wired charging. It will probably be branded as Oppo's VOOC technology. Oppo offers that at up to 125W.

The greatest concerns and questions around the OnePlus 10 Pro aren't about the hardware, though. They're about the software and strategy.

In 2021, OnePlus finally merged with Oppo, with CEO Pete Lau taking a position at both brands and saying they're working toward a merged software platform. But the results so far have been far from his old promises of a ""burdenless"" experience.

The OxygenOS 12 update for the OnePlus 9 Pro was deemed ""awful"" by Android Police and eventually yanked from the market. Android Police also notes that the new Oxygen/ColorOS just feels like a ""Chinese"" Android skin -- a busy look, clunky animations, aggressive sounds, and a more ""maximalist"" aesthetic than the minimalism preferred by US tech fans.

For years, OnePlus's OxygenOS was marked by a balanced minimalist UI backed up by a thrilling set of low-key customization options. That helped pull tech fans who felt Samsung and LG had too heavy a hand away from those bigger players into OnePlus's orbit.

If OnePlus has gone full Oppo, it's aligning with a much bigger brand. Globally, Oppo has sold far more phones than OnePlus has. But in the US, OnePlus's flagship identity is tied to its fast, elegant software. Abandoning that pushes the impression of OnePlus downmarket. We'll see whether the company can rescue that at its official launch on Jan. 11.","{'uri': 'sea.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag Asia'}","[{'uri': 'sascha_segan@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Sascha Segan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'his_favorite@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'His Favorite', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'texas_to_edmonton@sea.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Texas To Edmonton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_ap/news/o/oneplus-10/oneplus-10-pro-launches-on-january-11-heres-the-first-offici_ys42.1200.jpg,0.1450980392156862,,True,0,0.1450980392156862,378957000,2

OnePlus also would not say when the phone would be arriving in the US or to other markets outside China.

Rumored specs for the 10 Pro include a 6.7-inch QHD Plus display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 CPU, 12GB of RAM, support for 5G networks and a 5,000-mAh battery.

As for cameras, the three rear lenses are expected to be a 48-megapixel primary shooter to go with a 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle and 8-megapixel telephoto.

OnePlus founder Pete Lau said in September that the new phone will run on a new unified operating system that combines its Android-based OxygenOS with Oppo's ColorOS.

Oppo and OnePlus (alongside a bevy of other phone brands) are both subsidiaries of Chinese conglomerate BBK Electronics. The two subbrands have gotten significantly closer over the last couple of years.

Rumors and leaks about the OnePlus 10 Pro have surfaced recently, but the company has kept quiet officially until now. With CES 2022 just around the corner, the excitement is building.

As it did with the OnePlus 9 series of smartphones, OnePlus has partnered with renowned camera brand Hasselblad. For decades, Hasselblad has produced some of the finest camera equipment money could buy, making things look real good for the trio of camera lenses we can see on the rear of the OnePlus 10 Pro.

While the Chinese tech firm hasn't officially announced the specs for the phone, we can confirm one thing. In official release videos for the handset, we see the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 mobile processor prominently on display. Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon is built on a 4nm manufacturing process and offers huge improvements in gaming and AI for Android phones.

That, unfortunately, is all we can tell for certain about the internals of the device. While we do get a bird's eye tour of the inside of the OnePlus 10 Pro, there aren't any visible markings on the other components.

Except for one. In the video and official release photos of the smartphone, we see the three rear-facing cameras, along with what appears to be a sensor of some sort. The sensor bears the markings P2D 50T, but OnePlus has not confirmed as of this writing what the sensor's function is.

The rear-facing camera system still exists as a protrusion from the chassis, albeit differently designed. We can see the alert slider just to the left of the camera lenses, on the side of the device. Below that is a single button, likely the power/sleep/wake button. One the other side, you'll find the device's volume buttons.

From the included product photos, it appears OnePlus will make the 10 Pro available in black and green. If there are other color options in the works, OnePlus hasn't mentioned them. The device appears to be crafted from polished metal, but the rear case looks textured.

We'll have to wait for more official word from OnePlus about all of those nitty gritty details. Chances are, we won't have long to wait.

The teaser image accompanying the announcement shows the rear design of the phone, including the large camera module on the back. The OnePlus 10 Pro will be available in Green and Black colours, though there may be some market-specific hues later on.

OnePlus 10 Pro will be the first phone from the company to ship with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen1 chipset.

OnePlus 10 Pro can be seen in Green and Black colour options in the teaser. It has a large, rectangular module on the back to house the phone's triple cameras and LED flash. There's a mention of 50T and P2D on the LED flash ring. The Alert Slider and power button are on the right spine. The back panel is curved towards the edges. Antenna lines on the sides are visible as well. Since the company has started teasing the design officially, we expect more details to come our way over the next week.

OnePlus 10 Pro is said to sport a 6.7-inch QHD+ AMOLED LTPO 2.0 display with a 120Hz refresh rate, Corning Gorilla Glass layer, and a punch-hole cutout. The handset houses triple cameras on the back, with a 48MP primary sensor, a 50MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and an 8MP telephoto lens with 3X zoom.

The phone will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen1 chipset paired with up to 12GB RAM and 512GB storage that may not be expandable. It is likely to boot Android 12-based OxygenOS custom skin on top. The OnePlus 10 Pro is said to rock a 32MP camera on the front for selfies and video chats.

The phone's image shows a Hasselblad camera at the back, which was also seen on the previous OnePlus 9 Pro series. The camera arrangement at the back is, however, different compared to the previous iteration of the device. Green and black colour options are seen for the device, and it has a matte finish at the back with the OnePlus symbol as well.

OnePlus 10 Pro will of course be powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, which the company had confirmed a while back. However, other specifications and details about the device have not been revealed so far. OnePlus has also not confirmed the exact launch date for the new series, though it will take place this month.

OnePlus CEO Pete Lau had in an earlier Weibo post confirmed that the phone will come with an LTPO 2.0 display (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide), which will help deliver a smoother user experience. LTPO 2.0 will allow the phone to have a much smoother scrolling and visual experience. The phone will have an adaptive refresh rate of 1Hz to 120 Hz, which was also seen in the previous generation.

The OnePlus 10 Pro will run the flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. The same chipset is also expected to power the OnePlus 10 variant, though that version is yet to be announced. The display size will likely be 6.7-inches and this will have a QHD+ resolution.

The phone will start at 8GB RAM likely and go up to 12GB RAM options as we have seen in the past. It remains to be seen if OnePlus decides to bump up the RAM to 16GB for the new phones. The storage will likely start at 128GB and go up to 256GB or higher.

On the camera front, a 48MP and 50MP camera are expected. As seen in the photo, this is a triple camera and the third camera is likely a telephoto lens, though camera specifications are yet to be confirmed. Leaks have also talked about how OnePlus could improve the fast charging on the device and give a bigger 5000 mAh battery for the phone.

In other news, OnePlus has confirmed that the OnePlus 9RT will launch in India on January 14. The OnePlus Buds Z2 will also be launching at the same day. The device has already launched in China.","{'uri': 'indianexpress.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}",[],https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/01/OP10PRO_NEW.jpg,0.0980392156862746,eng-7376935,False,0.8549019694328308,0.0980392156862746,378955020,1

After backing out of an in-person event at CES, OnePlus set the official launch of its OnePlus 10 Pro flagship phone for late next week.

The OnePlus 10 Pro will be the first major US Android flagship of the year, and will almost certainly be the first US phone to launch with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, which we saw demoed last month at a major Qualcomm event.

The phone will officially launch in China at 1 a.m. ET on Thursday, Jan. 11, the company says. OnePlus has assured us that the phone will launch in North America as well. Although it didn't specify a date, price, or carriers, OnePlus has a very strong relationship with T-Mobile.

OnePlus's typical strategy is to dribble out teasers in advance of a phone launch, so we should expect more details this week.

The initial official image shows a phone with three main rear camera lenses, and the insignia ""P2D 50T"" on the camera flash. The phone comes in green and black, and has the traditional sliding OnePlus lock switch. With the name ""OnePlus 10 Pro 5G,"" you know it'll have 5G. There's nothing about a lower-cost, non-Pro model.

Otherwise, you have to turn to the leaks and rumors to know more about the phone. We know it will use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor. TechRadar tips a 20:9, 120Hz, 6.7-inch 3,216-by-1,440 LTPO OLED display. The site also claims the phone will have similar cameras to the OnePlus 9 Pro, with a 48MP main camera, 50MP ultra-wide and 8MP telephoto, at either 3.3x or 5x zoom. If that's the case, OnePlus will have to tell a strong story to differentiate the new phone from the OnePlus 9 Pro.

GSMArena reports that the phone will have 80-watt fast wired charging. It will probably be branded as Oppo's VOOC technology. Oppo offers that at up to 125W.

The greatest concerns and questions around the OnePlus 10 Pro aren't about the hardware, though. They're about the software and strategy.

In 2021, OnePlus finally merged with Oppo, with CEO Pete Lau taking a position at both brands and saying they're working toward a merged software platform. But the results so far have been far from his old promises of a ""burdenless"" experience.

The OxygenOS 12 update for the OnePlus 9 Pro was deemed ""awful"" by Android Police and eventually yanked from the market. Android Police also notes that the new Oxygen/ColorOS just feels like a ""Chinese"" Android skin -- a busy look, clunky animations, aggressive sounds, and a more ""maximalist"" aesthetic than the minimalism preferred by US tech fans.

For years, OnePlus's OxygenOS was marked by a balanced minimalist UI backed up by a thrilling set of low-key customization options. That helped pull tech fans who felt Samsung and LG had too heavy a hand away from those bigger players into OnePlus's orbit.

If OnePlus has gone full Oppo, it's aligning with a much bigger brand. Globally, Oppo has sold far more phones than OnePlus has. But in the US, OnePlus's flagship identity is tied to its fast, elegant software. Abandoning that pushes the impression of OnePlus downmarket. We'll see whether the company can rescue that at its official launch on Jan. 11.","{'uri': 'in.pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PCMag India'}","[{'uri': 'sascha_segan@in.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Sascha Segan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'his_favorite@in.pcmag.com', 'name': 'His Favorite', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'texas_to_edmonton@in.pcmag.com', 'name': 'Texas To Edmonton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_in/news/o/oneplus-10/oneplus-10-pro-launches-on-january-11-heres-the-first-offici_admy.1200.jpg,0.1450980392156862,eng-7376935,False,0.7803921699523926,0.1450980392156862,378955020,2

OnePlus usually debuts its new flagship phone in the spring. But this year, the company is switching it up: OnePlus is revealing the new One Plus 10 Pro in Las Vegas this week prior to the flagship's official launch in China on Jan. 11.

While OnePlus has yet to release official specs and pricing, today at CES OnePlus has provided the first official photos showing off the OnePlus 10 Pro's design, which is a notable departure from the OnePlus 9 and 9.

Instead of the shiny mirror finishes OnePlus used on the OP9, the OP10 Pro sports a more low-key two-toned aesthetic with a matte finish (available in green or black) highlighted by a large rear quad camera module that once again bears some prominent Hasselblad branding.

While details are light thus far, there are a couple of things we can glean from these images. First is the lack of a rear or side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which implies the use of an in-screen fingerprint reader, along with continued support of OnePlus' traditional alert slider on the side. The phone looks rather fetching, though the camera module's shape and placement are quite reminiscent of Samsung's Contour Cut design on the Galaxy S21. Small kudos to OnePlus for making an attractive phone, but minus a couple points for originality.

However, the main question we have about the OP10 Pro is about its fourth rear camera, which on top of not looking like a typical camera lens also bears a label saying ""P2D 50T."" Currently, without any additional info from OnePlus, it's unclear what the true nature of this fourth camera will be, but based on previous comments from OnePlus co-founder and CEO Pete Lau, who said he wants to improve the cameras on OnePlus phones, this P2D cam looks to be the big feature that attempts to set the OP 10 Pro apart from other flagship smartphones.

My current guess is that P2D is OnePlus' name for a new type of autofocus system, which uses that fourth camera as dedicated focus sensor instead of being a regular camera. That said, I also wouldn't be surprised if that 50T stands for a 50x zoom or maybe a 50x macro. Who knows, maybe it's both (or even all three).

The other little tidbit we can glean from OnePlus's newly released teaser video (seen above) is that the phone will be powered by Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip, which will likely be the dominant processor used in most high-end Android phones this year.

This somewhat unusual announcement timing, the OP10 Pro's new design, and the phone's new fancy camera element indicate that 2022 could be the year when OnePlus finally believes it can truly take on the other big Android phone makers like Samsung and Google.

Over the past few years, OnePlus phones have been getting steadily more expensive as OnePlus has added more features and extras to better compete with other flagship devices. And while last year's OP9 came close, it didn't quite live up to other high-end Android phones, particularly when it came to low-light photos.

We expect to hear more about the OnePlus 10 Pro later this week at CES prior to the flagship's official launch in China next week, so stay tuned.","{'uri': 'gizmodo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gizmodo'}",[],"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/38fbf43780f9119b17f97c653d64a821.jpg",0.1137254901960785,eng-7376935,False,0.7960784435272217,0.1137254901960785,378954420,1

With hAIsten AI, it is therefore possible to deploy AI with just a single click, the company claims.

The new tool is a software-as-a-service offering that aims to speed up AI development, and will be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show on Jan. 5, the company said.

As Avalanche explains, AI deployment can be a time consuming process, with some models taking more than a year to get into production. The process involves numerous skilled data scientists, engineers, domain experts and managers, and even once a model has been moved into production, developers face a lot of work just to keep them up and running.

This traditional AI development process eats up massive amounts of time and money, creating a huge barrier to entry for small businesses, which means they're trailing behind larger entities that have deeper pockets.

Avalanche wants to change that dynamic, and says hAStien AI's low-code AI software leverages multi-GPUs to speed up AI development and training. The company claims it can shorten AI development cycles from years to just months.

Other features in hAIsten AI include the ability to test multiple algorithms within shorter time frames, one-command AI model deployment, plus a real-time dashboard to monitor model training status and manage all models in one place. Avalanche says teams will be able to use hAIsten AI to create new AI applications with just a few clicks, making the technology more accessible for all companies.

Avalanche co-founder and Chief Executive Jay Chen promised that hASten AI will ""revolutionize how data scientists train their algorithms"" and create ""more parity in the AI development space.""

The company said hAIsten AI supports model training and deployment on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, in addition to edge devices powered by OpenVino, Nvidia Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. hardware.","{'uri': 'siliconangle.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SiliconANGLE'}",[],https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2022/01/avalanche.jpg,0.1843137254901961,eng-7377095,False,0.7803921699523926,0.1843137254901961,378952740,1

Why IoT ExpressLink was the big news from AWS Re:Invent: This is a story I wanted to write based on conversations with a few IoT platform folks who build on AWS, but I never got around to it leading into the holiday. I say this so y'all will run over and read why the launch of IoT ExpressLink is such a big deal, including understanding why Amazon is betting big on machine identity to build trust in the IoT. Incidentally, machine trust is also why I think the blockchain will be so essential for the internet of things as well. (VentureBeat)

Is it the how or the what that makes something creepy? This story about Fitbit (now owned by Alphabet) filing a patent for developing games as a way to assess mental acuity and dementia risk portrays it as a less-creepy alternative to using voice analysis for the same tasks. But I think in this case, it's not how a tech giant measures mental acuity that is creepy, but that it wants to gather this information at all. I've been thinking a lot about how tech firms can use IoT and AI to help people without being creepy, and it's becoming clear that until they change their business models to selling tech from selling eyeballs, they probably can't. By this I mean that if my doctor wanted to prescribe some games on my Fitbit to test my risk of dementia or Parkinson's, I'd probably do it, because I trust that my doctor is incentivized to care about my overall health. Thus Alphabet should try to provide tools to the medical world that can assist in their jobs, not develop a parallel diagnostic track that seems to elicit disinterest from doctors and privacy concerns from users.

I like these startups: Y'all may recall that for me, most of the 5G hype is still hype, and while I think the lower latency offered by 5G will eventually find a home in factory settings, we are not there yet. But I will keep an eye on these four startups highlighted by Verizon that are using 5G for manufacturing use cases. The use cases involve wayfinding, a robotic arm, computer vision for tracking safety violations, and robotic vehicles. (Verizon)

Speaking of 5G...: When we talk about 5G, we tend to focus on the capacity or the low latency, since you can send massive amounts of data over some swaths of spectrum used for 5G and low latency is built into the standard. But Qualcomm has written a blog post explaining how the technology can also deliver ultra-accurate positioning in areas where GPS or other satellite options might fail. Positioning is built into upcoming releases of the 5G radio standard; it's made possible by the fact that 5G requires a lot of antennas with ultra-narrow beams. Those can be used to calculate angles of arrival for very close distances, which gives ultra-precise location. My hunch is that 5G will require more battery and more CPU power than other methods, but for use cases where location is important, it's going to find a home. (Qualcomm)

Here come the Wi-Fi HaLow devices: The Wi-Fi Alliance certified the long-range, low-power Wi-Fi HaLow standard in November, and now we're seeing sensors and gateways designed to use the tech. Deviceworx, a company that makes sensors and gateways, and Newracom, a company that makes systems on a chip, have announced products designed to work with the Wi-Fi HaLow standard for the industrial sector. These products will ship in Q2 of 2022, and I can't wait to see how demand shapes up for this version of Wi-Fi designed specifically for the IoT. (Newracom)

IoT security firm Claroty purchased a medical device security company: Claroty, fresh on the heels of raising $400 million for IoT security, has now purchased a startup called Medigate. Medigate makes custom software for health care practitioners and clinical environments. Hospitals are currently a popular target of ransomware, but in addition to taking down IT departments, security breaches could also infiltrate connected medical devices and directly affect patient care. That hasn't publicly happened, yet, but every health care IT worker has a tale to tell about unpatched Windows machines on medical equipment or vulnerabilities found in monitoring equipment. The Medigate purchase gives Claroty, which is known for its OT security monitoring expertise, an entry point into the health care market. (IoT World Today)

Why not embrace some predictions? I loathe year-end prediction coverage, and now that I don't have to listen to an editor, I generally don't do them. But people like them, so I thought I'd share some published predictions that jibe with my own (if I were willing to write them down). Most of these are pretty obvious, but that does make them more likely to happen. In fact, they are mostly all happening right now and I predict they will continue to expand in the coming year.

Two perspectives on web3: Look, I get that we're all hyped up about web3 or Web 3.0 or whatever we're calling this conflation of decentralized ledgers, computing, and creation, and I'm down for that. But honestly, when everyone still has a different definition of something, it's hard to talk about it, much less figure out how it might fit something as broad as the internet of things. So I figured I'd share two perspectives that have me getting closer to understanding. If you want a definitive take from someone who has bought into the web3 concepts, @gillesdc is the one to read. If you want less propaganda and someone asking good questions and bringing up facets of the conversation worth having before we start making definitive predictions, Tim O'Reilly is your man.

The Dimensity 9000 represents the first time in a while that the chip-maker is really trying to trade bouts with the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung in the flagship space. And while we're still expecting the majority of smartphones to ship with Snapdragon chipsets, the fact that MediaTek has a proper flagship product should diversify the high-end smartphone chip space a little, especially in Asia. One company that might put its trust in the Dimensity 9000 is OnePlus, as new rumors discus plans to build a phone using the chip -- and it might be a variant of the OnePlus 10.

The OnePlus 10's non-Pro variant will run a MediaTek Dimensity 9000 chip, according to a report published today by MySmartPrice. Supposedly the Pro model would run a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, and while the non-Pro version has largely been absent from the leak cycle, it was expected that it would also feature the same chip, given how that was the norm for OnePlus with previous devices. This source points out that we might not see a OnePlus 10R this year, and that the OP10 could instead fill that market segment (the OnePlus 9R was succeeded by the 9RT).

This wouldn't be the first time OnePlus introduces a MediaTek-powered phone -- the OnePlus Nord 2 famously launched with a Dimensity 1200 chipset. Up until this point, though, all of its flagship phones have debuted with Snapdragon chipsets -- and prior to the launch of the Nord 2, this included mid-range phones too. The Dimensity 9000 is up in a similar class with Qualcomm's latest offerings, and OnePlus might want to give it a shot in its cheaper 2022 flagship, set to come later this year.

After an entirely virtual edition in 2021, CES 2022 is set to be a hybrid event. While many startups will be present on site, most of the biggest and hotly anticipated brands will unveil their new products via online events. This year's Consumer Electronics Show runs Jan 5 to 7 in Las Vegas, ending one day earlier due to Covid-19 restrictions.

The 2022 edition of CES is expected to see few in-person events and a host of online presentations. Originally, more than 2,200 exhibitors were expected to attend the show on site, but some of the biggest names in the business have already announced that they will not be attending in person.

This is the case of Intel, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Lenovo and T-Mobile, but also BMW, Mercedes or Waymo on the automotive side. So, after an entirely virtual edition in 2021, this year's event will largely be followed through various online conferences and presentations.

For those who opt to remain on site, strict measures will be taken to prevent the spread of covid-19, including mandatory masks and vaccination.

Whether on site or remote, all the exhibitors at CES 2022 will have something interesting to present. As usual, it's the TVs product sector that promises some of the most spectacular announcements. Samsung, LG and Panasonic all have events scheduled to showcase their latest technologies. The Chinese company Hisense will also present its new products, in what promises to be an important year for the company, as the manufacturer is one of the main sponsors of the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Qatar at the end of 2022.

On the audio side, Harman is expected to present many new products, especially for its JBL brand, which recently celebrated its 75th anniversary. Meanwhile, Sony is expected to present new headphones.

The health sector will be strongly represented this year, with more than 100 startups on the bill. Covid-19 will obviously be on the agenda, with, for example, the demonstration of a first airborne detector of the virus, as well as various tools for simulating its spread.

Finally, the organisers have announced the presence of Cristiano Amon (Qualcomm), Jong-Hee Han (Samsung), Mary Barra (GM) and Pete Buttigieg, the US Secretary of Transportation. - AFP Relaxnews","{'uri': 'thestar.com.my', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Star '}",[],https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/01/04/1430441.jpg,0.09019607843137245,eng-7377356,False,0.43529412150383,0.09019607843137245,378948000,1

A easy approach to enhance sound high quality is by supporting superior Bluetooth codecs, which permit for extra information to be transferred between the supply machine and earphones, leading to richer sound. Lypertek, a small audio specialist model that focuses on true wi-fi earphones, has gone a step additional with a hybrid triple-driver setup.

Following the superb Lypertek Tevi is the most recent product from the corporate, the Lypertek PurePlay Z7, which is priced at Rs. 15,999 in India. This pair of true wi-fi earphones has a hybrid triple-driver setup in every earpiece and Bluetooth 5.2 with assist for the Qualcomm aptX Adaptive codec, making it a formidable choice on paper. So is that this the perfect sounding pair of true wi-fi earphones for lower than Rs. 20,000? Find out on this overview.

The Lypertek PurePlay Z7 has bodily buttons on the earpieces for controls

The design of the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 is very like that of the Tevi, with large, cumbersome earpieces and bodily buttons for controls. I bought a correct in-canal match with the Lypertek PurePlay Z7, and I discovered the earpieces comfy. However, their sheer dimension might be a bit unsettling for some individuals. They look a bit awkward when worn, and I used to be continually apprehensive about them falling out after I wasn't sitting down.

Physical buttons as an alternative of touch-sensitive zones are a bit bothersome, notably on a premium headset similar to this. Pressing the buttons on the Lypertek PurePlay Z7's earpieces typically shook their already precarious slot in my ears. The controls themselves are straightforward to be taught and get used to, and canopy the fundamentals of performance together with playback and quantity adjustment.

A press on both facet performs and pauses music; a double-press adjusts the amount up or down relying on whether or not you press the left or proper earpiece; and a triple-press skips to the earlier or subsequent observe. A protracted-press on the fitting invokes the default voice assistant in your smartphone. All of those are the default controls, and might be modified utilizing the app.

The earpieces are rated IPX5 for water resistance. The gross sales bundle features a USB Type-C cable for charging, small mud covers for the earpiece shops, three pairs of silicone ear suggestions, and three pairs of froth ear suggestions in numerous sizes. Although I do normally like foam ear suggestions, those within the bundle did not give me an excellent match, and I most popular how the silicone ones felt.

The charging case is just like that of the Lypertek Tevi, with a fabric-wrapped exterior and Lypertek emblem on the high, however it's a good bit longer. The case holds the fairly massive battery, and has a USB Type-C port for charging and a small indicator gentle on the entrance. There's additionally Qi wi-fi charging. While the case was a bit too massive to comfortably slot in my pocket, the extra battery capability was a helpful trade-off. The charging case dies look good, however the earpieces nonetheless look a bit too odd for the worth.

The Lypertek PurePlay Z7 works with the PureControl app on each iOS and Android. This app lets you modify the controls, regulate the equaliser, activate the LDX audio mode (extra on that later), and regulate a couple of different fundamental settings on the headset. Most capabilities work high-quality even with out the app, so you do not essentially must have it put in.

The triple-driver setup on the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 options two balanced armature drivers and one dynamic driver in every earpiece

The Lypertek PurePlay Z7 has a hybrid triple-driver setup, consisting of two balanced armature drivers and one dynamic driver in every earpiece. The frequency response vary is 20-20,000Hz. There can also be Bluetooth 5.2 for connectivity, with assist for the Qualcomm aptX and aptX Adaptive Bluetooth codecs, in addition to Qualcomm cVc 8.0 environmental noise cancellation for voice. There is not any energetic noise cancellation on the PurePlay Z7, however there's a fundamental hear-through mode to permit some ambient listening by the in any other case isolating in-canal match.

Battery life on the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 is superb, with the earpieces operating for round 8 hours per cost with the Qualcomm aptX Adaptive codec in operation at average quantity ranges. The charging case added an extra six full prices to the earpieces, for a complete battery lifetime of effectively over 50 hours per cost cycle.

On any sort of headphones or earphones, good {hardware} is the first issue that ensures competent audio efficiency, and the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 is suitably outfitted. However, these earphones will carry out higher with an Android smartphone that helps the aptX Adaptive and aptX codecs in operation.

The Lypertek PurePlay Z7 is designed primarily across the music listening expertise, versus all-rounders which may additionally prioritise two-way voice communication. Bluetooth connectivity was steady as effectively, and audio efficiency with high-resolution audio tracks from Apple Music was nearly pretty much as good as you may anticipate from a pair of true wi-fi earphones.

Starting with Voyager by Daft Punk, the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 provided the sort of sonic signature you may anticipate from a multi-driver setup; there was element, definition, and cohesiveness throughout the frequency vary on this soothing, but catchy digital observe. Each a part of the vary sounded distinct, with the three drivers ably sharing the load. The drivers are tuned for music, and reacted effectively to the continually altering really feel of the observe. The lows and bass, dealt with by the only dynamic driver in every earpiece, sounded tight, aggressive, and fantastically refined.

Battery life on the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 is great, with over 50 hours of listening time per cost cycle

With the gradual however haunting Need Your Heart (Minnesota Remix) by Adventure Club, the interaction between the three drivers was at its best, and the deep bass of this dubstep observe felt partaking and powerful. The mid-range and highs, dealt with by the balanced armature drivers, had been equally distinct and cohesive; by no means held again even by the highly effective lows because of the distinctive nature of the hybrid triple-driver setup.

With its wonderful tuning and driver setup, the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 made for spectacular ranges of element. Listening to Let's Groove by Earth, Wind & Fire, it was doable to listen to even the faintest components on this observe with stunning precision, all whereas the punchy lows and fast beats continued to rightly be on the centre of the listening expertise. Indeed, it is a healthful sound that covers every part with pure sonic signature in addition to spectacular element and drive.

On the draw back, I had fairly a couple of points with the Pure Control app on each iOS and Android. It typically didn't detect the headset even when correctly paired and linked. That stated, the app provided no important worth or utility after the preliminary setup course of. LDX audio mode, which is alleged to activate a customized audio profile for enhanced efficiency, made no noticeable distinction to sound high quality. The hear-through mode barely had any impact on having the ability to hear ambient sound even with no music enjoying.

Although connectivity was steady throughout my time with the Lypertek PurePlay Z7, I did expertise some points. Often, the earpieces did not flip off when positioned within the charging case, and stored enjoying music even with the lid shut. I needed to reposition the earpieces and maintain the lid shut tightly for a couple of seconds to pressure the Z7 to energy down.

On a few events, the earphones powered on and linked to my smartphone though the case was shut and was in a backpack untouched. This drained energy with out my information and will have interfered with cellphone utilization. These are probably design and construct high quality points with my particular overview unit, however are price mentioning nonetheless.

Call high quality was very odd; though voice pickup was acceptable in quiet areas, I wasn't too happy with what I might hear, and callers complained that my voice sounded a bit gentle after I was open air. On the entire, this pair of earphones solely actually performs effectively when listening to music, and is not the perfect alternative to be used as an on a regular basis all-purpose true wi-fi headset.

The Lypertek Tevi was one among my favorite true wi-fi headsets of 2020, and I used to be trying ahead to reviewing the PurePlay Z7 for that very cause. When it involves sound high quality, the Z7 would not disappoint, placing its hybrid triple-driver setup and codec assist to good use. Indeed, sound efficiency comes near what you would possibly anticipate from dearer choices such because the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2, and I fairly loved my time with this headset. There's additionally wi-fi charging and wonderful battery life.

That stated, there's not a lot else the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 will get proper. The match is precarious, the controls are old style, the app barely labored for me, name high quality is underwhelming, and there is not any energetic noise cancellation regardless of the worth. You're undoubtedly getting sound that matches the worth, however the limitations of this headset maintain it again from being as helpful as equally priced choices such because the Jabra Elite 85t and Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro.","{'uri': 'pehalnews.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pehal News'}",[],https://www.pehalnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lypertek-PurePlay-Z7-True-Wireless-Earphones-Review.jpg,0.419607843137255,,False,0,0.419607843137255,378946380,3

The new Kompanio 1380 is MediaTek's shot at the high-end SoC market, making it something we definitely want to get our hands on and test for ourselves. MediaTek chips for Chromebooks are generally in the 500- or 800-series, which means that the new SoC should offer some seriously competitive performance against rival Qualcomm and maybe even Intel.

Generally, MediaTek chips are known more for their power efficiency than their performance, so MediaTek-powered Chromebooks tend to be underperformers even though their battery life is quite good.

Acer's Chromebook Spin 513, announced today at CES 2022, is arguably the company's most popular Chromebook, so Acer is putting a lot of faith in the new chip. The new Chromebook will also feature a larger display, which - when paired with the more powerful processor - does indicate that its battery life is going to take a hit.

Last year's Chromebook Spin 513 was powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c and had a claimed battery life of about 13 and a half hours. We found the Chromebook Spin 513 lasted 12 hours 26 minutes in our review, which isn't quite as long but still not bad.

The new Chromebook Spin 513 will get up to 10 hours of battery life, according to Acer, which is quite a hit. We'll definitely be interested to see if the performance trade-off is worth it in the end.

In addition to the Acer Chromebook Spin 513, Acer also announced the Acer Chromebook 315, which will feature a 15.6-inch, full HD (1080p) anti-glare display and a full sized tenkey keyboard.

There is also the Acer Chromebook 314, which has a smaller 14-inch full HD, multitouch display, though the keyboard is tenkey-less.

OnePlus India today sent out invites for a virtual launch event scheduled for January 14, where the company will formally launch the OnePlus 9RT in that country.

For those unaware, the OnePlus 9RT is the only ""T"" series smartphone that OnePlus announced in 2021, having decided against launching the OnePlus 9T last year. Interestingly, the 9RT is somewhat of a successor to the OnePlus 9R -- an affordable flagship from the company that first launched in India alongside its pricier 9 series siblings.

&mdash; OnePlus India (@OnePlus_IN) January 3, 2022

How does it compare?

Even though the OnePlus 9RT sits a notch below the OnePlus 9 and the OnePlus 9Pro in the hierarchy, it is still a flagship-class device in its own right. The phone gets the same chip as its pricier siblings -- the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, -- and offers up to 256GB storage and 12GB of RAM on the top variants.

As expected, the camera is one area where the signs of cost-cutting are apparent.

Lacking Hasselblad branding, the rear-facing triple-camera array on the OnePlus 9RT includes a 50MP primary camera, a 16MP ultra-wide camera, and a frivolous 2MP depth sensor -- all with no OIS (Optical Image Stabilization). The front-facing camera uses a 16MP sensor housed within a hole-punch cutout. Also, there is no mention of any IP rating on the device, even though past experience tells us that the phone would be reasonably adept at repelling water. Of course, do not take it with you in the pool.

One area where OnePlus hasn't cut corners on the OnePlus 9RT is the screen, which is a 6.62-inch AMOLED with FHD+ resolution, support for a 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR10+ compatibility. And yes, the charging speeds are flagship-grade, too, with the 4,500 mAh battery supporting 65-watt fast charging with the supplied charger-cable combo.

In China, the OnePlus 9RT launched with Android 11, and that is likely the case when it gets to India later this month. We do expect the OnePlus 9RT to get Android 12 in the next few months -- even though OnePlus' recent track record with updates has been less than stellar. In China, the OnePlus 9RT retails for 3299 yuan ($520) for the base variant, going up to 3799 yuan ($600) for the top variant.

The India launch also opens the possibility of the OnePlus 9RT getting an even broader release in select European markets, although OnePlus has yet to formally talk about such an eventuality.

In one of the photos, the Lenovo Legion Y700 gaming tablet displays in text the 3.18 GHz frequency of the CPU in a full bar, with the GPU at 305 Mhz, but at only half a bar.

So by the looks of it, the Lenovo Legion Y700 tablet processor could be the Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 processor that can often be found running at those frequencies of 675 MHz for the graphics processor (GPU) and at 3.18 GHz for the processor (CPU).

It appears this straightforward insight has now also dawned on Qualcomm, who blamed the failure of the platform on OEMs charging more than $1000 for new Always-Connected PCs.

""One of the points that we were not satisfied with the early devices was the inadequate pricing,"" said Miguel Nunes , the Senior Director, Product Management at Qualcomm, in an interview with Golem.de.

Nunes however said that pricing was up to OEMs, though we have heard that pricing for ARM chipsets such as the Snapdragon 8cx were around the same as Intel chips, but with poorer performance.

Even now the Microsoft Surface Pro X costs more than $1500, though we are starting to see more reasonable priced ARM devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Book Go, which retails for less than $500.

Ultimately it was not the cost of the devices which undermined the platform, but the value - as Apple demonstrated with the Apple M1 chipset - if the performance is equivalent or better, buyers do not care which chip powers their device, which ultimately lays the blame on both Qualcomm and Microsoft.

Hopefully the next generation of Qualcomm processors for laptops and improvements to Windows 11 on ARM will address both issues.","{'uri': 'mspoweruser.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSPoweruser'}",[],https://mspoweruser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hp-spectre-folio.jpg,-0.2549019607843137,,False,0,-0.2549019607843137,378940740,3

There are three but the main one that caught my eye is the new Acer Chromebook Spin 513. Like its predecessor, it's powered by an ARM chip. However, this isn't a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c inside. This will be the first MediaTek Kompanio 1380 Chromebook, bringing what may be the best ARM-based silicon yet to Chrome OS.

Before hitting the chipset, let's go over the basics of this refresh. Instead of a widescreen display like on the prior model, the 2022 Acer Chromebook Spin has a 13.5-inch touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect. Acer calls it a ""VertiView"" screen because you get more vertical screen space to work with.

And that screen gets a resolution boost from the old 1080p resolution. This year the display offers 2256 x 1504 resolution, the same as the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 that was my 2021 Chromebook of the year pick. My current daily driver, the old Acer Chromebook Spin 13 has the same aspect ratio, screen size, and resolution, which suits me well.

This 2-in-1 has a backlit keyboard and what appears to be a reasonably large trackpad. Wi-Fi 6 support is inside, which is a nice upgrade if you have a compatible router. I'm sure Bluetooth is there too, but it's not mentioned on the official specifications page, as shown below:

The memory and internal storage capacities don't quite wow me, but again, this is an ARM-based Chromebook. With ""up to 8 GB"" of memory, I anticipate a base configuration with half that. There's no speedy NVMe SSD local storage either: It's eMMC all the way with either 32, 64, or 128 GB of capacity. There looks to be a USB Type-A port and USB Type-C on the left with another Type-C on the right, along with a microSD card slot. The overall chassis appears slightly redesigned to keep this laptop thin and light, weighing under three pounds.

Expect a starting price of $599.99 when the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 hits the U.S.A. in June. It will arrive overseas in April for 649 Euros.

Now, about that MediaTek Kompanio 1380. MediaTek hasn't provided any specs (yet) but we know from prior information, the old MT 8192 and MT 8195 chips are part of the Kompanio 800 and 1000 series. We also know that a powerful MediaTek Kompanio 1300T was announced in July although the company said at that time it was for Android tablets. Hence the ""T"", I suppose.

Still how much difference can there be between the 1380 and 1300T series?

Here's what MediaTek said about the 1300T:

The Kompanio 1300T chip is built on TSMC's 6nm process technology and integrates an octa-core CPU with high performance Arm Cortex-A78 cores and power-efficient Arm Cortex-A55 cores. In addition, its high performance nine-core Arm Mali-G77 MC9 GPU provides premium computing performance and supports high frame rates for longer, smoother gaming

Cortex A-78 is the newest and most power-efficient ARM architecture for high-performance cores. So too is Coretex A55 when it comes to churning through less complex tasks.

That's important considering even the second-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c uses the Cortex A-76 architecture built on an 8-nanometer process. The newer A-78 inside the 1300T uses a 6-nanometer process. So the transistors are more densely packed, which helps reduce power while also boosting performance.

Without full specifications of the Kompanio 1300 available, we can only make educated guesses on the silicon. It's at least part of the same family of chips as the 1300T.

Still, we do know from Acer's press release that this MediaTek Kompanio 1300 Chromebook has an octa-core chipset, just like the 1300T. Perhaps these aren't the newest Cortex A-78 cores, but surely, they're at least Cortex A-77. Dropping to the A-76 would be a two to three-year regression and not worth upgrading the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 from last year's model.

Oh and that Mali-G57 MC5 GPU is the same one used in MediaTek's Dimensity 1000C processor. Based on that, I see it's a five-core GPU chip capable of powering ""ultra-fast 120Hz single displays up to FHD+ resolution"". I don't think this new Spin 513 will have a 120Hz display, but that does suggest some decent graphical prowess.

Specifics aside, I expect the new Acer Chromebook Spin 513 brings a noticeable performance jump over last year's model with the Snapdragon 7c. If so, this may be the most powerful ARM-based Chromebook to date, closing the gap between those and the many Intel-powered Chrome OS laptops on the market. More competition between the platforms would be welcome with true desktop-class ARM-powered Chromebooks.","{'uri': 'aboutchromebooks.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'About Chromebooks'}",[],https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Acer-Chromebook-Spin-513-CP513-2H-open-and-tablet-e1641241417325.jpg,0.1764705882352942,eng-7380736,False,0.7490196228027344,0.1764705882352942,378938520,2

Then join our Team! English native speakers welcome!

The Acer Aspire 1 is a simple 14-inch office notebook, which sells for under 300 Euros. The laptop is not made of premium materials: Its housing is made of white plastic. Windows 10 Home S serves as the operating system. The OS can be upgraded to the regular version of Windows 10 Home for free.

The laptop features the Snapdragon 7c, 4 GB of RAM (soldered-on, no RAM slots) and a 64 GB eMMM module, which is why it can only handle office and web-based applications. The amount of storage space is very small: Straight out of the box, only 34 GB is available. After the installation of the latest feature update, only 24 GB is available.

The system can be easily overwhelmed: Opening multiple tabs or running multiple apps in the background can make the system feel very slow. Positive: The laptop is passively cooled and is, therefore, silent. Moreover, thanks to a Qualcomm SoC, the Aspire 1 lasted 17 hours in our Wi-Fi test.

You should be careful when buying an ARM notebook because there are many compatibility issues with such devices. Currently, Windows on ARM only supports 32-bit x86 applications (via emulation) and applications which were specifically compiled for ARM. This means that before committing to purchase, you should check the relevant apps for compatibility.

Acer's Chromebook Spin 713 can feel a bit utilitarian, from its forgettable name to its somewhat bland design, but this laptop isn't looking to turn heads. Instead, it's focused on providing its users a refined, relatively premium experience, with luxuries like its large trackpad and more-than-capable silicon. That makes it a little more expensive than some of its peers, but with the Spin 713 there's little doubt where your money is going. If you're looking for a Chromebook that can actually compete with, and in some ways surpass, Windows laptops with similar specs, this should be your go-to option.

Unlike the Lenovo, this 2-in-1 comes armed with all the accessories you'll need to take full advantage of it, including a stylus. The HP Chromebook X2 11 is a little smaller than some of these other options, but that can make it a great choice for users who value portability. It should handle all your Chrome OS demands just fine, but maybe don't go in with huge expectations when it comes to Linux or Android apps.

The Lenovo Duet 5 is great Chromebook for users who like a little flexibility, with its versatile 2-in-1 design. Unfortunately, the design isn't ideal for tablet mode, but it still works great as a laptop, and that OLED screen really manages to shine. The price is also easy to swallow, but you miss out on extras like a stylus as a result. It's a considerable upgrade over the cheaper (and criminally underpowered) Lenovo Chromebook Duet, but Chrome OS still has a long way to go to be great on tablets. Still, in docked mode this is our favorite Chromebook 2-in-1.

Picking the right Chromebook is difficult, and that's why this list is so short -- because while cheap Chromebooks are fine and in many situations appropriate for settings like schools, the laptops we're recommending are suitable as Windows or macOS replacements, ready to get stuff done. We will continue to add to this list, of course, but rest assured that we're not going to recommend anything that we wouldn't use ourselves.

While Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon chip often gets all of the glory, Samsung produces its own Exynos line of processors that are often used in regions outside of the US. The next Exynos chip is an exciting one as it's set to debut a new GPU made in collaboration with AMD, and now Samsung has set a reveal date for that chip which is likely destined for the Galaxy S22.

In a tweet just before the new year, Samsung officially announced that it would reveal its next Exynos chip on January 11. The new chip's name wasn't disclosed in the tweet, but Samsung did confirm this release would see the long-awaited debut of the company's partnership with AMD for a RDNA 2 GPU.

At this point, it's still not known for certain how Samsung's chip will benefit from the AMD GPU, beyond simple marketing purposes. Early leaks of Samsung's next Exynos chip with this new GPU, presumably on an early Galaxy S22 device, showed pretty promising numbers that even Apple would be jealous of, but benchmarks can only tell us so much.

The January 11 reveal for this Exynos chip makes sense, too, based on the timing of Samsung's usual chip launches. Generally speaking, these reveals come a few weeks, give or take, before a device uses the new hardware. In this case, that device will likely be the Galaxy S22 series, but it remains to be seen what regions will use this new Samsung Exynos chip and which will use a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 instead. The Galaxy S22 is expected to arrive in February.

Google, Microsoft, GM, P&G, TikTok, and more have already nixed plans to attend in person. CES is one of the biggest tech conferences of the year and typically draws over 170,000 attendees.

Major companies are pulling out of in-person events at the tech world's biggest conference of the year.

The Consumer Electronics Show is set to kick off on Wednesday, with tech companies, executives, and journalists converging on Las Vegas, Nevada, after a virtual-only event in 2021. But as the conference draws nearer, some of its biggest attendees are reconsidering plans to attend as the Omicron variant rips through the US.

Connected-fitness company Peloton said on Monday that it no longer plans to attend the invite-only Leaders in Technology dinner at CES. Unlike in previous years, the company is not exhibiting its products on the show floor -- the dinner would have been Peloton's only event at the conference.

""While the organizers have taken every possible health and safety precaution, we have made the difficult decision not to attend this year's Leaders In Technology dinner in person given the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" a Peloton spokesperson told Insider. ""We thank the CTA for all of their hard work and look forward to attending future conferences.""

Procter & Gamble has also opted out of in-person attendance as the Omicron variant spreads nationwide, instead shifting to a virtual press conference. And an AMD spokesperson told Reuters that it was also shifting its in-person engagements online ""in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, partners, and communities.""

Amazon, Google, GM, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft, Pinterest, TikTok, Twitter, and Meta, Facebook's parent company, have already nixed plans to travel to Las Vegas as well, and T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert has canceled his keynote speech at the conference, Bloomberg reports.

Some major firms, including Samsung, LG, BMW, Qualcomm, and Sony, are still planning to attend the show, according to TechCrunch.

On Friday, the Consumer Technology Association, which organizes CES, announced that the conference will close one day earlier than planned in response to rising COVID cases. But the CTA has doubled down on holding the event in person: Gary Shapiro, the group's president and CEO, wrote in the Las Vegas Review Journal earlier this month that the show ""will and must go on.""

""If we cancel the show, we will hurt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators who have made investments in building their exhibits and are counting on CES for their business, inspiration and future,"" Shapiro wrote. He went on to say that he anticipates that not canceling will result in a ""drumbeat of press and other critics who tell the story only through their lens of drama and big name companies.""

CES typically draws over 170,000 attendees and spreads out over nearly 3 million square feet at the Las Vegas Convention Center, as well as hotels throughout the Las Vegas Strip. In 2020, the last time the event was held in person, 4,419 companies exhibited.

The event waned in popularity as some major companies opted to hold their own keynote events versus making product announcements at the conference, but with the rise of the smart home in recent years, tech giants like Google and Amazon have upped their presence at the show -- even Apple attended the event 2020 for the first time since 1992.

But with positive daily COVID cases currently averaging well over 1 million worldwide, it's unlikely CES 2022 will be as well intended as organizers hoped.

Announces Strategic Investment In Metaverse-Ready XR Casino","SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, Jan. 03, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- BOTS, Inc.

SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, Jan. 03, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- BOTS, Inc. (OTC: BTZI), (""BOTS"" or ""The Company""), a global technology conglomerate specialized in Blockchain-based solutions including decentralized finance applications, cybersecurity, crypto generation, mining equipment repair, extended warranty contracts, and its upcoming proprietary Metaverse based on the terrestrial Las Vegas, VEGAS.MV, announced today strategic investment in XR Casino, Inc.

XR Casino is the first technology company specialized in Extended Reality (XR) cross-technology casino gaming, XR game development solutions, and NFTs for the iGaming and sports betting industries. Its patent-pending platform is currently in development and plans to leverage AI, Blockchain, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and Virtual Reality technologies to provide unparalleled gaming experiences and value-added services.

XR Casino completed the MVP versions of its initial games, Blackjack, Roulette, and Slot Machine in AR, MR, and VR, during 2021 and is on track to launch its social casino games and NFT store in Q2, 2022.

BTZI is the first strategic corporate investor in XR Casino and will be leveraging its technology to launch AR, MR, and VR casinos and casino games-as-a-service (GaaS) on its upcoming Metaverse based on the terrestrial Las Vegas.

""XR Casino's proprietary technology and games deliver the immersive casino gaming experiences of the Metaverse to anyone with an AR-enabled smartphone, AR/MR glasses or VR headset,"" commented Simon Rubin, chief executive officer of BOTS, Inc. ""We believe AR will lead the way in connecting people to the Metaverse and through our strategic investment in XR Casino we will be able to bring together players using AR, MR, and VR in our upcoming Vegas.mv Metaverse, regardless of the technology or equipment they are using.""

""We are excited to have BOTS, Inc. as our first strategic corporate investor and look forward to launching our games on their Las Vegas-themed Metaverse,"" commented Dan Martinez, Founder and CEO of XR Casino, Inc.

Virtual reality (VR) technology comes as a new phenomenon. It's leading the way that most people will play games in the future. A report issued in April 2021 from Brandessence Market Research claimed the global VR gaming market would be worth almost $52.7 billion by 2025.

Recent research by Mordor Intelligence titled: EXTENDED REALITY (XR) MARKET - GROWTH, TRENDS, COVID-19 IMPACT, AND FORECASTS (2021 - 2026) indicated that The Extended Reality (XR) Market is registering a healthy CAGR of over 62.67% during the forecast period (2021 - 2026). The extended reality (XR) market is being impacted by COVID-19, primarily due to multiple factors that include physical lockdowns, essential e-commerce delivery limitations, brick-and-mortar retail closures, and supply chain disruptions (supplier, manufacturer, distribution, wholesale, retail), and economic impacts. Further, a player such as Avnet Inc. has implemented operating cost-saving restructuring plans, including plans to reduce operating costs by USD 75 million annually by the second quarter of FY 2021. Avnet expects to use cash for restructuring, integration, and other expenses. Such initiatives are made to tackle the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.

Extended reality (XR) is currently an emerging umbrella term that encompasses immersive technologies, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, and other future realities such technologies might bring. The increasing demand for reducing the distance between people and richer visual content is driving market demand. According to a recent survey by Accenture, 80% of the business executives believed that it is essential to leverage XR solutions to bridge physical distance during employee engagement.

Companies are also developing supporting technologies for XR platforms, which are forecast to global commercialize XR technologies. In January 2019, Northern Digital Inc., a global manufacturer of 3D measurement and motion tracking solutions, launched its new electromagnetic sensor-fusion tracking technology for the XR platform: Atraxa.

Identifying a great potential in the XR domain, several companies have established their XR product lines globally. For instance, Qualcomm has developed First Responder XR Glass that uses inertial, haptic, environmental, and health sensors, eye-tracking cameras, bone conduction transducers, and other components aimed for more intelligent and faster interaction with the environment.

Microsoft developed HoloLens 2, a hands-free mixed reality headset that is a guiding force for XR's existence. It enables 3D visual training, hands-free video calling, and generates a virtual floor or room plan map.

Some major firms, including Samsung, LG, BMW, Qualcomm, and Sony, are still planning to attend the show, according to TechCrunch.

On Friday, the Consumer Technology Association, which organizes CES, announced that the conference will close one day earlier than planned in response to rising COVID cases. But the CTA has doubled down on holding the event in person: Gary Shapiro, the group's president and CEO, wrote in the Las Vegas Review Journal earlier this month that the show ""will and must go on.""

""If we cancel the show, we will hurt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators who have made investments in building their exhibits and are counting on CES for their business, inspiration and future,"" Shapiro wrote. He went on to say that he anticipates that not canceling will result in a ""drumbeat of press and other critics who tell the story only through their lens of drama and big name companies.""

CES typically draws over 170,000 attendees and spreads out over nearly 3 million square feet at the Las Vegas Convention Center, as well as hotels throughout the Las Vegas Strip. In 2020, the last time the event was held in person, 4,419 companies exhibited.

The event waned in popularity as some major companies opted to hold their own keynote events versus making product announcements at the conference, but with the rise of the smart home in recent years, tech giants like Google and Amazon have upped their presence at the show -- even Apple attended the event 2020 for the first time since 1992.

But with positive daily COVID cases currently averaging well over 1 million worldwide, it's unlikely CES 2022 will be as well intended as organizers hoped.","{'uri': 'markets.businessinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Markets Insider'}",[],https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/61d31ed687e64b0018e11f1c?format=jpeg,0.1058823529411765,eng-7377356,False,0.6196078658103943,0.1058823529411765,378931440,1

Announces Strategic Investment In Metaverse-Ready XR Casino","SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, Jan. 03, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- BOTS, Inc. (OTC: BTZI), (""BOTS"" or ""The Company""), a global technology conglomerate specialized in Blockchain-based solutions including decentralized finance applications, cybersecurity, crypto generation, mining equipment repair, extended warranty contracts, and its upcoming proprietary Metaverse based on the terrestrial Las Vegas, VEGAS.MV, announced today strategic investment in XR Casino, Inc.

XR Casino is the first technology company specialized in Extended Reality (XR) cross-technology casino gaming, XR game development solutions, and NFTs for the iGaming and sports betting industries. Its patent-pending platform is currently in development and plans to leverage AI, Blockchain, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and Virtual Reality technologies to provide unparalleled gaming experiences and value-added services.

XR Casino completed the MVP versions of its initial games, Blackjack, Roulette, and Slot Machine in AR, MR, and VR, during 2021 and is on track to launch its social casino games and NFT store in Q2, 2022.

BTZI is the first strategic corporate investor in XR Casino and will be leveraging its technology to launch AR, MR, and VR casinos and casino games-as-a-service (GaaS) on its upcoming Metaverse based on the terrestrial Las Vegas.

""XR Casino's proprietary technology and games deliver the immersive casino gaming experiences of the Metaverse to anyone with an AR-enabled smartphone, AR/MR glasses or VR headset,"" commented Simon Rubin, chief executive officer of BOTS, Inc. ""We believe AR will lead the way in connecting people to the Metaverse and through our strategic investment in XR Casino we will be able to bring together players using AR, MR, and VR in our upcoming Vegas.mv Metaverse, regardless of the technology or equipment they are using.""

""We are excited to have BOTS, Inc. as our first strategic corporate investor and look forward to launching our games on their Las Vegas-themed Metaverse,"" commented Dan Martinez, Founder and CEO of XR Casino, Inc.

Virtual reality (VR) technology comes as a new phenomenon. It's leading the way that most people will play games in the future. A report issued in April 2021 from Brandessence Market Research claimed the global VR gaming market would be worth almost $52.7 billion by 2025.

Recent research by Mordor Intelligence titled: EXTENDED REALITY (XR) MARKET - GROWTH, TRENDS, COVID-19 IMPACT, AND FORECASTS (2021 - 2026) indicated that The Extended Reality (XR) Market is registering a healthy CAGR of over 62.67% during the forecast period (2021 - 2026). The extended reality (XR) market is being impacted by COVID-19, primarily due to multiple factors that include physical lockdowns, essential e-commerce delivery limitations, brick-and-mortar retail closures, and supply chain disruptions (supplier, manufacturer, distribution, wholesale, retail), and economic impacts. Further, a player such as Avnet Inc. has implemented operating cost-saving restructuring plans, including plans to reduce operating costs by USD 75 million annually by the second quarter of FY 2021. Avnet expects to use cash for restructuring, integration, and other expenses. Such initiatives are made to tackle the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.

Extended reality (XR) is currently an emerging umbrella term that encompasses immersive technologies, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, and other future realities such technologies might bring. The increasing demand for reducing the distance between people and richer visual content is driving market demand. According to a recent survey by Accenture, 80% of the business executives believed that it is essential to leverage XR solutions to bridge physical distance during employee engagement.

Companies are also developing supporting technologies for XR platforms, which are forecast to global commercialize XR technologies. In January 2019, Northern Digital Inc., a global manufacturer of 3D measurement and motion tracking solutions, launched its new electromagnetic sensor-fusion tracking technology for the XR platform: Atraxa.

Identifying a great potential in the XR domain, several companies have established their XR product lines globally. For instance, Qualcomm has developed First Responder XR Glass that uses inertial, haptic, environmental, and health sensors, eye-tracking cameras, bone conduction transducers, and other components aimed for more intelligent and faster interaction with the environment.

Microsoft developed HoloLens 2, a hands-free mixed reality headset that is a guiding force for XR's existence. It enables 3D visual training, hands-free video calling, and generates a virtual floor or room plan map.

Major companies are pulling out of in-person events at the tech world's biggest conference of the year.

The Consumer Electronics Show is set to kick off on Wednesday, with tech companies, executives, and journalists converging on Las Vegas, Nevada, after a virtual-only event in 2021. But as the conference draws nearer, some of its biggest attendees are reconsidering plans to attend as the Omicron variant rips through the US.

Connected-fitness company Peloton said on Monday that it no longer plans to attend the invite-only Leaders in Technology dinner at CES. Unlike in previous years, the company is not exhibiting its products on the show floor -- the dinner would have been Peloton's only event at the conference.

""While the organizers have taken every possible health and safety precaution, we have made the difficult decision not to attend this year's Leaders In Technology dinner in person given the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" a Peloton spokesperson told Insider. ""We thank the CTA for all of their hard work and look forward to attending future conferences.""

Procter & Gamble has also opted out of in-person attendance as the Omicron variant spreads nationwide, instead shifting to a virtual press conference. And an AMD spokesperson told Reuters that it was also shifting its in-person engagements online ""in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, partners, and communities.""

According to Phonearena, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, the MediaTek Dimensity 9000, and the Samsung Exynos 2200 have overheating problems.

A chip that overheats can be an actual disaster. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 in 2015 had overheating problems and made Samsung use Exynos 7420 in some Galaxy S6 models. Despite many advances in the semiconductor industry, it seems that overheating still remains as a threat to new chips.

MediaTek uses TSMC's 4nm process node, and Snapdragon and Exynos chips will use the Samsung Foundry's 4nm process node. Also, Samsung will introduce Exynos 2200 on January 11.

last month, the famous tech tipster Ice Universe shared a tweet that intensified speculations about overheating problems of new chips. He wrote, ""On moto phones, the extreme test of the Snapdragon 8 Gen1 is very hot. Please be mentally prepared, 2022 may be ""HOOOT"" year for Android phones.""

According to Golden Reviewer, the Cortex-A510 core of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is 15% more powerful than the Cortex-A55, but it's 33% less efficient, and its power consumption is 70% higher. Also, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1's X2 core performance improved by 15%, but its efficiency has decreased. The performance of the A-710 core and Cortex-A78 is equal.

However, the GPU has gone through significant improvements. The performance improved by 50%, and the efficiency is 44% better. Golden Reviewer says that the GPU of Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 has the equal performance to Apple's A15 Bionic. Moreover, the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 is expected to have a privilege over the Snapdragon chip in terms of efficiency.

TSMC is currently working with Apple to produce its latest A-series chips. Also, the company will manufacture the MediaTek Dimensity 9000. In the year's third quarter, TSMC could conquer 53% of the market share, a significant leap compared to Samsung with 17%.

The overheating is not good news for smartphone manufacturers and buyers. It remains to be seen how the major players in the semiconductor industry will solve this problem in their new chips. If this problem occurs with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will likely be outsourced to TSMC.","{'uri': 'androidheadlines.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Headlines'}",[],https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-765-5G-Chip-In-Hand-01.jpg,-0.0980392156862745,eng-7383684,False,0.8352941274642944,-0.0980392156862745,378930240,2

First, there were the new requirements for Secure Boot and TPM 2.0, next was diminished performance when gaming, and now several users are facing issues with their network adapters, specifically the Killer Wireless line from Intel.

If you too have been facing driver issues or are unable to get your Killer Wireless card working at all, then here's all you need to know about it.

Developed by Rivet Technologies and later bought by Intel, Killer Wireless 1535 is a WLAN or network card developed for gaming-oriented systems. The Killer Wireless list of cards boasts a long list of features including Bluetooth 4.1 along with dual-band support for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz.

Based on a Qualcomm chip, the Killer Wireless sports ExtremeRange technology for achieving a wide range of connections, minimal packet loss, and minimized latency when playing multiplayer games.

The problems with Killer Wireless are not new. For the last few years, it has been causing issues for multiple users on Windows 10, and the switch to Windows 11 seems to have made things worse. According to the Killer Wireless website, their drivers didn't support Windows 11 when it was launched, which caused driver issues for many users who switched to Windows 11.

The series also faced limited support once it was bought out by Intel and initial support pages detailing fixes were removed from the site altogether.

Microsoft also mentioned that it could be caused because of a network bug on Windows 11 that affected UDP. Outdated drivers and the absence of compatibility patches between the Killer Wireless software and Windows 11 could have resulted in major driver issues.

Here is a list of fixes that are known to fix Killer Wireless 1535 driver issues on most systems. We recommend you start with the first few known fixes and make your way through the list until you manage to get Wi-Fi working on your device again. Let's get started.

If you can access the Killer Wireless Control Center then this is the recommended fix for you. Wi-Fi prioritization is a feature in the Killer Wireless Control Center that uses Intel's prioritization engine to identify ongoing network requests and prioritize them according to your current needs and requirements. This helps your network adapter automatically serve your multiplayer gaming connection needs first and address background network tasks later.

However, this Prioritization Engine does more harm than good. With outdated drivers and limited support, most Killer network cards seem to face issues with this feature on Windows 11. Hence we recommend disabling the same and restarting your system at the earliest. If you have a gaming laptop bought a few years ago, then this is likely the cause of your wireless driver issues.

Launch the Killer Wireless Control Center and simply turn off the toggle for 'Prioritization Engine' in the Quick Settings widget. You can also turn off the same by clicking on Prioritization Engine at the top. Once turned off, restart your system, and Wi-Fi should be back up and running on your system again.

This is the next recommended fix, especially if you are facing driver issues with your Killer Wireless Network Adapter with the driver failing in your device manager. Microsoft usually looks out for its users and has features built-in that can help you revert changes that might break features on your system.

This is one of the reasons why you can not only rollback driver updates but also select a different driver when it comes to components like your network adapter and Bluetooth adapter. Use the guide below to manually select a different driver for your Killer Wireless Network adapter. Let's get started.

Find your Killer Wireless Network Adapter under 'Network Adapters' and click and select it. Hit on your keyboard to open the Properties window.

Switch to the 'Driver' tab by clicking on the same at the top.

Now click on 'Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer'.

Click and select a new driver from the list. We highly recommend you give the Qualcomm drivers a shot as they seem to fix Wi-Fi issues on most systems. However, you can try all of them until you find the one that works the best for you.

You will now be prompted to restart your system, click on 'Yes' to restart your PC.

Once your PC restarts, try connecting to a network again. In most cases, your Killer Wireless Network Adapter should now be back up and running again as intended on your system.

At this point, we recommend you try updating Windows 11 to the latest Cumilitavie updates that bring official fixes from Microsoft to fix Killer Wireless driver issues on most systems. Use the guide below depending on your current setup.

When Microsoft encountered reports of multiple users facing issues with Killer Wireless on Windows 11, they started distributing a fix through cumulative updates. Microsoft mentioned that it could be caused because of a bug that affects the UDP packets and results in internet throttling.

We recommend you check and download any updates available for your PC and make sure that you are running Windows 11 Cumulative update vKB5006674 or later.

If you are a Windows Insider, then we recommend you update your Windows 11 to Developer version vKB5008918 + USP-721.1116.211.0 or higher. This is the latest fix issued by Microsoft that seems to fix the known network bug affecting UDP connections.

Simply head to Settings > Windows Update > Check for updates to update your Windows 11 to its latest available version.

Note: If you haven't updated your system in a while then you might need to install certain incremental updates before and then subsequently update again to get the latest version of Windows 11 running on your system.

The most obvious solution to fix a Driver issue is to simply update the drivers, so follow the steps below and see if it fixes the problem for you.

Type the command below in the run box and then hit the enter key or press OK.

Click and switch to the 'Driver' tab at the top and then click on 'Update Driver'.

The latest update for Windows 11 Killer Wireless Network adapter should now have fixed your Wi-Fi issues after a restart.

Windows update provides automatic updates for your drivers, but it won't always provide you with the updates that you need. Users often make use of third-party software to get automatic updates for the drivers on their PC/Laptop. Follow the guide below to get you started.

Visit the link above and click on 'Download Latest Version'.

A .zip file will now be downloaded to your local storage. Download it to a convenient location and extract the archive using your preferred utility. Once extracted, double click and launch the x64 .exe file.

Accept the license agreement by clicking on the same.

Note: Allow the program to access your network in case you are prompted. This will be used to download the latest drivers currently available for your system.

Now click on 'Updates are available: SDI NNNNN and NN driverpacks' at the top.

You will now be shown a list of all the currently known driver updates available for your system. Click on 'Check only needed for this PC'.

The tool will now automatically detect your components and select the appropriate driver updates for your system. Once selected, look for any Network Adapter-related updates checked in the list. In case any are found, uncheck all the rest of the selections and click on 'Ok' at the bottom.

SDI will now automatically download and install the selected drivers on your PC. Once done, close the program, and restart your PC.

If incompatible drivers or missing drivers were the cause of your issue then this should help fix your Killer Wireless Network card. You can now connect to a network and continue using the internet as usual on your system.

Make a right-click on the taskbar to open a context menu.

Launch Task Manager by clicking Task Manager from the list.

Look for Killer Wireless and make a right-click on it.

Follow the same process to disable any other Killer Wireless driver or software.

If by this point you are still facing Network card issues then it could be a hardware-related issue on your system. We recommend you use the following two options in case you are desperate to connect to a network on your system. Let's get started.

We are sorry if none of the above-mentioned steps worked for you, but rest assured we still have a last resort to help you get back on the internet. Though it may not seem very convenient, you can get the same speed out of your router if you are ready to go old school.

Yes, we are talking about Ethernet cables. You can easily connect your computer with your router via an Ethernet cable and get good internet speed without any hassle. Being a simple wired connection, it won't have any dependency on the Killer Wireless Drivers and will provide you with the best possible speed without any throttling.

Windows tends to hold and keep basic .inf files for components hidden in the background even if you uninstall them from the device manager. These driver files are used to provide basic functionality when you have no driver files installed or available for your system.

However, if you haven't cleared your Driver Store in a while then you could have multiple Killer Wireless network adapter drivers on your system which could be conflicting in the background. As a last resort, we will now force remove them from your system, reset the CMOS battery and then install the latest Killer Wireless Network Adapter drivers currently available for your system. Follow the guide below to get you started.

You will need to make sure that your PC meets the following criteria before proceeding with the guide below as you will use the ability to connect to a wireless network once we force remove all drivers from your system.

Visit the link above and download the latest archive for DriverStoreExplorer linked on the page.

Once downloaded, extract the archive and launch 'Rapr.exe' as an administrator.

The tool will take a few moments to scan your driver store and then show all the drivers installed on your current Windows setup. Click on 'Driver Class' column at the top to sort your drivers by their class.

Now look for 'Network adapters' in this list and check the box for each driver that you find.

Warning: Ensure that you are only selecting drivers that you wish to remove. DriverStoreExplorer is quite a thorough tool that manages to bypass most failsafes when removing drivers, hence if you end up removing the wrong drivers then you can face serious hardware failure issues with your system.

Click on 'Ok' to confirm your choice. The selected drivers will now be deleted from your PC. Once done, close the app and turn off your system at the earliest.

We now recommend you reset your CMOS battery. This is a recommended step that requires you to open up your PC or laptop to reset the CMOS battery. As this is an advanced step and you are hesitant to open up your PC then you can skip it and continue with reinstalling your drivers using the guide below.

A CMOS reset helps reset your system components as well as drain capacitors that could be malfunctioning on your board. A CMOS reset will help your network adapter get a fresh start which when combined with a fresh driver update should help get everything working again. Use this comprehensive guide by us to reset your CMOS battery.

Now it's a matter of simply installing your latest Killer Wi-Fi drivers. If you have an installer package then simply double click the file and follow the on-screen instructions from your OEM to install the latest drivers on your system. However, if you have .inf files then you can use the guide below to manually install your drivers.

Click on 'Browse' and select the folder on your local storage containing your .inf files.

The .inf files will now be installed on your system. Once done, click on 'Close'.

We now recommend you restart your system for the changes to take effect. Once restarted, try connecting to a wireless network. If everything is working as intended then we recommend you skip the optional section below. However, certain network adapters need you to select a different driver depending on your manufacturer. Use the guide below to help you with this process.

If you wish to manually select a different driver then we recommend you use the guide at the top of this post. Multiple drivers for the same network adapter can exist depending on its components, specifications, and skew. Selecting a different one will help you fix driver conflicts and help you get everything back up and running on your system.

With so much to do and fix, you are bound to have a few questions. Here are some commonly asked ones, to help get you up to speed with the latest developments.

Yes, you should be able to fix it by switching back to Windows 10. But you should try the solutions mentioned above and see if it fixes the problem. If your problems are fixed, then you won't need to go through the pain of downgrading back to Windows 10 and would be able to enjoy the fresh feel and latest features of Windows 11.

Yes, it is safe to change the network card to fix Killer Wireless issues. But make note that opening your PC or Laptop on your own can void its warranty and wrong handling of the components can give you a minor to major level shock and could also damage your PC/Laptop. It is always advised to get any such components replaced by trained professionals.

Available with up to 8GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage, the 2.84 pound Chromebook is also powered by a previously unannounced MediaTek Kompanio 1380 processor. The notebook will be available in the second quarter of 2022 with prices starting at $600.

Acer says the new Chromebook Spin 513 has 18 percent more vertical screen space than last year's model, which featured a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c processor and a 13.3 inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel display with a 16:9 aspect ratio.

While there aren't many details about the new processor, we do know that it's an octa-core chip that features ARM Mali-G57 graphics.

Other features include LPDDR4X memory, 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB eMMC storage options, support for up to 10 hours of battery life, and support for WiFi 6.

The Chromebook Spin measures 11.81'' x 9.25'' x 0.64'' and features a backlit keyboard, upward-facing stereo speakers, dual microphones, and a MIL-STD 810 tested case.

If there's a weak point, it may be that the computer has eMMC storage rather than the the fasted SSD that you'd typically expect in a Chromebook in this price range.

Acer says the Chromebook Spin 513 (CP513-2H) will be available in the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) in April for 649 Euros and up.

The Galaxy Tab S7 and S7+ were released in 2020 to high praise, with many users seeing the device as the perfect iPad Pro alternative. While the Galaxy Tab S7 FE wasn't quite as nice, the Tab S8 has been thoroughly leaked throughout much of 2021, hinting that a true successor might not be too far off. Here's everything you need to know about Samsung's next flagship tablet.

Three tablets, three sizes

Samsung released the Galaxy Tab S7 in two different sizes: a standard 11"" model, along with a 12.9"" ""Plus"" variant. The display was the most significant differentiator between the two -- and not just in size. While the smaller Tab S7 used an LCD panel, its big brother had a gorgeous 120Hz OLED panel, still one of the best you can find today.

For its successor, Samsung is tripling down. Much like its flagship phones series, the company is introducing the Tab S8 in three sizes: an 11"" S8, a 12.9"" S8+, and a laptop-worthy 14.6"" S8 Ultra. It's hard to imagine how large the audience is for a slate that big, but it seems like Samsung sees it as an untapped market full of potential.

Like last year, the Tab S8 will keep its 11"" 120Hz LCD panel, while the larger two models both earn upgrades to 120Hz AMOLED displays. It's slightly disappointing that Samsung continues to hold back its best screen tech for its larger models -- not everyone needs or wants a 15"" slate, after all. It's something we hope changes with the Tab S9 -- though we don't expect that model to arrive until sometime in 2023.

While the exact screen resolution has yet to leak for either the Tab S8 or S8+, we expect those models to match the resolutions of their respective predecessors. The Tab S8 Ultra gets a nice bump to match its larger display, coming in at 2960 x 1848. Regardless, pixel density should be around the same for all three models.

There's one more aspect that sets the Ultra's massive screen apart from the others: a notch-shaped cutout for its front-facing camera. It'll likely be a controversial switch for Samsung -- and indeed, it's already drawn comparisons to Apple's latest MacBook Pro -- but leaked renders seem to indicate a fairly minor indent that shouldn't make too much of an impact on daily use. There's no doubt some potential buyers will be turned off by it, but at least it's only on the largest of models.

Aside from the Ultra's notch, the design of all three devices is nearly identical to that of the Tab S7, down to the same flat back with matching antenna lines and an S Pen magnet. Outside of the notch, the only major difference between models is the size of the power button. The Tab S8+ and Ultra feature in-display fingerprint sensors, but the smallest S8 does not. Instead, it has an elongated power button for unlocking the tablet. It's a small change and shouldn't really take away from the entry-level model, should you be drawn to the 11"" display.

Performance and cameras

As you should expect from Samsung's top-tier tablets, all three should be plenty fast. Recent rumors point to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip powering the Tab S8 series, which -- depending on when these actually ship -- might make these slates one of the first ways to experience Qualcomm's latest processor.

The smaller two models haven't faced nearly as many leaks as the Ultra, but considering Samsung usually doesn't change up the specs all too much between its different-sized gadgets, we can largely assume the following will apply to all three slates. The Tab S8 Ultra will include 8, 12, or 16GB of RAM, each respectively paired with 128, 256, or 512GB of storage. The 16GB/512GB SKU seems destined to be an Ultra-exclusive, but expect the other two combinations to appear on the S8 and S8+. Samsung's biggest model will come in both Wi-Fi and 5G variants, in case you want to take that behemoth on the go.

Leaked spec sheets indicate massive batteries in all three models, ranging from 8,000mAh in the Tab S8 to 11,200mAh in the S8 Ultra. That's on par with the Tab S7 models, so battery life should be fairly comparable between generations. Although it's unclear how fast the Tab S8 and S8+ will charge, the Ultra will match its massive battery capacity with 45W charging.

Most people usually don't buy a tablet because of its cameras, but that doesn't mean Samsung is skimping out on its image capabilities. While we don't know the exact specs for the two smaller models, the Ultra will use a standard 12MP wide lens and a 6MP ultra-wide for its rear-facing cameras, along with dual 12MP cameras in its notch for video calls. Capable of shooting in 4K at 60FPS, it could make the Tab S8 Ultra a must-have for anyone routinely stuck in meetings all day.

Software

Don't expect Samsung to rock the boat with its software experience on the Tab S8 series. All three models should run Android 12 with One UI 4.1, marking some of the first slates to arrive on the market with this latest OS version and following up on a similar update for the Tab S7. Recent rumors point to some nice quality-of-life improvements on the way, including window transparency levels, customization settings -- likely matching what we've seen from Android 12 on the Galaxy S21 series -- and dimming modes for late-night usage. Portrait orientation support is coming to DeX Mode, which should make the desktop PC-esque workflow a whole lot more usable on the go.

Pricing and availability

Unfortunately, it remains unclear when Samsung intends to announce and release the Tab S8 series. When the lineup first surfaced last May, it seemed all but inevitable that a late 2021 launch was in the cards. Obviously, that date has come and gone, with the company revealing its mid-range Tab S7 FE instead. A Q1 2022 reveal is possible, but without any leaks or hints as to when Samsung might drop the series, your guess is as good as ours.

As for pricing, our only trifle of information comes from that initial leak. If the listed numbers remain accurate, prices start around $740 for the 11"" model, with the 12.4"" slate marked at $1,120. Unsurprisingly, the 14.6"" model has a price tag that matches its gigantic display, starting at $1,320 for its entry-level specs. Even if these numbers prove to be overinflated, it's clear you should start saving your pennies now for the company's eventual reveal.

Samsung proved itself the last real competition left for Apple with the Galaxy Tab S7, and with its successor, it's looking to refine what a flagship tablet can do in 2022. While the Tab S8 series isn't a dramatic reinvention compared to its last-gen model, a big, bold display might be enough to convince buyers to drop Windows laptops altogether in exchange for a near-15"" slate. We'll have to wait and see just how powerful -- and how expensive -- the Tab S8 really is.

With a new year comes new phones, and Samsung will be one of the first out of the gate with the Galaxy S22 series. The device should be released sometime in the next month or two, so there are naturally a lot of leaks to look at.

91mobiles has the official Samsung-made renders of the company's next flagship. The big news this year is that the highest-end SKU, the Galaxy S22 Ultra, is being converted into a Galaxy Note substitute and will ship with an internally stowable S-Pen. Samsung killed the S-Pen-equipped Galaxy Note last year, with reports saying the Note and S line were too similar and that culling the slab smartphone lineup would let Samsung focus more on foldables. With its squared-off design and S-Pen present in all the renders, the S22 Ultra is a Galaxy Note in everything but name.

Fans of the S-Pen will be happy, but Samsung is sacrificing some runtime for S-Pen storage. There's no getting around having to carve out a big chunk of internal space to store a stylus, and in 2020, the 5000 mAh S20 Ultra had 500 mAh more battery capacity than the 4500 mAh Note 20 Ultra. This year, the S22 Ultra is rumored to hit 5000 mAh even with the S-Pen hole, thanks to battery density improvements. Still, the battery could have been larger without S-Pen storage.

The ultra model has individual rear camera lenses instead of the big corner bump of last year. The front camera is still a hole-punch cutout, though it's hard to see in these renders. The phone is still supposedly built around a 6.8-inch, 120 Hz display.

91Mobiles has also published renders of the base model S22, which seems to be sticking with last year's design. That means the corner camera bump returns, along with more rounded corners. The new phone is actually smaller than last year's model, however, with a 6.09-inch display and a 3700 mAh battery, compared to the S21's 6.2-inch display and 4000 mAh battery.

In some regions like the US, Samsung will be one of the first companies to launch a device with the new flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC (Xiaomi is the first). The chip is a sequel to last year's Snapdragon 888 and is Qualcomm's first ARM v9 SoC. It is built on a 4nm process and follows ARM's recommended layout, with a single 3 GHz Cortex X2 core, three medium Cortex A710 CPUs at 2.5 GHz, and four small Cortex A510 CPUs.

These are all brand-new core designs, allowing high-end devices to finally retire the ancient A55 core, which has been doing small-core work for the last four years. ARM is also working toward a world of 64-bit-only CPUs. Only the medium A710 cores still support 32-bit this generation, and next year, ARM's flagship design will only support 64-bit code.

In other regions, Samsung will be shipping an Exynos SoC (the Exynos 2200) in the Galaxy S22. All of the above Qualcomm descriptions will most likely also apply to Samsung's Exynos chip, but this year, the Exynos division is making a major change and partnering with AMD for the GPU. Samsung has already started hyping this partnership up, calling out AMD's ""RDNA 2"" GPU architecture in a tweet:

Shipping an AMD Radeon GPU in a smartphone is obviously a huge win for the marketing department, but it remains to be seen how much of a performance difference AMD can bring to the table. Samsung also has an awkward road ahead since it seems that the biggest markets, like the US and China, are still getting Qualcomm chips and will be left out of the Radeon hype-fest.

As the tweet says, the big Exynos announcement will be January 11, and we'll see an S22 unveiling sometime after that.","{'uri': 'arstechnica.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Ars Technica'}","[{'uri': 'ron_amadeo@arstechnica.com', 'name': 'Ron Amadeo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-760x380.jpg,0.0117647058823529,eng-7377109,False,0.5490196347236633,0.0117647058823529,378929460,3

Consequently, I recommend that long-term investors buy shares of Upstart at current levels. Today, the stock trades around the $150 mark.

Here's what you should know about UPST stock moving forward.

Ever since my previous article on Upstart was published on Nov. 26, UPST stock has fallen about 28%. The forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio is now 77, according to Seeking Alpha. That's down from a P/E of 84. Given Upstart's status as a rapidly growing, likely disruptive tech company, this is not a very high P/E.

Meanwhile, there are signs that the macro environment is also improving. That's largely because the omicron variant of Covid-19 appears to be much milder than delta. Further, it seems like the government is starting to prioritize things like the economy over strict pandemic protocols now, too. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for instance, recently lowered the quarantine period for workers.

This decision suggests that the government is approaching Covid in a new way, even mirroring recommendations made by some scientists over a year ago. The strategy? To ""allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.""

In my view, this new approach can in turn help lower inflation, preventing the Federal Reserve from having to quickly raise interest rates. As a result, growth names like UPST stock will likely rebound in 2022.

In addition to the improving macro environment, a few factors have made me more upbeat on this company's longer-term outlook. First, the company -- which entered the auto-lending market in October -- should benefit from the easing of the chip shortage and other supply-chain issues in that sector. Recently, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon said the crisis is becoming less intense. That trend should continue in 2022.

Secondly, one Seeking Alpha article recently reported that Upstart should soon enter the mortgage market. According to Statista, the primary U.S. mortgage market was worth about $16.6 trillion in 2020. Obviously, if Upstart could generate even 0.25% or 0.5% of the revenue from that sector, both its financial results and UPST stock would soar tremendously.

Finally, though, Upstart has said it's also looking to enter the U.S. micro loan market for both consumers and small businesses. In the States, microcredit is an ""underserved"" area where banks often fear to tread. In fact, in a May 2021 blog, credit-rating bureau Experian wrote the following:

""Banks are typically reluctant to make very small loans, however, and last year the average SBA [small business administration] loan was $272,000. Microlending is a financing solution designed to bridge this gap by providing small loans to business owners who can't get financing from traditional sources.""

I believe that Upstart -- with its advanced AI-based technology -- will likely be much better at predicting defaults on micro loans than more widely used, older technologies. All told, it could generate a great deal of revenue and profit in that area.

No doubt, micro loans could be a great avenue for Upstart as the company expands. However as I noted above, that's not the only thing this company has going for it.

Given the recent sharp decline in UPST stock, along with the improving macro picture and the big potential of its new products, shares here are definitely a buy for growth investors. Consider buying this name while you can.

Its 3-year-old chip unit, T-Head, unveiled its third processor in October, the Yitian 710 for Alibaba's cloud computing business. Alibaba says for now, it has no plans to sell the chip to outsiders.

Other rookie chip developers including Tencent, a games and social media giant, and smartphone brand Xiaomi are pledging billions of dollars in line with official plans to create computing, clean energy and other technology that can build China's wealth and global influence.

Processor chips play an increasingly critical role in products from smartphones and cars to medical devices and home appliances. Shortages due to the coronavirus pandemic are disrupting global manufacturing and adding to worries about supplies.

Chips are a top priority in the ruling Communist Party's marathon campaign to end China's reliance on technology from the United States, Japan and other suppliers Beijing sees as potential economic and strategic rivals. If it succeeds, business and political leaders warn that might slow down innovation, disrupt global trade and make the world poorer.

""Self-reliance is the foundation for the Chinese nation,"" President Xi Jinping said in a speech released in March. He called for China to become a ""technology superpower"" to safeguard ""national economic security.""

""We must strive to become the world's main center of science and the high ground of innovation,"" Xi said.

Beijing might be chasing a costly disappointment. Even with huge official investments, businesspeople and analysts say chipmakers and other companies will struggle to compete if they detach from global suppliers of advanced components and technology -- a goal no other country is pursuing.

""It's hard to imagine any one country rebuilding all of that and having the best technology,"" said Peter Hanbury, who follows the industry for Bain & Co.

Beijing's campaign is adding to tension with Washington and Europe, which see China as a strategic competitor and complain it steals technology. They limit access to tools needed to improve its industries.

If the world were to decouple, or split into markets with incompatible standards and products, U.S.- or European-made parts might not work in Chinese computers or cars. Smartphone makers who have a single dominant global operating system and two network standards might need to make unique versions for different markets. That could slow down development.

Washington and Beijing need to ""avoid that the world becomes separated,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told The Associated Press in September.

China's factories assemble the world's smartphones and tablet computers but need components from the United States, Europe, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Chips are China's biggest import, ahead of crude oil, at more than $300 billion last year.

Official urgency over that grew after Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, lost access to U.S. chips and other technology in 2018 under sanctions imposed by the White House.

That crippled the telecom equipment maker's ambition to be a leader in next-generation smartphones. American officials say Huawei is a security risk and might aid Chinese spying, an accusation the company denies.

Huawei and some Chinese rivals are close to matching Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc., South Korea's Samsung Electronics and Britain's Arm Ltd. at being able to design ""bleeding edge"" logic chips for smartphones, according to industry analysts.

But when it comes to making them, foundries such as state-owned SMIC in Shanghai are up to a decade behind industry leaders including TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., which produces chips for Apple Inc. and other global brands.

Even companies such as Alibaba that can design chips likely will need Taiwanese or other foreign foundries to make them. Alibaba's Yitian 710 requires precision no Chinese foundry can achieve. The company declined to say which foreign producer it will use.

""My country still faces a big gap in chip technology,"" said industry analyst Liu Chuntian of Zero Power Intelligence Group.

China accounts for 23% of global chip production capacity but only 7.6% of sales.

Packing millions of transistors onto a fingernail-size sliver of silicon requires some 1,500 steps, microscopic precision and arcane technologies owned by a handful of U.S., European, Japanese and other suppliers.

They include KLA Corp. in California for super-precise measurement and Japan's TEL for machines to apply coatings a few molecules thick. Many are covered by restrictions on ""dual use"" technologies that can be used in weapons.

China ""lags significantly"" in tools, materials and production technology, the Semiconductor Industry Association said in a report this year.

Washington and Europe, citing security worries, block access to the most advanced tools Chinese chipmakers need to match global leaders in precision and efficiency.

Without those, China is falling farther behind, said Bain's Hanbury.

""The TSMC horse is sprinting away and the Chinese horse is stopped,"" he said. ""They can't move forward.""

Washington stepped up pressure on Huawei last year by barring global foundries from using American technology to produce its chips. U.S. vendors can sell chips to the company, but not for next-generation ""5G"" smartphones.

For its part, the European Union said it will review foreign investments after complaints China was eroding Europe's technology lead by purchasing important assets such as German robot maker Kuka.

Alibaba's Yitian 710 is based on architecture from Britain's Arm, highlighting China's enduring need for foreign know-how. Alibaba said it still will work closely with longtime foreign suppliers Intel, Arm, Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

T-Head's first chip, the Hanguang 800, was announced in 2019 for artificial intelligence. Its second, the XuanTie 910, is for self-driving cars and other functions.

In November, Tencent Holding, which operates the WeChat messaging service, announced its first three chips for artificial intelligence, cloud computing and video.

Beijing says it will spend $150 billion from 2014 through 2030 to develop its chip industry, but even that is a fraction of what global leaders invest. TSMC plans to spend $100 billion in the next three years on research and manufacturing.

China is trying to buy experience by hiring engineers from TSMC and other Taiwanese producers. Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory and has threatened to attack, has responded by imposing curbs on job advertising.

Beijing encourages smartphone and other manufacturers to use suppliers within China, even if they cost more, but officials deny China wants to detach from global industries.

""We will never go back in history by seeking to decouple,"" Xi said in a speech by video link to a November meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia.

The latest conflict is over photolithography, which uses ultraviolet light to etch circuits into silicon on a scale measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter.

The leader is ASML in the Netherlands, which makes machines that can etch transistors just 5 nanometers apart. That would pack 2 million into a space one centimeter wide.

China's SMIC is about one-third as precise at 14 nanometers. Taiwan's TSMC is preparing to increase its precision to 2 nanometers.

SMIC wants to upgrade by purchasing ASML's latest machine, but the Dutch government has yet to agree.

""We will wait for their decision,"" said an ASML spokeswoman, Monica Mols, in an email.","{'uri': 'manufacturing.net', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Manufacturing.net'}",[],https://img.manufacturing.net/files/base/indm/multi/image/2022/01/16x9/AP21362025220409.61d31678aa1e2.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,0.1607843137254903,,False,0,0.1607843137254903,378924540,1

AI development is typically a time-consuming process that takes more than a year, with the involvement of costly high-quality talent such as data scientists, engineers, domain experts, and managers. The model inference process alone can take another 12 to 24 months before deployment kicks in. After an AI model is completed, developers still need to spend time and hire engineers to deploy their AI models.

The so-called traditional way of developing AI also eats up a massive amount of time, as waiting for computing takes up to 80% of that time. Both these time and cost barriers keep small businesses from competing on a level playing field with larger businesses with deeper pockets.

hAIsten AI is a game changer: the low-code AI software leverages multi-GPUs to speed up AI development and shortens the AI development cycle from years to months.

Chinese smartphone manufacturer Realme is all set to introduce an out-and-out lineup of 5G devices in the year 2022. The report comes in as Realme CEO Madhav Sheth informed that the company is allocating about 90% of its resources for the development of 5G technology in its R&D department. As of now, Realme only offers 5G devices in the premium smartphone category and the majority of its devices are 4G enabled smartphones. However, the portfolio of the company will change with the smartphone manufacturer assigning 90% of its resources to the R&D department to develop 5G technology.

CEO Madhav Sheth said in a statement that the company is going to invest millions of dollars in developing beautiful aesthetics of the Realme devices and the process of improving the performance on 5G smartphones. He said that the company wants to avoid bulky 5G devices and to ensure that the company has set up seven R&D plants in total including one in India.

He further informed that the company aims to become one of the leading players in the 5G smartphone market in India. The rumours suggest that Realme might launch 5G handsets in India starting from the price tag of Rs 15000. The reason behind this pricing could be a substantial surge in the availability of budget 5G enabled chipsets in the market. Realme could launch its 5G smartphones with some of the popular budget chipsets available in the market such as Qualcomm's Snapdragon 480, 480 Plus and 690 5G as well as MediaTek Dimensity 700, 900, 920 and 810.

To validate this information, Realme is already gearing up to launch its Realme 9 Series which will consist of Realme 9 and Realme 9 Pro. The spotting of the devices at multiple certification sites reveals that the devices will be powered by MediaTek Dimensity 810 and MediaTek Dimensity 920 chipsets. The rumours suggest that the devices will be 5G enabled and the launch is expected to be in the month of February. Realme 9 Series is expected to launch first in European markets followed by other regions such as India or China.","{'uri': 'telecomtalk.info', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TelecomTalk'}","[{'uri': 'anupam_sharma@telecomtalk.info', 'name': 'Anupam Sharma', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://telecomtalk.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/realme-to-increase-its-5g-smartphones-portfolio-1024x683.jpeg,0.1529411764705881,eng-7378497,False,0.7215686440467834,0.1529411764705881,378923220,1

A week ago, Reddit user UnknownWon posted a video on YouTube unboxing the brand new mid-range smartphone in an olive green colour.

He accompanied his post with a photo showing the phone's box and an open window of CPU-Z with its chip's specifications, revealing his model was running a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, the same processor found in the Galaxy S21 series.

In response to questions on Reddit, he also revealed the price he paid for it.

If that turns out to be the official launch price, it would be significantly cheaper than its predecessor, which cost R17,995 at release.

MyBroadband contacted UnknownWon for further feedback on how he managed to buy the phone but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

According to his responses on Reddit, he bought it off a friend who works in retail.

He also posted a short review in which he shared more details on his experience with the phone, which can be seen below.

Based on his assessment of the phone, the camera system appears to be the same as the S20 FE's.

He also praised the soft-touch material on the back of the phone. He said it ensured a comfortable grip.

The S21 FE has only been teased by Samsung and is expected to make its official debut at CES 2022 later this week.

But as is common with Samsung smartphone releases, plenty of details about the phone have ostensibly leaked leading up to its launch.

This was given additional weight by Apple's AirPods lead hinting to What HiFi that the company may have plans for achieving the wireless bandwidth needed for lossless audio. However, while I do think this is a likely development, I don't think we should get too excited about it ...

Why AirPods don't currently support lossless audio

The short answer is that they use Bluetooth, and that simply doesn't have the bandwidth needed. The short-range wireless data protocol is used for a huge range of tasks and is the very definition of a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.

Specifically, when it comes to audio, the best Bluetooth can currently achieve is Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). In theory, that can exceed 2Mbps, but in practice often struggles to hit 1Mbps. Either way, it doesn't get anywhere close to the 4.6Mbps needed for true hi-res lossless audio (24-bit, 96kHz).

The signs pointing to AirPods lossless audio this year

Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has directly told us to expect it.

We expect Apple to launch AirPods Pro 2 in 4Q22 with new selling points, including a new form factor design, support for Apple Lossless (ALAC) format, and a charging case that can emit a sound for users to track.

Apple's AirPods lead Gary Geaves didn't directly confirm this but did give a strong hint.

""There's a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth. But it's fair to say that we would like more bandwidth and... I'll stop right there. We would like more bandwidth"", he smiles.

The number-one reason for wanting more audio bandwidth would, of course, be lossless audio support.

Three reasons not to get too excited

However, while the evidence does look good, there are three reasons to temper our excitement.

Most people can't tell the difference

First, and most importantly, most people can't tell the difference between the AAC 256kbps format Apple Music uses as a standard and a true high-res lossless.

That's true even in ideal conditions - closed headphones in a near-silent environment. The truth is that Apple's AAC 256 is a very, very good lossy codec, so even if your ears are good, it's still difficult to distinguish from true lossless audio.

You can test your own ears using an ABX test. Personally, I barely scrape a pass in ideal conditions. In real-world listening on the move (which is where AirPods are mostly used), I wouldn't stand a chance.

Not all lossless audio is equal

If you listen to Qualcomm, the problem is solved. It offers something called aptX Lossless, which is a Bluetooth codec that supports lossless audio. Apple could adopt that, or it could create its own equivalent.

But not all lossless audio is equal. Qualcomm aptX can only transmit lossless audio in 16-bit form at 44.1kHz - that is to say, CD quality. That's not what an audiophile would consider high-res audio (24-bit at 96kHz).

We don't know what tricks Apple has in mind, but one possibility is the company using aptX or similar to achieve CD quality, not hi-res quality.

AirPods will still be AirPods

Lossless audio transmission is one thing; faithful reproduction of the music is something else altogether - and that takes audiophile-grade headphones, or something very close to it.

The cheapest headphones that What HiFi considers worthy of the term are Grado SR325x - and a large part of their secret is that they are open-back (which is less challenging than closed-back), and hence not something you're going to be using in public unless you hate people more than you love music. If you want audiophile-grade earbuds, you're mostly into four-figure territory. All wired, of course.

However much Apple improves this year's AirPods Pro, they aren't going to be audiophile quality - which means even if you can hear the difference on reference headphones, it's exceedingly unlikely you will on AirPods. In truth, AirPods with lossless audio support are mostly going to be a marketing gimmick.

Bluetooth LE Audio is more promising

There is, however, another new Bluetooth standard, which I personally think is more interesting: Bluetooth LE Audio - which includes a clever new codec known as LC3.

The background here is that there are effectively two types of Bluetooth comms: Bluetooth Classic, which is used by wireless headphones, and Bluetooth LE (Low Energy), a much more power-efficient version used for, among other things, communication between your iPhone and Apple Watch.

Bluetooth LE Audio, aims to bring low-power comms to Bluetooth headphones too. On its own, that's already interesting, as it will likely offer substantially improved battery life.

But LE Audio also comes bundled with a new audio codec, LC3. This is a lossy format, but one which promises to be even better than Apple's AAC.

There's a standard five-point perception test, which measures people's ability to hear lossiness in audio transmission, where a score of five is completely imperceptible from lossless. While the standard Bluetooth audio SBS codec only scores just over three at 240kbps, LC3 scores almost 4.5 at just 160kbps, and hits close to five at 240kbps.

For most people, then, Bluetooth LE Audio headphones are going to mean something indistinguishable from lossless quality with greatly improved battery life.

We don't know whether Apple will get on board, but it seems likely - if for no other reason than it won't want to be left behind on battery life. So if and when Apple makes the switch to Bluetooth LE Audio, that will be the point to get excited.

For example, the S&P 500 Information Technology Index sports a dividend yield of just 0.64%.

However, that implies significant room for payout growth over time -- something that many mature technology companies are already delivering. In fact, technology -- the largest sector weight in the S&P 500 -- has been one of that index's steadiest sources of dividend growth for a while now.

Much of that growth is being driven by mature tech companies, such as Dow components Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM).

Cisco is one of the more alluring old school tech names when it comes to dividend dependability.

""Cisco's cybersecurity products give clients the scope, scale and capabilities to keep up with the complexity and volume of threats. Putting security above everything helps corporations innovate while keeping their assets safe,"" according to 24/7 Wall Street. ""Shareholders receive a 2.31% dividend. Credit Suisse has a $73 target price on the Cisco Systems stock, and the consensus target is $62.63. Shares ended Wednesday at $63.96.""

Cisco and semiconductor maker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), another reliable dividend grower, are both members of the SmartETFs Dividend Builder ETF (DIVS).

Texas Instruments ""is also a big Apple supplier, so the long-term outlook for this venerable leader makes it a safer bet for investors with less risk tolerance,"" adds 24/7 Wall Street. ""Investors receive a 2.41% dividend. The BofA Securities price target for Texas Instruments stock is $255. The consensus target is $205.18, and shares closed most recently at $190.81.""

DIVS, which focuses on quality dividend payers with appealing dividend growth prospects, also holds Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), two other titans of tech dividend growth.

We're at the closing fourth quarter of 2021 and the tide of interest is shifting towards the Galaxy S22 series, expected in January, and at the new Snapdragon 8 Gen1-equipped phones.

The new Qualcomm flagship chipset was announced, based on a 4nm node, with a Cortex-X2 core that can run at up to 3.0GHz, three performance Cortex-A710 cores at 2.5GHz, and four Cortex-A510 for efficiency, running at 1.8GHz.

The first official phone to get the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 was Motorola's Edge X30.

Xiaomi ended the year with its 12 series - the 12 and 12 Pro on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 platform, and the 12X with a SD870 chip.

But it was the unofficial Galaxy S22 that dominated the news feed in Q4. Every leak, whether it was a rumor of a specification, an image of reported screen protectors, or a proposition from an insider, was immediately interesting to our readers.

We now have a pretty good idea of what the Galaxy S22 series will be when they are official in January. But throughout the months of October, November, and December we found out the camera details of the three upcoming phones, their design, and their general specs.

It was confirmed that the Galaxy S22 Ultra would have an in-body S Pen. We learned that the Galaxy S22 and S22+ will get new 50MP main cameras and a conventional (read, non-binning) 10MP 3x telephoto, while the S22 Ultra would retain the 108MP, 12MP 0.5x, 10MP 3x and 10MP 10x, but with a big improvement in computational photography.

We saw images of Galaxy S22 series dummies, stacked against current phones, like the Galaxy Note20 Ultra and S21 Ultra. It appears that the Galaxy S22 Ultra will be bigger than its predecessor.

There were a few other major phone announcements in Q4. Google's Pixel 6 duo came out alongside the new in-house Tensor chip. The Pixel 6 duo also ushered in a high-megapixel main camera for the first time in a Pixel.

Huawei's P50 Pocket arrived to challenge the Galaxy Z Fold3. It flaunted a gapless clamshell folding design, a 6.9-inch 120Hz main screen, and a 1-inch circular cover screen, as well as a Snapdragon 888 with 4G.

Finally, the Oppo Find N, the company's first foldable was aimed at a new crowd - those that wanted a phone that unfolded to a big inner display but folded to a small, usable outer one. It was an instant hit. Indeed, it's smaller than the Galaxy Z Fold3 but still has a fairly huge 7.1-inch inside display. While its outer display is a perfectly-usable 5.49-inch 18:9 AMOLED. It only makes it more of a shame that the Find N isn't expected outside of China.

That will do it for 2021. We're eager to get 2022 started, see you there - front page!","{'uri': 'gsmarena.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'GSM Arena'}",[],https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/21/12/top-news-2021/-728x314/gsmarena_000.jpg,0.2470588235294118,eng-7377109,False,0.6039215922355652,0.2470588235294118,378918960,1

The full-color Crystal30 2nd generation waveguide is built using DigiLens' volume bragg gratings (VBG) class of technology and has a measured efficiency rating of over 500 nits per lumen (n/L). This makes the new Crystal30 waveguide the most efficient diffractive waveguide on the market today, and it enables DigiLens partners to create XR experiences that are compatible in both indoor and outdoor bright environments. The 2nd generation waveguide has been configured with a landscape layout and provides customers with the option for a 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio, and it supports 1.2 arc minutes per pixel or 50 pixels per degree (ppd). The <8.5% eye glow of the waveguide is best in class at 5x better than the experience provided by HoloLens 2 and the new Crystal30 waveguide is available with glass or plastic waveguide substrates starting at the end of Q1 2022.

DigiLens is also announcing a first-of-its-kind 30° landscape field-of-view LCoS LED 720p light engine called EnLiten30. Partners will have the option to pair the EnLiten30 projector with the new Crystal30 waveguide when engaging in NRE customization projects with DigiLens starting in Q2 2022. The polarized light engine has a baseline operational efficiency of 5 lumens per half-watt (.5W) and has a targeted max peak brightness of 10 polarized lumens with an ANSI contrast ratio of >100:1 and a frame rate of >60 frames-per-second. It has an optical package size of 2.5cc and a total component size of <4.0cc, and can be constructed in a longitudinal or right-angle exit configuration.

The new phone succeeds the regular Vivo Y21 that debuted in the country in August 2021 and now features a Qualcomm chipset instead of a MediaTek SoC. The design language of both smartphones are more or less the same, but on the specifications side, there are mighty upgrades. Like all Vivo devices, the new Vivo Y21T follows the company's ""commitment to Make in India"" initiative and is manufactured at its Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh facility.

The Vivo Y21T features a larger 6.58-inch LCD display with 2408×1080 pixels (Full-HD+ resolution) and a 90Hz refresh rate. The screen also gets an ""Eye Protection Mode"" to filter out the harmful blue light for a more comfortable viewing experience.

Here's our take.

Foldable smartphones have seen immense growth in terms of innovation and sales. Samsung, which is currently the leading foldable smartphone maker, has witnessed tremendous success in 2021, courtesy of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Galaxy Z Flip 3. To take on the South Korean tech giant, Oppo launched its first foldable smartphone called the Oppo Find N. The Find N is currently available only in China. The device has a similar folding mechanism as the Z Fold 3 but is more compact and gets many things right. Oppo sent us an Oppo Find N review unit, which we used for a few days to understand how the company got so many things right in its first attempt and is also better in many aspects than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3.

Before we begin our Oppo Find N hands-on, here's a look at the specifications of the foldable smartphone.

Oppo Find N hands-on

We did mention that Oppo got many things right with its first foldable smartphone. Although late to the party, the company, directly or indirectly, addressed many concerns that one might have about foldable smartphones. For starters, the crease on the foldable phone

A foldable screen with an almost invisible crease

One of the noticeable ""issues"" with a foldable screen is that the crease is visible right in the centre. While the vertical line is somewhat visible on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 (Review), it is not exactly the case with the Oppo Find N.

Oppo has used a different hinge mechanism for the Find N. It creates a water-drop-shaped fold at the centre part of the screen, which lets the rest of the part fold flat. We have seen something similar in the Moto Razr as well, where the area of the screen around the hinge is rounded on the inside, further ensuring that there is no visible crease. The ""Flexion"" hinge mechanism further allows the device to close completely when folded, unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 3.

Not that the crease hinders the user experience as it is barely visible with a straight line of sight but when viewing something on the screen from the side, you will see that vertical line right in the centre. Oppo's Find N is claimed to offer up to 80 percent crease compared to the other foldable smartphones available commercially. The 7.1-inch foldable screen also refreshes at 120Hz, offering a smooth scrolling experience. It is vibrant and bright for viewing on-screen content in both indoor and outdoor conditions as well.

A usable cover display

One of the complaints we had with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is that its cover display, although tall and edge-to-edge, was not as practically usable due to its 25:9 aspect ratio. Several apps (Instagram, for example) were not optimised for the cover screen, resulting in content getting cropped out on the sides.

The Oppo Find N fixes this with its 18:9 aspect ratio. The phone has a relatively compact 5.49-inch cover display compared to the tall 6.2-inch cover screen on the Z Fold 3. The tiny form factor also helps in giving a ""handy"" feel without having to perform any finger gymnastics.

It is also worth noting that the screen on the right is marginally curved, further offering an immersive viewing experience. I found myself using the cover display a lot more for scrolling through social media and clicking sample shots on the Find N. The foldable display was only used to watch videos on YouTube and Netflix. Maybe that is how a foldable phone should ideally be used to get the best of both worlds.

A bigger battery in a compact body

The Oppo Find N, despite having a relatively compact body, manages to pack a bigger battery compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 3. Although slightly larger, the Find N packs a 4,500 mAh battery compared to a 4400 mAh battery on the Z Fold 3.

While the device does offer a slightly bigger cell, the real-life battery life difference is not much. Both devices offer a full day worth of juice on a single charge. The Find N also charges faster at 33W and it took about an hour and 25 mins to charge the device during my week-long usage.

Quality camera setup

The Find N has a 50MP triple-camera setup and uses the same Sony IMX766 sensor found on the OnePlus 9 (Review) and the Oppo Find X3 Pro. The main sensor clicks well-exposed, detailed images with slightly saturated colours in most cases during daytime. There is also a 16MP ultrawide camera and a 13MP telephoto camera. The 13MP sensor supports 2x optical zoom and the results, like the ultrawide camera, are quite okay. While shooting outdoors, I noticed that the colours of the light blue sky were blown out in order to retain better details in the shadow. It was exactly the opposite for the ultrawide camera. While it managed to not overflow the highlights, the details in the shadows were quite okay.

Oppo's software team has taken advantage of the foldable form factor, allowing users to use one side of the device at a certain angle between 45 degrees and 120 degrees as a tripod. For selfies, you get two 32MP front cameras which get the job done.

Oppo has opted for Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 SoC, which might not be the latest but continues to offer raw power under the hood. You also get up to 12GB of RAM under the hood. Because of that usable cover screen, I found myself playing games on the 5.49-inch cover screen more often. My limited testing with Battlegrounds Mobile India on the Find N did not show any major signs of heating. The phone's rear panel does not marginally warm but that is quite normal for phones with the SD888 chipset.

The phone also comes with stereo speakers which offer a crisp and clear audio experience. I did not miss the 3.5mm headphone while streaming content in a closed setting. That being said, having a 3.5mm headphone jack for a phone with 8mm of thickness would have been nice.

Software tricks up its sleeve

To make use of the foldable form factor, the device comes with custom gestures as well. For starters, a two-finger swipe on the Find N will unlock the split-screen mode.

Users can also save tasks in a split window on the home screen as an icon so when you tap on it the next time, it will load those apps automatically. There is also a Flexform Mode, which divides the screen into two parts, allowing users to use the bottom half of the screen as a keyboard for typing notes.

Not everything is good though

I mentioned some of the best Oppo Find N features above. However, just like every other (foldable) smartphone, the Find N is not a perfect device and comes with its share of cons. For starters, the screen on the outside refreshes at 60Hz compared to 120Hz on the Galaxy Z Fold 3. For a phone launched in the last quarter of 2021, we would expect it to offer a 90Hz refresh rate at least, if not 120Hz. Oppo missed the mark there.

The device also does not come with an official IPX8 rating for water and dust resistance. Samsung gets an edge here to offer a complete smartphone experience without having to worry about water or dust entering the device while clicking photos or videos out in the rain. While this is not a deal-breaker, the Find N also misses out on smart stylus support. It might not be required daily but there have been times wherein I had to sign embargoes digitally and the S Pen on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 was a lot more convenient.

The Find N is also slightly heavier at 275 grams and marginally slimmer at 15.9mm (when folded). Also worth noting is that while the Find N does offer some software tricks, it lags behind Samsung's One UI.","{'uri': 'moneycontrol.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MoneyControl'}",[],https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2022/01/Oppo-Find-N-10-770x433.jpg,0.2313725490196079,eng-7379729,False,0.7411764860153198,0.2313725490196079,378917640,1

If you have heard the joke about Nokia phones at least once in your life, you know where that joke came from. Nokia is a brand that is easily associated with ruggedness, sturdiness, and strength, thanks to its feature phones from the noughties. HMD Global has brought back that virtue of Nokia feature phones to its latest smartphone, XR20.

The brand-new Nokia XR20 is a rugged smartphone, meaning it can survive drops underwater, in extreme cold or hot temperatures, without a hiccup. You may think those features make for a good pitch for someone who works at a construction site or loves to globetrot, but if it did not occur to you, it is equally important for people with small kids at home.

Let us face it. Kids are fascinated by the technology we have around us, and their keen minds will always be so inclined to use it. Smartphones are inseparable from our lives, so when your kid asks you for your phone or if they secretly access it, you are most worried. To keep the thought of a broken phone at bay, HMD came up with the Nokia XR20. In HMD's words, the Nokia XR20 is ""scratch-resistant, drop-resistant, temperature-resistant, water-resistant and kid-and-pet-resistant.""

The Nokia XR20 has a solid body, but all that extra strength costs a premium price. The Nokia XR20 sells for Rs 46,999 in India. It is a price that can get you the top model of flagship-like phones such as Realme GT or iQOO 7 Legend. So does that extra strength make the Nokia XR20 a good phone, and if that price justifies that? I am going to tell you the answer in this review.

Nokia XR20 review: Solid body

If you have used old Nokia phones, which were feature phones, you would know that practically nothing can destroy them. That may be hyperbolic but apt enough to suggest that Nokia means strength. HMD is reusing that concept, and its Nokia XR20 is a testament to that. The Nokia XR20 has one of the brawniest exteriors you will find on a smartphone. You cannot tell that by just looking at the photos. You will have to touch to know. I did, and I can tell you that the phone feels super solid. And heavy. All those extra frills add up to the phone's weight, which is 240 grams.

The Nokia XR20 is not the first rugged phone, but it may perhaps be the prettiest. HMD has crafted this phone with attention to detail, and that shows. For instance, the hard plastic casing around the phone makes it look tough, but the carvings on the side edges reveal aluminium rims and give a premium appearance. Add to that a glass back with patterns, which uses polymer composite for extra durability. For the final touch to ensure total protection, the Nokia XR20 comes with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, which is by far the toughest glass shield used on phones.

You can drop the phone on the floor to test its durability. I am not saying that. HMD does. While I am not too sure if you should deliberately drop the phone on any surface, it is a good assurance that accidental drops will barely leave a scratch on the phone. So give this phone to your kids all you want without needing to fret.

The Nokia XR20 has a USB-C port, a stereo speaker set, two microphones on either side and a 3.5mm headphone jack. I am glad that the phone has the standard features of a premium phone, including dual speakers. The buttons on the phone are more than what you usually see on phones. Apart from the volume rocker and power button on the right side, the phone has a Google Assistant button on the left side. I found myself hitting the Google Assistant button often, and that was because it is not very tactile. A little pressure triggers the voice assistant, and that isn't very pleasant. But you can deactivate the Google Assistant programme for this button if you do not want that.

There is a fifth button on top of the Nokia XR20, and it is sort of an emergency cum feature-centric button. What I mean is that this button is red in colour, and that denotes emergency, which is also the default feature assigned to this button. But it is reprogrammable. You can assign this button to take screenshots, record the screen, and do many things. But you can still use it for contacting emergency contacts by long-pressing the button. That is nifty.

The Nokia XR20 is an unwieldy phone, and that is acceptable by the standards of rugged phones. It is 10.64mm thick and 81.5mm wide, while the length is 171.64mm. I mean, I had a problem maintaining my grip on the phone, and I have big hands. Imagine someone with smaller hands. This phone needs two hands to operate, and that can be inconvenient for many users. So consider this aspect before making the decision to buy this phone.

Ruggedness on this phone also includes water and dust resistance. With an IP68 certification, the Nokia XR20 is good for taking a shower or swimming with you. You can even take calls and use the phone. But keep in mind that the sound may not be clear all the time, and the display's touch sensitivity will need to be enhanced via phone settings for use in such cases. One of these cases is when you have hand gloves on. The Nokia XR20 can easily recognise touches of your gloves - something the iPhone cannot do.

Nokia XR20 review: Good display

Even though the phone's biggest quality is its ruggedness, the Nokia XR20 pays attention to the basic things. For instance, the display is a large 6.67-inch unit crammed into this long phone. The display has a punch-hole in the middle, and it does not look odd at all. But since the design has to fall in line with ruggedness, the display has thick bezels that give it protection. The outer casing juts out from the display and works as a protection for the display in the event of accidental drops. Not that the display is fragile. It uses the Gorilla Glass Victus.

The Full-HD+ resolution on display makes it look crisp and clear. I enjoyed watching Minnal Murali on Netflix in true HD quality, and the stereo speakers were icing on the cake. I could also easily read ebooks on the Kindle app because the brightness of the display is also good. But while you will love the display for everyday tasks and watching shows and movies, you may not like gaming on it. Blame the lack of a high refresh rate. For a phone that costs more than some of the fastest phones, not having at least 90Hz may be a disappointment. But this phone is, anyway, not meant for heavy gaming, so you will not miss the high refresh rate.

Nokia XR20 review: Moderate performance and good battery life

All that ruggedness is one thing, but buying a smartphone that costs around Rs 47,000 has to be based on other crucial factors, such as the chipset and the battery. HMD used a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor inside the phone. This is the entry-level chipset that powers Nokia's other phones that cost much less, as well as entry-level 5G phones from other brands. So get this straight: the Nokia XR20 may look like a premium phone, but it will work like a budget phone.

The Snapdragon 480 SoC is not the fastest but fast enough to handle everyday multitasking. I could easily browse cat videos on Instagram, chat on WhatsApp, check my office emails, and take photos without seeing any lags. But I had to be conservative doing that. I mean, I never had more than five-six apps opened in the background at a time. Smooth animations and the interface make everything look nice and flowy. But if you are thinking of making the Nokia XR20 your gaming device, think elsewhere.

The gaming performance on the Nokia XR20 is below par. That means it is not suitable for playing games in high graphics. You can still play Battlegrounds Mobile India and Call of Duty Mobile on it, but you will have to keep the graphics on the lower side. Personally, I was a bit weirded out. That is because when I played PUBG: New State on the Nokia XR20 in default graphics settings, the screen would show stutters in the software. I began to think that the software was going to crash, so I uninstalled the game immediately. It may be a one-off incident.

I found the Nokia XR20 lasting for more than a day after some hours of playing games, browsing Instagram, chatting on WhatsApp, and watching a Netflix movie. The 4630mAh battery is good for the kind of workload this phone can handle. Charging the battery from zero to full requires around 2 hours 40 minutes with the bundled charger, but you can use a high voltage charger to minimise this time. The phone also supports wireless charging capped at 15W, which can be convenient sometimes.

Nokia XR20 review: Average cameras

It is very rare to find a phone that has fewer than three cameras on the back. The Nokia XR20 belongs to that rarity. It has a 48-megapixel primary camera and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera on the back, sitting inside the island that juts out from the rest of the body a bit. Nokia has given the standard camera features to the Nokia XR20, but some stand out. You have the SpeedWarp mode, which is another name for timelapse mode, and other features such as ZEISS Optics, ZEISS Portrait, and ZEISS Cinematic Effects.

I found myself using the primary camera in most cases. I took photos of things around me, such as flowers, plants, and some items lying at my house. Some images were clicked outdoors with ample sunlight, while some were taken indoors. There is a huge shift in colours between the photos taken in these two scenarios, and that is not good. For instance, the bougainvillaea flower in the photo has a good dynamic range and retains the original orange colour, which is also good, but, at the same time, the sticker on the bottle of snacks shows murkiness. You will like photos taken in daylight but may need to edit the ones taken indoors to make them appealing.

IMAGE SAMPLES

You can also use night mode to brighten the photos, but the resulting images have blurriness towards the edges. It seems as if there is a blurred vignette in these photos, and I am not sure whether that makes the images look good. The ultra-wide-angle camera clicks a lot of things in sight but does not retain their original colour or details. I think this camera could have been a bit better, considering it is Nokia we are talking about.

I clicked selfies, too, but never found myself appreciating them. The photos are detailed, but the colours seem a bit washed off. Using a portrait sensor gives depth to pictures, but the edge detection is slightly off for hair strands.

The Nokia XR20 can record 1080p videos at a maximum of 60fps, which may be disappointing for some users. Although powered by ZEISS Optics, the videos lack stabilisation, so you will have to use a gorilla pod or a tripod for stability in videos. The videos recorded by the phone look average, but you will appreciate the stereo sound recording in them, thanks to Nokia's OZO technology.

Nokia XR20 review: Should you buy it?

The Nokia XR20 is not your regular phone. While the set of its qualities is a bit aloof, its price means it is not for everyone. The Nokia XR20's price of Rs 46,999 pits it against some of the highly capable smartphones in the premium segment. Some of them are cheaper and yet better in terms of specifications. For instance, the Snapdragon 888-powered Realme GT starts at Rs 37,999, while the OnePlus 9R costs Rs 39,999. If you can spend a few more thousand, you can get an iPhone.

But it is not a question of how much you can spend. It is the question of what you want your phone to be. Do you want it to be the sturdiest device in the sea of fragile phones? If yes, Nokia XR20 is for you. This phone may not give you the fastest gaming experience or the best photography performance, but it surely can give you peace of mind. You can use the phone in extreme conditions, and the rugged Nokia XR20 can handle it. If you are someone who breaks their phone's screen often, the Nokia XR20 is for you. It is also a good phone for parents of small kids, as well as those who work in extreme conditions.

Now, OnePlus India via OnePlus.in has confirmed the launch date of the upcoming OnePlus products. As per the official announcement, both these products will launch in India on January 14th. With this teaser, OnePlus also puts rumors to the rest which claimed that the company will rebrand the OnePlus 9RT as OnePlus RT for the Indian market.

Alongside the OnePlus official website, a micro-site for the upcoming launch has also gone live on amazon.in. OnePlus took it to Social media channels and OnePlus Community forum to make an announcement, take a look at social media post below,

To recall, the OnePlus 9RT 5G and the OnePlus Buds Z2 were launched back in October in the Chinese market. The OnePlus Buds Z2 recently launched outside China, but the 9RT has been exclusive to the Chinese market.

The OnePlus 9RT flaunts a 6.62-inch Full HD+ fluid AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. The display panel houses an optical fingerprint scanner and also a punch-hole notch. Powering the device is an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and Adreno 660 GPU. The handset packs LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage.

In the optics department, the OnePlus 9RT gets a 50MP Sony IMX766 sensor, a 16MP ultra-wide-angle lens and a 2MP macro lens. For selfies, it offers a 16MP shooter. The smartphone is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery unit and 65W fast-charging support. It also packs in a USB Type-C charging port, an alert slider, and a dual stereo speaker setup. Though, it lacks a 3.5mm audio jack, so audio is also routed through the Type-C port.

The OnePlus 9RT is said to cost somewhere between Rs 40,000-44,000 and launch in two configurations - 8GB + 128GB and 12GB + 256GB storage variants. The OnePlus Buds Z2 might retail for Rs. 4,999 in India. What's your guess on the pricing of these products?

Though ASUS isn't having a huge portfolio when it comes to smartphones, every year a flagship Zenfone and gaming-centric ROG Phone is expected and this year is no exception. As CES starts tomorrow, many of the electronics, smartphones and PC brands will be announcing their plans and new products. Though we haven't heard anything from ASUS regarding CES this time, it is quite sure that ASUS doesn't want to get left behind when it comes to launching new phones with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and those phones could be the ASUS Zenfone 6 and ROG Phone 6.

Though it's not confirmed yet when ASUS will bring these phones, some sketches were leaked online, revealing the designs of the phones and it looks like ASUS wants to carry its legacy of bringing phones with unique designs that benefit users. As per the latest report from EqualLeaks, the Zenfone 9 will bring a significant change over the Zenfone 8, that's being currently sold internationally except in a few regions, including India.

The Zenfone 8 and Zenfone 8 Flip from ASUS were quite different. The Zenfone 8 Flip, as the name suggests, came with a flip camera mechanism, that got quite popular overnight and it was something fresh. But with Zenfone 9, the company is dumping the flip camera and going for a more conventional-looking camera setup on the back. At least that is what this screenshot reveals, found in ZenTalk Forums.

However, the report claims that there will be a secondary display beside the camera module. Below the camera module and the secondary display, the area would be mostly clean and ASUS may have added an in-display fingerprint scanner instead of a back-mounted one. However, the back is also sensitive to touch and users will be able to use simple touch gestures on the back to trigger simple actions like taking a photo or screenshot or turning the flashlight on or off.

The ROG Phone 6 and ROG Phone 6 Pro could be two identical devices in terms of the designs when compared to the ROG Phone 5. However, the camera placement will be a bit different. On the ASUS ROG Phone 6, there will be the ROG logo alongside the ROG Phone 6 branding while on the ROG Phone 6 Pro, there is only the ROG logo.

Right at the end of December, the phone was accidentally listed on Samsung UK and Ireland's website. Prior to that, its variants and prices were revealed and tipsters revealed that the phone will come with a 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED display and 32-megapixel selfie camera. However, just a day before the CES, Samsung India has started teasing the phone, quite evident from the tweet below.

The header for the account has also changed, and we're being constantly reminded that 'Epic is coming', alongside a colour theme consisting of four colours- Graphite, White, Olive, and Lavender. These could be the four colour variants in which the Galaxy S21 FE would launch.

We can confirm that it's indeed the Galaxy S21 FE because in the tweet, there is a link to register and it leads to a link that explicitly mentions 'Galaxy S21 FE'. However, the social media handles of Samsung in other regions are still silent and there seems to be no word from them regarding the Galaxy S21 FE. Though the teaser is about S21 FE, that's sure, we are still waiting to hear officially from Samsung and the company has not revealed anything about the smartphone yet.

Now that new leadership is in place at both the FTC and DOJ, additional initiatives to undercut patentees' legitimate property rights may be expected soon. Look to the FTC, likely joined by the Justice Department (DOJ), to revive its Obama-era crusade against standard essential patent (SEP) holders' efforts to obtain fair returns to their property. New DOJ policies toward standard setting arrangements (as foreshadowed by DOJ's 2021 disavowal of the Trump Administration's approach to SSO policy) aimed at weakening the leverage of SEP holders and favoring implementers over patentees are likely. One possible constraint on agency litigation attacking SEP and other patent rights is the judiciary. The 9 Circuit's 2020 Qualcomm decision overturning an FTC antitrust challenge to Qualcomm's licensing practices demonstrates that many federal court remain open to fully weighing companies' efficiency justifications for restrictive patent licensing arrangements.

Looking outside the United States, I would say: (1) expect the Unified Patent Court to start functioning in the second half of 2022, or early 2023, (2) watch out for any impact the reforms may (or may not) have which were introduced in Germany in summer 2021 regarding the granting of injunctions for patent infringement and trying to speed up the time between filing a nullity suit and getting a qualified (preliminary) opinion from the Federal Patent Court on patent validity, (3) keep an eye on further decisions in the DABUS case (about whether an AI machine can be named an as inventor in a patent application) - including a possible UK Supreme Court judgment if they take the case, and (4) look out for further jurisdictional disputes in global FRAND litigation.

In 2021, we saw a significant shift in the digital world, with both brands and consumers focusing on new digital offerings, such as the creation and purchase of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual fashion in the metaverse. These trends will continue to expand in 2022, likely bringing with them a host of legal disputes. For instance, production company Miramax has already filed a high-profile copyright litigation against director Quentin Tarantino following the announcement that he would auction off Pulp Fiction-related NFTs. The case raises the questions of who has the rights to mint and sell an NFT of any already existing work and is one to watch to see if it helps clarify some of these murky issues.

To help protect against infringement of IP rights in the metaverse, we've seen a host of brands - from Nike, to Allbirds, to cosmetics company Bobbi Brown - file applications for trademark registrations for goods and services in the metaverse. In addition to registrations, policing their brands will continue to be critical to prevent weakening or diluting their marks. And disputes like these also already exist. For instance, artist Mason Rothschild recently dropped 100 ""MetaBirkins"" NFTs - digital versions of the famed Hermès' Birkin Bags - to raise awareness of ""fur-free"" and ethical alternative textiles. Hermès has denounced the project as infringing, but has not yet filed suit. This case - and others that will follow - will be sure to raise interesting and unresolved questions of First Amendment protection for expressive works, among other issues.

I would expect the unexpected in 2022. The slate has been wiped clean over the last two years, and this is a new beginning. New companies that rapidly build patent portfolios designed to achieve specific business objectives will seemingly come out of nowhere. These companies will quickly attract venture capital, which is at or near record levels and achieve very high valuations. These new companies could begin to either bypass - or get acquired by - more established industry players that are less nimble with their IP strategies. It will be interesting to see if some early stage innovative companies and their maverick leaders will resist acquisition by yesterday's companies and instead seek to disrupt and displace them, perhaps for ideological or generational-shift reasons. Not to mention possible regulatory scrutiny related to such acquisitions.

It will also be interesting to see rates of innovation between North America, Europe, and Asia, as today's patent filings are the seeds of tomorrow's companies. For example, who will have the lead in electric and autonomous vehicle innovation, in vaccine development and other pharmaceutical efforts, and in de-carbonization technology? These are important spaces to watch as they will be early identifiers of the centers of gravity for tomorrow's economy.

My work as an IP valuation and litigation expert is usually a good compass as to what direction the market is going, and I am seeing three trends going into 2022. One is the noticeable increase in leveraging IP assets for funding, either as a collateral for debt funding or as a valuation driver for equity funding; the assets being leveraged include patent portfolios only or entire IP portfolios. While better valuation tools are still needed, the deals seem to be flowing at higher rates than ever before. The Second trend we are seeing is the emergence of digital assets including data, NFTs, blockchain-based assets, and entire virtual worlds waiting to be explored. Meta (previously Facebook) made the opening shot which brought the Metaverse into the main stream, and has given a new meaning to the term ""intangible assets"". Anyone not paying attention to this, will be left behind. Finally, the third trend that I have seen accelerate over the past 5-10 years is the interaction of patent law and family law. Divorce cases involving patents (and other types of IP) are a hot new area, where the issues are as complex as in any corporate litigation case. We expect to see more of these cases come along as the family assets (like the corporate assets) are becoming more intangible.

I am looking forward with some trepidation to the Supreme Court's decision in American Axle & Manufacturing Inc. v. Neapco Holdings LLC. The issues before the Court are (1) What standard determines whether a patent claim is ""directed to"" a patent-ineligible concept under step 1 of the Supreme Court's two-step framework for determining whether an invention is eligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. § 101; and (2) whether patent eligibility (at each step of the Supreme Court's two-step framework) is a question of law for the court based on the scope of the claims or a question of fact for the jury based on the state of art at the time of the patent. Optimists hope that the Supreme Court will reign in the damage caused by the Mayo and Alice decisions and provide greater clarity to the law of patent subject matter eligibility. Pessimists are of the opinion that the Supreme Court is not likely to role back the clock to the 1980s when Diamond v. Diehr and Diamond v. Chakrabarty were decided. If nothing else this is a major case to watch for in 2022.

First, courts and governments in key jurisdictions will reveal their positions on AI, with most opting to keep the status quo or adapting AI to existing IP doctrines.

Second, the legislative and executive branches of government will weigh in on the weaponizing of antisuit injunctions. This may be an important first step to developing a code of conduct, perhaps within the context of plurilateral trade agreements.

Third, we will see the emergence of more truly international IP meetings. With virtual and hybrid events becoming the norm, the ease of both attending and speaking at such events allow more voices that have thus far been largely absent to participate and be heard. We have much to learn from each other. The humility, willingness, and now the ability to do so seamlessly, can only bode well for the inextricably interconnected IP issues we face.

A major part of the USPTO Director's official role is to be a principal advisor to the president on all IP policy matters. However, the current administration requested comments on revising the 2019 Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents before the new USPTO Director - as with the DOJ's new head of antitrust - was even confirmed. This has continued a trend of ideologically driven decisions by the White House on IP issues. In 2022, I will be watching to see if this trend continues with regards to decisions on how the USPTO operates. Will the White House try to roll back former Director Andrei Iancu's efforts to bring balance to the PTAB? Will the White House allow new USPTO Director Kathi Vidal - after she's confirmed - to pursue meaningful efforts to fix the Section 101 mess she eloquently described during her confirmation hearings?

The ITC is already a critically important venue for patent holders. But, with the lack of U.S. production being recently highlighted by semiconductor and overall supply chain shortages, on-shoring of production may open up the ITC doors to a host of industries going forward. Moreover, as the PTAB moves away from deferring to district court trials dates that are rarely accurate, the ITC offers the best venue for patent assertion given the exclusionary relief and chance to shut-down the PTAB (should Fintiv practices continue). As such, I expect the ITC to become increasingly prominent in IP disputes for 2022 and beyond.

In 2022, the big issues to keep an eye on will be related to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). At some point during Q1 2022, we can expect that Kathi Vidal will be confirmed as the next Director of the Patent and Trademark Office. During her Senate Confirmation hearing she was asked about the Office exercising discretion to refuse to institute inter partes review challenges, an issue that has brought the ire of Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), who says that was never the intention of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. The Supreme Court has confirmed that the Patent Office has the authority to exercise discretion to refuse IPRs, Leahy and others who ideologically favor implementers and believe ""bad patents"" are used to harass them in litigation disagree. Leahy has submitted the Restoring America Invents Act to, among other things, undercut discretion to refuse to institute IPRs. Regardless of whether Leahy gets this legislative victory, expect him and others within the administration who are philosophically aligned with implementers to pressure Vidal to not only significantly cut back on discretionary denials, but to also undo many of the other PTAB reforms introduced by Trump-era USPTO Director, Andrei Iancu. So far, what public statements Vidal has made, do not suggest that she will come into the Office with an intent to significantly disrupt the current trajectory of the Office, including the PTAB. As with all agency policy, however, that can change in an instant.

In the trademark space we see two interesting trends developing in 2022. Firstly, trademark filing activity has been setting records around the world each year since 2010 driven in particular by domestic growth in China and targeting of U.S. and European trademark registers by Chinese applicants. If Q4 2021 is any indication, this growth trend is likely to stop in 2022 with major trademark registers seeing a decrease in trademark filing activity for the first time in over a decade. On top of strong signs that Chinese domestic trademark filing volume is falling in recent months, the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) announced sanctions in December 2021 that cancelled over 15,000 US Trademark records filed from China, sending a strong signal that the USPTO is looking to protect the register against questionable high-volume filers. This will have a significant impact on confidence in China among sellers considering applying for a US trademark simply to provide smooth access to online retail platforms.

The second trend that we will be monitoring in 2022 relates to a virtual world. When Facebook announced a rebrand to Meta in October 2021, the world started to take notice of a version of a proposed version of an online universe called the metaverse. A place where online experiences are supercharged by virtual reality and interactivity, the metaverse has the potential to significantly change the way brands interact with consumers, and might also impact trademark law. Fashion and luxury brands are already filing trademark applications in Class 9 for virtual goods. Already the most crowded class on most registers, if the virtual counterpart of every physical item is going to be filed in Class 9 going forwards, authorities will need to rethink the Nice Classification system. There is also the possibility that new, 3-D interactive logos - such as those adopted recently by Meta and Block (formerly Square) will require more modern trademark types to be introduced as they currently do not neatly fit into the existing categories.","{'uri': 'ipwatchdog.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law'}",[],https://www.ipwatchdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-road-Depositphotos_510734760_XL-1.jpg,0.2313725490196079,eng-7381804,False,0.6000000238418579,0.2313725490196079,378916020,2

Leaks suggest UI improvements and new designs and hardware upgrades. Here's everything you've ever known about the OnePlus 10 Pro.

OnePlus 10 Pro Release Date and Design

OnePlus CEO Pete Lau had previously confirmed on Weibo that the OnePlus 10 Pro will be available later this month. However, a recent leak from Tarekomi's Abhishek Yadav suggests a January 11 launch, backed by a promotional video for the Chinese market.

According to this leaked video from Weibo, the OnePlus 10 Pro was released on January 11, 2022. https: //t.co/Ww4xlK9Phd#OnePlus #Oppo pic.twitter.com/MhcQxBFkIw

Judging from the video, this device has a curved display with a punched selfie camera in the upper left corner of the screen. The back side has a matte finish, and the Hasselblad branded triple camera setup extends to the side panels. The phone will be available in four colors: black, turquoise, purple and silver (metallic), with buttons on both sides.

OnePlus 10 Pro Specifications and Hardware

The OnePlus 10 Pro, like its Vanilla OnePlus 10 variant, is expected to boot with the new Unified OS software that incorporates collaboration with Oppo. It is described as a blend of Oxygen OS and Oppos Color OS and will soon be available on older OnePlus devices up to OnePlus 8.

Internally, you can expect the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. This is 20% faster than the Snapdragon 888 on the OnePlus 9. Lau has already checked the processor. The OnePlus 10 Pro features a 6.7-inch QHD + display, a 120Hz variable refresh rate and an LTPO 2.0 panel. For storage, you can expect up to 256GB and 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM.

The new 2nd generation Hasselblad camera setup consists of a 48MP primary sensor, a 50MP ultra-wide camera, and an 8MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. On the front is a 32MP camera for selfies and video calls. The OnePlus 10 Pro will be powered by a 5000mAh battery that supports 80W wired and 50W wireless fast charging. The OnePlus 10 and 10 Pro smartphones will be launched in China before any other region.

It's 2022 and what we are expecting from the Cupertino-based tech giant Apple are multiple exciting devices. Ranging from the most-expected iPhone SE, iPhone 14, which may come sans-notch, a new redesigned MacBook Air, iMac and the long-awaited wearable Apple Airpods may be rolled out this year. Here we have compiled an Apple launches list in 2022 for you.

Besides iPhone 14, you can expect a newer version of the iPhone SE this year which will have the same design as the available iPhone SE right now. According to the leaks and rumours, iPhone SE will sport a 4.7-inch display and the Touch-ID Home Display button that was previously only available on older models. The smartphone is expected to include an A14 or A15 chipset as well as a 5G modem. Despite the fact that the size of smartphones hasn't changed, still, Apple is expected to launch the new product iPhone SE Plus.

The most rumoured smartphone, which is actively being in news for its expected features, the flagship iPhone line-up of Apple, iPhone 14 may launch in 2022 for the first time without the notch display. If we believe the leaks and rumours, then the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max variants would use punch-hole cameras with 48 MP sensors. Tech breakthroughs in camera sensors and lens technology, the trio rear camera setup may not be laid out on the next iPhone 14 at the back.

Also, there were reports that the next-generation iPhone will be without a SIM slot, and will only be equipped with an eSIM option. The A16 technology is likely to be used in the iPhone 14 series, which will provide higher power and efficiency. Qualcomm's X65 5G chips, which offer faster connectivity and up to 2TB of onboard storage, could be used.

New year and a new redesigned Apple's MacBook Air, what a combination! The new MacBook Air is expected to come with a new design and an M2 chipset. Also, it is expected to be much thinner and lighter.

Apple's next Watch Series 8 is expected to bring new health features such as blood glucose monitoring, blood pressure, temperature sensor and many more. It was also previously rumoured that the company may launch a durable version of the watch for athletes, hikers, or anyone who uses the watch in harsh environments.

This year, the AirPods Pro 2 may be released this year, with features such as lossless audio support and surprisingly leaks suggested that its charging case will also play music! Seems like the mashup of earbuds and mini-speaker!

Well, these are just the expected gadgets from Apple that may launch in 2022.

Samsung just announced the arrival of the Galaxy S21 FE. In 2021, rumors of delays and cancellations plagued the Galaxy S21 FE, leaving tech pundits wondering about the fate of the popular, budget-friendly Android line.

On the other hand, recent bits of gossip that came from respected Twitter leaker @OnLeaks contradicted those aforementioned rumors. They claimed that the Galaxy S21 FE is on track for a CES 2022 announcement. A leak from Korean blog Naver aligned with this claim. As it turns out, they're both right. Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy S21 FE for the new year.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE is packed with an ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset, a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 240Hz touch respoonse rate and a 120Hz refresh rate. With all of these fantastic features working in conjuction with each other, the Galaxy S21 FE should deliver a powerful, smooth user experience for gaming and streaming.

The Galaxy S21 FE also comes with a pro-grade camera system. Professionals and amateurs alike can capture photos and videos, and edit them in any environment. Thanks to the Night Mode option, users can enjoy enhanced low-light shots and capture crystal-clear photos.

The advanced 32MP front-facing camera captures high-quality selfies for users who love sharing their best selves on social media. The camera also applies AI-powered Face Restoration, ensuring that you look your best in every shot.

If you're gung-ho about security, you'll be happy to know that Samsung's intuitive One UI 4 interface tightens privacy, thanks to the new privacy dashboard that brings security and privacy controls into one central hub. There are also a better variety of customization options, allowing users to tweak almost everything, including the home screen, notifications and icons.

The Galaxy S21 FE comes in four attractive colors: Olive Green, Lavender, White and Graphite.

The LED lights are supposed to guide the learners in a better way. Read details here.

Samsung is popular for manufacturing some of the best Android gadgets. However, the company also delivers a bunch of innovative devices time and again. For instance, Samsung created a blazing fast SSD that delivers data reading speed of up to 13,000MB/s, making it twice as fast as the last generation of SSDs based on PCle 4.0. Most recently, Samsung's Creative Lab has unveiled a project called ZamStar, which is essentially a smart guitar paired with a collaborative platform for creatives and musicians.

The ZamStar project from Samsung Creative Labs comprises of ZamString, a smart guitar and the ZamStar application for musicians to collaborate. The developers of ZamStar claim that it is the ""easiest way to learn an instrument and play together."" Samsung Creative Labs has also created a dedicated landing page that features a video about the device. Check the link to the dedicated landing page here: https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor/detail/zamstar.

The smart Samsung guitar named ZamString includes LED lights on the fretboard. The LED lights are supposed to guide the learners in a better way. The idea behind developing the device is to help novice players learn the instrument. The smart Samsung guitar is accompanied by a companion application called the ZamStar app, which can be installed on smartphones. The application synchronizes with the LED lights on the smart guitar and guides the user with relevant instructions.

While the ZamStar application helps users in learning how to play the guitar, it also provides some interesting processing effects. For instance, the user can add various sound effects from the application to a recording. Users can play and record tunes and add a distortion patch to it with the ZamStar application. Additionally, the application can stack multiple layers of recordings to produce a complete track. More details about the product will be revealed at the CES 2022. However, there is no word on the expected pricing of Samsung Smart Guitar yet.

True wireless earphones are often considered too mainstream to be audiophile-grade, but some brands and products have tried to strike a balance between good sound and the convenience of the form factor. A simple way to improve sound quality is by supporting advanced Bluetooth codecs, which allow for more data to be transferred between the source device and earphones, resulting in richer sound. Lypertek, a small audio specialist brand that focuses on true wireless earphones, has gone a step further with a hybrid triple-driver setup.

Following the excellent Lypertek Tevi is the latest product from the company, the Lypertek PurePlay Z7, which is priced at Rs. 15,999 in India. This pair of true wireless earphones has a hybrid triple-driver setup in each earpiece and Bluetooth 5.2 with support for the Qualcomm aptX Adaptive codec, making it an impressive option on paper. So is this the best sounding pair of true wireless earphones for less than Rs. 20,000? Find out in this review.

The Lypertek PurePlay Z7 has physical buttons on the earpieces for controls

The design of the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 is much like that of the Tevi, with big, bulky earpieces and physical buttons for controls. I got a proper in-canal fit with the Lypertek PurePlay Z7, and I found the earpieces comfortable. However, their sheer size could be a bit unsettling for some people. They look a bit awkward when worn, and I was constantly worried about them falling out when I wasn't sitting down.

Physical buttons instead of touch-sensitive zones are a bit bothersome, particularly on a premium headset such as this. Pressing the buttons on the Lypertek PurePlay Z7's earpieces often shook their already precarious fit in my ears. The controls themselves are easy to learn and get used to, and cover the basics of functionality including playback and volume adjustment.

A press on either side plays and pauses music; a double-press adjusts the volume up or down depending on whether you press the left or right earpiece; and a triple-press skips to the previous or next track. A long-press on the right invokes the default voice assistant on your smartphone. All of these are the default controls, and can be changed using the app.

The earpieces are rated IPX5 for water resistance. The sales package includes a USB Type-C cable for charging, small dust covers for the earpiece outlets, three pairs of silicone ear tips, and three pairs of foam ear tips in different sizes. Although I do usually like foam ear tips, the ones in the package didn't give me a very good fit, and I preferred how the silicone ones felt.

The charging case is similar to that of the Lypertek Tevi, with a fabric-wrapped exterior and Lypertek logo at the top, but it is a fair bit longer. The case holds the rather large battery, and has a USB Type-C port for charging and a small indicator light at the front. There's also Qi wireless charging. While the case was a bit too large to comfortably fit in my pocket, the additional battery capacity was a useful trade-off. The charging case dies look good, but the earpieces still look a bit too ordinary for the price.

The Lypertek PurePlay Z7 works with the PureControl app on both iOS and Android. This app allows you to modify the controls, adjust the equaliser, turn on the LDX audio mode (more on that later), and adjust a few other basic settings on the headset. Most functions work fine even without the app, so you don't necessarily need to have it installed.

The triple-driver setup on the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 features two balanced armature drivers and one dynamic driver in each earpiece

The Lypertek PurePlay Z7 has a hybrid triple-driver setup, consisting of two balanced armature drivers and one dynamic driver in each earpiece. The frequency response range is 20-20,000Hz. There is also Bluetooth 5.2 for connectivity, with support for the Qualcomm aptX and aptX Adaptive Bluetooth codecs, as well as Qualcomm cVc 8.0 environmental noise cancellation for voice. There is no active noise cancellation on the PurePlay Z7, but there is a basic hear-through mode to allow some ambient listening through the otherwise isolating in-canal fit.

Battery life on the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 is very good, with the earpieces running for around 8 hours per charge with the Qualcomm aptX Adaptive codec in operation at moderate volume levels. The charging case added an additional six full charges to the earpieces, for a total battery life of well over 50 hours per charge cycle.

On any kind of headphones or earphones, good hardware is the primary factor that ensures competent audio performance, and the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 is suitably equipped. However, these earphones will perform better with an Android smartphone that supports the aptX Adaptive and aptX codecs in operation.

The Lypertek PurePlay Z7 is designed primarily around the music listening experience, as opposed to all-rounders that might also prioritise two-way voice communication. Bluetooth connectivity was stable as well, and audio performance with high-resolution audio tracks from Apple Music was just about as good as you can expect from a pair of true wireless earphones.

Starting with Voyager by Daft Punk, the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 offered the kind of sonic signature you can expect from a multi-driver setup; there was detail, definition, and cohesiveness across the frequency range in this soothing, yet catchy electronic track. Each part of the range sounded distinct, with the three drivers ably sharing the load. The drivers are tuned for music, and reacted well to the constantly changing feel of the track. The lows and bass, handled by the single dynamic driver in each earpiece, sounded tight, aggressive, and beautifully refined.

Battery life on the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 is excellent, with over 50 hours of listening time per charge cycle

With the slow but haunting Need Your Heart (Minnesota Remix) by Adventure Club, the interplay between the three drivers was at its finest, and the deep bass of this dubstep track felt engaging and strong. The mid-range and highs, handled by the balanced armature drivers, were equally distinct and cohesive; never held back even through the powerful lows thanks to the unique nature of the hybrid triple-driver setup.

With its excellent tuning and driver setup, the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 made for impressive levels of detail. Listening to Let's Groove by Earth, Wind & Fire, it was possible to hear even the faintest elements in this track with surprising precision, all while the punchy lows and quick beats continued to rightly be at the centre of the listening experience. Indeed, it's a wholesome sound that covers everything with natural sonic signature as well as impressive detail and drive.

On the downside, I had quite a few issues with the Pure Control app on both iOS and Android. It often did not detect the headset even when properly paired and connected. That said, the app offered no significant value or utility after the initial setup process. LDX audio mode, which is said to activate a custom audio profile for enhanced performance, made no noticeable difference to sound quality. The hear-through mode barely had any effect on being able to hear ambient sound even with no music playing.

Although connectivity was stable during my time with the Lypertek PurePlay Z7, I did experience some issues. Often, the earpieces didn't turn off when placed in the charging case, and kept playing music even with the lid shut. I had to reposition the earpieces and hold the lid shut tightly for a few seconds to force the Z7 to power down.

On a couple of occasions, the earphones powered on and connected to my smartphone even though the case was shut and was in a backpack untouched. This drained power without my knowledge and could have interfered with phone usage. These are likely design and build quality issues with my specific review unit, but are worth mentioning nonetheless.

Call quality was very ordinary; although voice pickup was acceptable in quiet areas, I wasn't too pleased with what I could hear, and callers complained that my voice sounded a bit soft when I was outdoors. On the whole, this pair of earphones only really performs well when listening to music, and isn't the ideal choice for use as an everyday all-purpose true wireless headset.

The Lypertek Tevi was one of my favourite true wireless headsets of 2020, and I was looking forward to reviewing the PurePlay Z7 for that very reason. When it comes to sound quality, the Z7 doesn't disappoint, putting its hybrid triple-driver setup and codec support to good use. Indeed, sound performance comes close to what you might expect from more expensive options such as the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2, and I quite enjoyed my time with this headset. There's also wireless charging and excellent battery life.

That said, there's not much else the Lypertek PurePlay Z7 gets right. The fit is precarious, the controls are old-fashioned, the app barely worked for me, call quality is underwhelming, and there's no active noise cancellation despite the price. You're definitely getting sound that matches the price, but the limitations of this headset hold it back from being as useful as similarly priced options such as the Jabra Elite 85t and Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro.","{'uri': 'gadgets.ndtv.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NDTV Gadgets 360'}",[],https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/lypertek_pureplay_z7_review_cover_1641200765525.jpg,0.4666666666666666,,False,0,0.4666666666666666,378912780,3

In a Twitter post on Samsung's official account on December 30, 2021, the Korean electronics manufacturer announced the unveiling of the new flagship CPU for January 11, 2022. The successor to the Exynos 2100 is expected to serve as the new centerpiece of the Samsung Galaxy S22 lineup, powering smartphones in some parts of the world.

#PlaytimeIsOver. The gaming marketplace is about to get serious. Stay tuned for the next #Exynos with the new GPU born from RDNA 2. January 11, 2022. source: Twitter-Samsung 12/30/2021

Most excitingly, the Exynos 2200 SoC was created in collaboration with AMD, one of the leading manufacturers of computer GPUs. This could make Exynos 2200 a true graphics powerhouse for smartphones. This is because Samsung is using AMD's latest RDNA2 graphics architecture, which is normally used in high-end consoles and in gaming PCs.

Samsungs seems to stick to the successful strategy from 2021 in 2022. Meaning, there will be an SoC showcase that shines a big spotlight on the new smartphones coming a few weeks later. So Exynos 2200 will most likely be used in Galaxy S22 models. Like every year, the question remains as to which regions Samsung will rely on its own SoCs.

Traditionally, Samsung uses its own SoCs in their flagship devices globally, but for the US market, Samsung usually relies on Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors. The American chip manufacturer already introduced the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 last year, and the first phone that uses the power of the new processor, the Xiaomi 12, was also introduced in China.

We expect to find out the answer to our questions on January 11. As a gamer, I'm also absolutely curious to see if Samsung will team up with AMD to offer some exclusive advantages in currently popular mobile games.

It's a daring decision by the Consumer Technology Association, the industry trade group that sponsored the annual extravaganza -- one that runs the risk of creating a superspreader event. CTA President Gary Shapiro contends the company has taken every possible safety precaution, requiring vaccinations and masks, and handing out self-test kits to all attendees. CES was held in an all-virtual format in January 2021

Many larger companies have withdrawn from in-person participation in the show. T-Mobile US (ticker: TMUS ) CEO Mike Sievert canceled a planned keynote, and General Motors ( GM ) CEO Mary Barra will deliver her keynote virtually. Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Mercedes, Meta ( FB ), Procter & Gamble (PG), Lenovo, Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ), and many others have decided not to participate in person. Many news outlets have also opted out of live coverage, including tech publications such as CNET, Engadget, and the Verge. But despite many predictions to the contrary, CTA declined to cancel CES.

""CES will and must go on,"" Shapiro wrote . ""It will have many more small companies than large ones. It may have big gaps on the show floor. Certainly, it will be different from previous years. It may be messy. But innovation is messy. It is risky and uncomfortable. I view CES as representing the best of our unique American history -- a place where those who are different and have big ideas can gather. Where success is not based on class or religion or anything but the strength of an idea.""

Shapiro added that canceling the show would ""hurt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators who have made investments in building their exhibits and are counting on CES for their business, inspiration and future.""

Key themes at this year's event will include autonomous and electric vehicles, health and wellness products and the development of the metaverse. Keynote speakers will include Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) CEO Robert Ford and Samsung Electronics CEO Jong-Hee Han, in addition to GM's Barra. Peloton Interactive (PTON) CEO John Foley will speak at the CTA's annual ""Leaders in Technology"" dinner.

But the biggest story at CES 2022 undoubtedly will be how event organizers, exhibitors, and attendees cope with Covid. Focus will be on the effectiveness of CTA's safety protocols, the smaller crowds, and personal choices on whether to attend the event at all.

The CES show floor will be open for three days, down from the usual four, starting on Wednesday -- on Friday, CTA announced that it was reducing this year's event by a day. ""The step was taken as an additional safety measure to the current health protocols that have been put in place for CES,"" CTA said. A few companies have been shifted to virtual press events -- including Bosch, Hisense, and Intel (INTC).

This year's event will include the CES debut of a new section of the Las Vegas Convention Center, the West Hall; CES won't be using the Old South Hall of the LVCC. One way to get around will be via built by Elon Musk's Boring Co. that ferries passengers via Tesla ( TSLA ) vehicles. Exhibition space in The Venetian will again host another group of exhibitors, while press day events will take place at the Mandalay Bay convention center.

Barron's plans to provide updates from the event throughout the week.

Chinese smartphone company Poco might be gearing up to launch its next device Poco M4 which is expected to be a cheaper variant of the Poco M4 Pro launched globally back in November 2021. Poco M4 will be a successor device to Poco M3 which was launched last year in February and came with a Snapdragon 662 chipset along with a triple rear camera setup consisting of a 48MP main camera. According to a report from MySmartPrice which cited a leak from renowned tipster Mukul Sharma, the launch timeline and specifications for the upcoming Poco M4 have surfaced online.

Poco M4 is expected to launch globally and in Asian markets in the month of February if the rumours are to be believed. The launch in the Asian markets might include India as well but nothing is confirmed as of now. An official statement about the handset is still awaited from the company. It is also being speculated that the device will come in a similar price range as its predecessor Poco M3.

Talking about the specifications of the device, Poco M4 is tipped to come with a display featuring an LCD panel just like Poco M3 and a 90Hz refresh rate. It is expected that the device will be powered by a MediaTek processor but at the moment, exact specs on the processor are not known. Talking about the camera module of the device, it is expected that Poco M4 will feature a triple rear camera setup consisting of a 64MP OV64B40 sensor, 8MP IMX355 sensor, and a 2MP OV2A lens. The smartphone is expected to operate on Android 11 OS with MIUI 12.5 skin on top. More details on the upcoming device are expected to arrive as the launch date nears and as of now, these are the only expected specifications for Poco M4.

As mentioned above, Poco M4 will relace Poco M3 launched last year. To recall the specifications of the latter, the smartphone came with a 6.53-inch FHD+ display with a waterdrop notch and a standard 60Hz refresh rate. Poco M3 featured a Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 SoC under the hood paired up with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The device had a triple rear camera setup as well headlined by a 48MP camera along with a 2MP depth sensor for portrait shots, and a 2MP macro lens for close-up shots. The device also featured an 8MP selfie shooter at the front.","{'uri': 'telecomtalk.info', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TelecomTalk'}","[{'uri': 'anupam_sharma@telecomtalk.info', 'name': 'Anupam Sharma', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://telecomtalk.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/poco-m4-tipped-to-arrive-in-february-1024x683.jpg,0.05882352941176472,eng-7380541,False,0.8235294222831726,0.05882352941176472,378911340,1

Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) are very different companies, but they'll both profit from the long-term growth of the 5G market, which could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 30% through 2026, according to Research and Markets.

Qualcomm is one of the world's largest mobile chipmakers. Its Snapdragon system on chips (SoCs) bundle together CPUs, GPUs, and 5G baseband modems for smartphones and other devices. Its massive portfolio of wireless patents also grants it a cut of each smartphone sold worldwide.

Nokia is one of the world's largest suppliers of telecommunications equipment. Nokia-branded phones still exist, but the Finnish company no longer produces them -- it merely licenses its brand to HMD Global, a separate company that designs, manufactures, markets, and sells the devices.

Qualcomm and Nokia were both resilient investments in 2021. Qualcomm's stock rose about 20% as it benefited from the surging demand for new 5G chips, while Nokia's stock rallied roughly 60% as a new CEO stabilized its wobbly business. Which of these 5G plays will generate bigger returns in 2022?

Qualcomm and Nokia both struggled in their respective markets before executing their recent turnarounds.

In 2018 and 2019, Qualcomm struggled with sluggish smartphone sales, antitrust probes and fines across the world, smartphone makers revolting against its licensing fees, and its failed attempt to buy NXP to become world's largest automotive chipmaker.

But by the start of 2020, Qualcomm had resolved most of its regulatory challenges and signed new terms with the defiant smartphone makers. New orders for 5G chips rolled in, and its $30 billion buyback plan -- which was launched after the NXP deal collapsed -- boosted its earnings per share (EPS).

As a result, Qualcomm's business stabilized even as the pandemic disrupted supply chains worldwide. In fiscal 2020, its adjusted revenue rose 12% to $21.7 billion -- with its chipmaking and licensing revenues growing 13% and 10%, respectively -- and its adjusted EPS improved 18%.

In fiscal 2021, Qualcomm's adjusted revenue soared 55% to $33.5 billion as it chipmaking and licensing revenues rose 64% and 26%, respectively, and its adjusted earnings soared 104%. New 5G devices, which finally prompted many consumers to upgrade their devices, sparked that growth.

Nokia's problems started after it acquired its rival Alcatel-Lucent in 2016. Instead of investing in new 5G technologies, Nokia spent too much time trying to cut costs while integrating Alcatel-Lucent's massive business. The escalating trade war also caused Nokia to lose lucrative contracts in China to its Chinese rivals Huawei and ZTE.

Nokia suspended its dividend in 2019 to free up more cash for its 5G expansion, but it had already fallen behind its Swedish rival Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) in that race. Instead of launching a bold turnaround plan to close that gap, Nokia's CEO Rajeev Suri abruptly resigned in early 2020 and handed the reins over to Pekka Lundmark.

Nokia's revenue declined 6% to 21.9 billion euros ($24.7 billion) in 2020 as its Chinese revenue plummeted and it lost 5G contracts to Ericsson and other competitors. However, its adjusted EPS still improved 18% as it exercised tighter cost controls throughout the pandemic.

But in the first nine months of 2021, Nokia's revenue rose 3% year over year to 15.8 billion euros ($17.9 billion) as its adjusted EPS grew 118%. It attributed that growth to the stabilization of its 5G business, which has secured 207 commercial 5G deals to date and runs 72 live 5G operator networks, and improvements to its cloud and networks business. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 3% and 38%, respectively, this year.

Qualcomm and Nokia are both expected to generate slower growth in 2022 as the initial round of 5G upgrades cools off.

Analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and earnings to grow 18% and 25%, respectively, this year -- but those are still impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 17 times forward earnings.

Analysts expect Nokia's revenue and earnings to both increase by about 3% next year. Those growth rates seem tepid, but they indicate its business is gradually stabilizing and it won't be crushed by Ericsson or Huawei anytime soon. Its stock also looks fairly cheap at 15 times forward earnings.

Qualcomm also pays a decent forward dividend yield of 1.5%. Nokia still hasn't reinstated its dividend yet.

Nokia outperformed Qualcomm over the past year, but that's mainly because the stock had plummeted to a multi-year low in early 2020.

If we directly compare these two companies, Qualcomm is still clearly a better 5G stock than Nokia, for four reasons: Its core business is healthier, it's growing at a much faster rate but only trades at a slightly higher valuation, it doesn't face as many direct competitors, and it still pays a decent dividend.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'leo_sun@fool.com', 'name': 'Leo Sun', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659487/gettyimages-616898108.jpg,0.1450980392156862,,False,0,0.1450980392156862,378910920,9

An imminent India launch was shrouded in mystery, with many speculating a December release, though that never came to fruition. Now, the India-based Twitter account has officially confirmed the products' launch via teaser videos. Currently, there is no mention of a release window.

The OnePlus 9RT is expected to feature a 6.62-inch full HD+ AMOLED display (1080 x 2400), offering a 120Hz variable refresh rate. It is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset and is paired with up to 12GBs of RAM. The panel also houses an optical in-display fingerprint scanner and comes with Gorilla Glass protection.

The smartphone sports a rear triple-camera setup consisting of a 50MP primary sensor, a 16MP ultra-wide lens, and a 2MP macro camera. At the top-left corner of the screen, you get a 16MP camera for selfies and video calling. The device is backed by a 4500mAh battery with support for 65W fast charging.

In contrast to the standard OnePlus Buds Z, the Z2 introduces ANC (active noise cancellation) for cancelling unwanted external noises by up to 40dB. The buds have been launched in two variants - white and black, and features similar 11mm dynamic drivers as seen in the OnePlus Buds Pro.

Each earbud on the OnePlus Buds Z2 has a 40mAh battery, while the charging case houses a 520mAh one, offering a total of 38 hours of battery life and up to 7 hours of playtime on a single charge. It also has support for Flash Charging, where you can get up to 5 hours of uninterrupted listening at 10 minutes of charging.

The buds also feature a three microphone configuration for better audio reception and feature ultra-low latency of 94ms.

While we wait for the official confirmation, rumours suggest that the company will only launch the OnePlus 10 Pro in January. The vanilla model will launch sometime later this year. OnePlus is yet to confirm the rumour. Meanwhile, MySmartPrice has exclusively learned that the Oppo sub-brand is working on a smartphone with a MediaTek Dimensity 9000 SoC. As per our source Yogesh Brar, this device could well be the OnePlus 10.

MediaTek unveiled the Dimensity 9000 SoC late last year. It said that devices with the new flagship processor will debut starting February. The chipset comes with a 1+3+4 cluster and is based on a 4nm process. It has a peak clock speed of 3.0GHz with three performance cores clocked at 2.85GHz and four efficiency cores clocked at 1.79GHz. The upcoming vanilla OnePlus 10 could get the MediaTek processor while the Pro model will feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC.

OnePlus has not confirmed any details regarding the vanilla model at the moment. If the latest rumours are to be believed, the standard OnePlus 10 will get a launch date sometime around mid-2022. The device could replace the OnePlus 10R, which is unlikely to get a refresh this year due to the OnePlus 9RT launching later this month in India.

The tipster further tells us that OnePlus will soon start testing the devices with its new unified OS with Oppo for the global markets.

We have entered a new year and soon, the smartphone market will be flooded with several new options. It's no surprise that the first week itself will see at least two new mid-premium smartphones in India - Vivo V23 Pro and Xiaomi 11i HyperCharge. The Vivo phone is launching on January 5 while Xiaomi will unveil its first smartphone of the year the very next day. Both these smartphones are likely to be priced around Rs 30,000. So, this is probably the best time to re-visit the best options available in the market right now.

Xiaomi's Mi 11X was one of the best smartphones to launch under Rs 30,000 last year and remains to be one of our top recommendations in January 2022. Similarly, OnePlus Nord 2 is a great all-rounder at this price, offering something in nearly all departments. Other smartphones in this price category also come with good, high-refresh displays, decent cameras and fast charging tech.

Most of these smartphones also support 5G connectivity now. In case you are planning to upgrade the phone, here are the best smartphones under Rs 30,000 in India right now.

Mi 11X

body>

One of the most anticipated Apple products of 2022 is the second-generation AirPods Pro, which is expected to bring a new design to the iconic high-end earbuds. But a new report by Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac) claims that Apple might have an even more exciting trick up its sleeve.

Kuo says Apple's next-generation AirPods, which are due to arrive in the fourth quarter of 2022, will add support for the Apple Lossless (ALAC) format in Apple Music that began rolling out in June, making them the first pair of AirPods and one of the only true wireless earbuds to support the higher-quality format. Apple previously brought lossless support to the HomePod with the launch of iOS 15.1 but has been unable to deliver lossless for AirPods due to the bandwidth limitations of Bluetooth.

Delivering lossless audio to the AirPods Pro would require technology able to increase the available bandwidth for streaming. Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive, which was announced in September, stitches together two proprietary technologies to increase the data throughput required to handle lossless' 44.1kHz, 1,411 kbps bitrate:

To help deliver CD lossless audio quality reliably over Bluetooth wireless technology, aptX Adaptive works in conjunction with Qualcomm Bluetooth High Speed Link technology to help deliver the required sustainable data throughput. Designed to work seamlessly together, these technologies deliver rates beyond 1Mbit/s yet smoothly scale down to 140kbits/s in congested RF environments to minimize any audio dropouts or glitches for a consistent and reliable listening experience.

Apple will likely do something similar for the AirPods Pro. In an interview with What Hi-Fi, VP of Acoustics Gary Geaves said there's a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth.

Bringing lossless audio to the AirPods Pro would be one more reason to buy a pair over the cheaper third-gen AirPods, along with noise cancellation and Conversation Boost.

Both companies have their current P/S multiples around 6x, while TMO's current P/EBIT stands marginally higher at 23x. Do these valuations make sense? We don't think so, and we believe TMO should be valued higher. While both companies have seen a strong rise in revenues since the lockdowns started being lifted, TMO has seen much more rapid and consistent sales growth over the past five fiscal years than Qualcomm. TMO's revenues have risen from $18.3 billion in FY '16 to $32.2 billion in FY '20 and currently stand at a strong $39.1 billion on an LTM basis. In comparison, Qualcomm's sales hovered around the $23 billion mark between FY '16 and FY '20, before surging to $33 billion in FY '21 (Qualcomm's fiscal year ends in September).

Having said that, we dive deeper into the comparison, which makes Thermo Fisher Scientific a better bet than Qualcomm, even at these valuations. Let's step back to look at the fuller picture of the relative valuation of the two companies by looking at detailed historical revenue growth as well as operating income and operating margin growth, along with the financial position. Our dashboard Qualcomm vs Thermo Fisher Scientific: Similar Income, But Thermo Fisher Scientific Is A Better Bet has more details on this. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.

1. Thermo Fisher Scientific Ahead On Revenue Growth

Both companies managed to see strong sales growth post the pandemic, but TMO has witnessed much faster and more consistent revenue growth over the years. TMO's sales have jumped from $18.3 billion in FY '16 to $39.1 billion on an LTM basis, while Qualcomm's revenues have risen from $23.6 billion in FY '16 to around $33 billion on an LTM basis.

Further, TMO's pre-Covid annual sales growth stands at 11.2%, higher than Qualcomm's 1.4%, and even growth during Covid stands at 26.1%, higher than Qualcomm's -3.1%. However, for the most recent quarter, Qualcomm saw more than 60% sales growth YoY, much more than TMO's 9.5%. Even on an LTM basis, Qualcomm's sales growth stands at 62.9%, more than TMO's 37.1%.

Having said that, TMO's sales growth over the years has been much more consistent compared to Qualcomm, and we believe this should be rewarded in the form of a higher valuation for TMO.

2. Qualcomm Ahead On EBIT Margins, But Thermo Fisher Scientific In A Better Cash Position

Qualcomm's P/EBIT ratio stands at around 22x currently, marginally lower than TMO's 23x. This is a little harsh since Qualcomm's LTM EBIT margins stand at 31.7%, higher than TMO's 27%. Further, in terms of recent margin growth, Qualcomm stands ahead, with LTM vs last three FY margin change at 11.4%, more than TMO's 7.8%.

Now, looking at both companies' cash position, TMO's debt as a % of equity stands at 0%, vs Qualcomm's 1%. However, TMO's cash as a % of assets stands much higher at 33.3%, compared to Qualcomm's 16.3%.

3. Finally, Thermo Fisher Scientific Is Ahead In Terms Of Expected Returns

Using P/S as a base, due to high fluctuations in P/E and P/EBIT, we believe TMO is the better choice. TMO's LTM revenues of $39 billion are expected to rise at a CAGR of 11.3% as per our estimates, taking revenue numbers three years out to as high as $54 billion. Assuming TMO's P/S ratio to pull back to an average of about 5.6x, this means that the market cap would rise to $302 billion, an upside of 19% over three years.

In comparison, given historical trends, we expect Qualcomm's sales to rise slower at a CAGR of just 1.6%, taking revenue in three years to a little over $34 billion. However, considering the P/S for Qualcomm to correct to historical averages of around 5x, we estimate a market cap of $175 billion for QCOM, much lower than the level it is at today.

The Net of It All

TMO's revenues are larger than that of Qualcomm's, and the former has also seen faster and more consistent revenue growth over the years, combined with strong EBIT margins and a better cash position. Additionally, our comparison of the post-Covid recovery above, shows that TMO has seen steadier growth than Qualcomm. Due to this, we believe that TMO deserves a higher P/S and P/EBIT multiple compared to Qualcomm, and we believe that this will reflect in the companies' relative valuations soon. As such, we believe that Thermo Fisher Scientific stock is currently a better bet compared to Qualcomm stock.

Over the past few years, the earbud market has expanded significantly, with a lot of the top technology brands all serving up their own take on the hardware. While a lot of these devices come with a premium price tag, there are cheaper alternatives, alternatives that deliver a device with top-notch qualities without requiring you to shell out a bigger sum of cash. This is precisely what Tronsmart has brought to the table with its Onyx Prime Dual-Driver Wireless Earbuds, a gadget that presents quality and ease of use, albeit with quite a basic appearance. I've been testing these earbuds for a little while now and have some thoughts about them and whether or not you should be looking to grab a pair.

Coming as part of a neatly packaged and folding box, the Onyx Prime comes as part of a parcel that also includes a manual, various different sized silicone tips and pieces, and a USB 2.0 to USB-C charging cable. There's not a whole to really delve into here, aside from the fact that the silicone pieces come in four different sizes so that you choose the perfect one to fit the shape and size of your ears, which is always a plus.

As for the actual Onyx Prime system, this is split into three parts: the case, the left earbud and the right earbud. The case is a pretty typical size for wireless earbuds, measuring 70mm by 48.3mm by 30.4mm, and comes in a rounded off rectangular shape in purely black, bar a tiny LED light that graces the rear of the case just above the charging port, and serves as a charging and battery indicator. When you flip open the lid, which seems to be marginally magnetised to ensure a secure fit, you'll find that both earbuds take up the majority of the body, except for where they rest over the bottom centre of the case, where the charging cable connects.

As for each earbud, alike the case, these come in pure black as well, except for having a grey Tronsmart logo on its side, and a LED light just below that flashes when you use the various touch commands it offers. In terms of their appearance, there's really not a lot to say. These are around 35mm long and 15mm wide, and aside from the minimalist and blocky design, the only other part that stands out is the arching silicone piece that fits just a little behind the actual silicone tip, with the purpose to better fit the shape of your ears and hold the earbud in place more firmly. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the look this silicone piece gives the earbud, but considering removing them leaves an indented space on the earbud, I found it better to leave them on.

While they aren't the most eye-catching or exciting looking earbuds, the Onyx Prime does make up for this by delivering clear and high-quality audio, regardless of whether you're listening to chaotic rock or bassy electronic music, or even simply just streaming a movie or playing a game. These earbuds display a broad and deep audio range, and this remains true even when you crank the volume up significantly, which is a situation where a lot of earbuds commonly begin to show distortion and a drop in quality.

The reason why this isn't the case with the Onyx Prime is down to the Qualcomm QCC3040 chip and the hybrid Dual-Driver technology that combine to create a device with a wider frequency range capable of delivering a greater and clearer audio profile. Match this up with Bluetooth 5.2 technology and Tronsmart's TrueWireless systems, and you get audio and a device that is both clear and defined, but also lag-free and capable of serving this up even at ranges that are over 10m away from your actual phone or whatever you are connected to.

In terms of the fit of the actual earbuds, I've found this to be a little all over the place. Even after switching out the various silicone extra parts, my right earbud fits comfortably and firmly and with a solid seal, which helps serve up a better listening experience, but my left earbud, despite a lot of trial and error, always seems to lack the same seal, making for a fit that often feels like its about to fall out - even though it never actually does. I haven't ruled out my ears being the problem here, but considering this is an issue I've not encountered with other earbuds, it seems to be related to the Onyx Prime first and foremost.

As for how the earbuds feel while wearing, they are light and barely noticeable, and thanks to the use of silicone tips, you don't get the same level of lack of comfort after hours of use, as first generation Airpods often served up, as an example.

Building on using the Onyx Prime for hours, from my experience with these earbuds, I can add that you'll never really have an issue with battery or charge. The buds are expected to last for seven hours on a single charge, with the case and its extra charge adding an extra 33 hours to that total, assuming you are playing music at around 50% volume for that duration. If you prefer a louder listening experience, like me, you'll still get plenty out of this system, but it won't be the promised full 40 hours, before needing to charge it back - which only takes a couple of hours to fully do so as well.

As a final couple of points, I'd like to mention just how easy the Onyx Prime is to set up and connect to your device, and how the touch controls work. Connecting simply requires you to lift the lid on the case with the buds inside, and then selecting the Onyx Prime from your phone/tablet's Bluetooth available connection list and then you're off. It's really that simple.

Looking at the touch controls, these are pretty basic and allow you to skip songs, adjust volume, answer calls, power on/off, and more. The idea is to tap where the logo is on the side of the earbuds, and for the most part, this works effectively and fluidly. It's not perfect and there are times where you'll be doing an action a couple of times before it clocks it, or rather you'll try doing one thing and it'll do something else instead, but this seems to be fairly typical for earbud touch controls in general, in my experience.

All In all though, considering the Onyx Prime is quite a cheap set of earbuds, retailing for around £45-55, there's not a lot to dislike about them. The audio is surprisingly clear and high-quality for a system on the cheaper side of the spectrum, and the ease of use and connectivity only serves to elevate the experience. Granted, they don't really have the most eye-catching or exciting appearance, but that's hardly a reason to not grab a pair if you're looking for some capable earbuds for a reasonable price, as the Onyx Prime ticks all of those boxes.","{'uri': 'gamereactor.eu', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'GameReactor'}","[{'uri': 'ben_lyons@gamereactor.eu', 'name': 'Ben Lyons', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.gamereactor.eu/media/28/tronsmartonyxprime_3682863b.jpg,0.3098039215686275,eng-7384458,False,0.5764706134796143,0.3098039215686275,378905040,1

RBI has shown its ability to execute on such challenges with its recent turnarounds at Tim Hortons and Burger King, its two biggest brands. Their same-store sales growth in the latest quarter jumped 8.9 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively.

Tim Hortons is ""tripling down"" on espresso, a growth opportunity it acknowledges having long neglected. It is also upgrading its lunch and dinner offerings. They currently amount to only 35 per cent of Tim Horton's sales, in a segment that accounts for 60 per cent of the fast-food industry.

RBI's November acquisition of Florida-based Firehouse Restaurant Group Inc. for $1 billion (U.S.) gives RBI further growth potential. With forecast 2021 sales of $1.1 billion (U.S.), the fast-growing Firehouse Subs chain, with about 1,200 stores, still has only a fraction of the estimated $30 billion (U.S.) fast-food sandwich market.

RBI stock is trading about 40 per cent below its 2019 peak of about $75 (Cdn.). And the shares boast a handsome dividend yield of 3.6 per cent.

What makes RBI interesting as a long-term investment is its industry-leading tech platform, to which new stores and entire chains can be added with relative ease.

And RBI benefits from one of the industry's biggest franchisee networks. RBI is counting on its franchisees to expand the Firehouse brand in Canada, where it now has just 50 locations; and the Tim Hortons brand in China, where RBI is planning for hundreds of new stores.

Rogers Communications Inc. The high-profile dispute over control of Rogers last fall obscures the company's underlying strengths. So do pandemic economics.

As Canada's largest wireless provider, Toronto-based Rogers has taken a bigger hit than rivals BCE Inc. and Telus Corp. in sharply reduced roaming charges. Those are the fees that wireless customers pay when using their devices abroad.

That, of course, is part of the upside story at Rogers. At this writing, all bets are off on the impact of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. But travel restrictions will eventually be lifted, and pre-pandemic levels of roaming revenues will be restored.

The big bet for Rogers' investors is the firm's ability to win regulatory approval for its proposed $26-billion acquisition of rival Shaw Communications Inc., which won't come before the end of the year.

Most analysts expect deal approval, though many believe Shaw's Freedom Mobile unit will have to be excluded to maintain sufficient competition.

With Shaw, Rogers would be able to spread its cost of upgrading to 5G, or fifth-generation wireless, over a bigger customer base. And the combined firm would have greater marketing heft in luring subscribers away from Bell and Telus.

Rogers outpaced Bell and Telus in pre-pandemic profit growth, more than doubling profit in the four years to 2019.

Shares in the company trade 13 per cent below their 2019 peak of about $73. They pay a rich dividend yield of 3.2 per cent. And they're the cheapest of the Big Three telecoms, trading at a multiple of 20 times earnings. The p/e's for BCE and Telus are 21.2 and 30.8, respectively.

Enbridge Inc. Enbridge is a reliable income stock. Its 6.7 per cent dividend is one of the richest in Corporate Canada. But Enbridge also has growth prospects unusual for utilities.

The Calgary-based company operates the world's longest network of oil and gas pipelines, with more than 28,000 kilometres of pipe in active use.

A return to normal rates of North American fuel consumption alone should restore Enbridge's sales to their 2019 level, a 40 per cent increase over 2020.

Because of its sprawling pipeline network across North America, Enbridge is ideally suited to continually purchasing still more pipelines for integration into its network.

That advantage helped Enbridge more than double its profits in the four pre-pandemic years ending in 2019.

And as one of Canada's largest renewable energy firms, Enbridge is also an investor hedge against the expected gradual decline in fossil fuel use and the ascendancy of alternative energy sources.

Enbridge operates or has large equity stakes in 23 wind farms and 11 solar energy operations in Canada, the U.S., and Europe. Combined, Enbridge's share of these projects generates 2.1 megawatts (MW) of electricity, equivalent to the power demands of about 945,000 homes.

The firm's renewable energy portfolio also includes a hydroelectric power plant, a geothermal project, and several waste heat recovery facilities.

Enbridge has so far invested more than $7 billion in renewable energy projects. Enbridge has the cash flow to further increase its renewable energy commitment as the North American energy mix changes.

In the meantime, the stock trades at a reasonable multiple of 17.5 times earnings. At a current price of $48, its shares are 21 per cent below Enbridge's 2017 peak price of about $61.05.

Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. CP's proposed $34.6 -billion merger with Kansas City Southern, formalized in September, would enable CP to apply its best-in-class operating efficiencies across a much larger customer base.

CP expects that the rechristened CPKC, which would remain headquartered in Calgary, would be more competitive in wooing shippers away from less fuel-efficient truck transport, the chief rival to rail.

And CPKC would provide shippers with access to Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf of Mexico ports unmatched by its five Class 1 railway peers in North America.

The combination would boost CP revenues by more than 40 per cent, to about $11 billion. And it would expand CP's rail network by about 25 per cent, to more than 32,000 km. of track.

The proposed CPKC would be the only Class 1 railway with an extensive rail network in Mexico.

The short-term issue hanging over the stock is whether that transformational deal will win approval from a U.S. rail regulator that more than once has rejected Canada-U.S. rail mergers.

But odds are that Mexican regulatory approval for the deal in November foreshadows a favourable decision by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB). The proposed merger has been painstakingly structured to earn the STB's approval in a decision expected next spring.

In the meantime, CP has been an outstanding performer, with profits that have increased by 50 per cent in the past five years. CP stock value has room to grow, having recovered by more than 72 per cent from its 2020 low, but less than the 94 per cent average for its Class 1 peers. CP shares are also the lowest priced among that group, trading at just 19 times earnings.

Magna International Inc. Magna expects that its heavy investment in electric vehicles (EVs) will pay off in a total revenue increase of at least 25 per cent by 2023, to about $55 billion in annual sales.

In aggressively bulking up its EV capability, Magna is partnering with global firms including South Korean components maker LG Electronics Inc., Israeli EV tech start-up REE Automotive, and California EV designer Fisker Inc.

As one of the world's few contract automakers, Magna, based in Aurora, Ont., will build the first line of all-electric Fisker Ocean SUVs at its Austrian assembly plant starting in November 2022.

Global rivalry to snap up specialized makers of auto equipment is intense. In October, Magna was outbid for Veoneer Inc., a Swedish company focused on auto safety tech.

That Magna had $4.9 billion to finance that purchase speaks to the strength of its balance sheet. And its refusal to top a 20 per cent higher competing bid by Qualcomm Inc. is a reassurance of Magna's discipline during a buying spree in which both traditional automakers and Silicon Valley firms are bidding up auto-related assets.

Meanwhile, Magna's internal R&D powerhouse and its swelling roster of outside tech alliances enables it to offer its long-standing automaker customers a growing portfolio of EV engines, powertrain systems and safety components.

Magna shares are trading about 19 per below their June peak of $125.24, due to short-term supply chain problems afflicting Magna's customers. The stock is reasonably priced, trading at less than 13 times earnings, and its dividend yield is a respectable 2.1 per cent.","{'uri': 'thestar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Star'}",[],https://images.thestar.com/j3ZulK6FmXYOX9SpLbVYU2pl0-s=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(1641178336673)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/business/opinion/2022/01/03/stocks-to-watch-in-2022/enbridge_pipeline.jpg,0.2627450980392156,,False,0,0.2627450980392156,378904500,1

The company unveiled three models - the standard Xiaomi 12, the premium 12 Pro and the affordable 12X models. Already, these devices are official in China and the global markets including India are awaiting their launch.

While there is no official confirmation regarding the global launch of the Xiaomi 12 series, a report has revealed the possible launch timeline of these models in India. This information was shared by MySmartPrice citing the tipster Mukul Sharma.

As per the claim, the Xiaomi 12 smartphones will be launched outside of China by the end of February or early March. The India launch of these smartphones will follow the global launch, if not at the same time. However, it remains to be seen when exactly the India launch of these smartphones will take place.

Xiaomi 12 bestows a 6.28-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection and a 120Hz refresh rate. Also, it has Dolby Vision support. Under its hood, the Xiaomi 12 uses an octa-core Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC.

It flaunts a triple-camera setup at the rear with a 50MP primary Sony IMX766 sensor with an f/1.88 lens and optical image stabilization (OIS) support. It houses a 13MP secondary ultra-wide lens and a 5MP tertiary macro lens. This camera uses the proprietary CyberFocus technology for an enhanced focus. At the front, there is a 32MP selfie camera sensor with support for Stagger HDR and AI beautification.

Connectivity aspects include 5G, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth v5.2, GPS, NFC, Infrared and a USB Type-C port. Xiaomi 12 features Dolby Atmos support, Harman Kardon-tuned stereo speakers and HiRes audio. A 4500mAh battery with 67W fast charging and 50W wireless charging fuels the device. It has 10W reverse wireless charging as well.

Xiaomi 12 Pro adorns a 6.73-inch WQHD+ E5 AMOLED display with a 120Hz dynamic refresh rate and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection. There is a low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) backplane technology used by Apple on premium iPhones. The processor is the same as seen on the standard variant.

While the connectivity and storage aspects are also the same, the Xiaomi 12 Pro houses a triple-camera setup with three 50MP sensors. It comes with a four-unit speaker system including a dedicated tweeter and Harman Kardon tuning support. A 4600mAh battery fuels the Pro variant with 120W fast wired charging. Also, there is 50W wireless charging and 10W reverse wireless charging support.

The Xiaomi 12X is a modified version of the Xiaomi 12. It comes with the same 6.28-inch display, camera setup and battery. However, it uses an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 SoC.

Besides these smartphones, Xiaomi 12 Ultra is speculated to be on cards and could be unveiled in February. This ultra-premium flagship is yet to be officially confirmed and could see the light of the day after the Chinese Spring festival. The Ultra variant is expected to feature a quad-camera setup with a 50MP primary camera and three 48MP shooters serving as the ultrawide, 3x telephoto zoom and 10X zoom lenses respectively.","{'uri': 'gizbot.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gizbot'}","[{'uri': 'abhinaya_prabhu@gizbot.com', 'name': 'Abhinaya Prabhu', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.gizbot.com/img/2022/01/xiaomi-12-series-global-launch-timeline-tipped-1641208005.jpg?03012022164434,0.08235294117647052,eng-7377557,False,0.7686274647712708,0.08235294117647052,378904440,1

One of the most anticipated Apple products of 2022 is the second-generation AirPods Pro, which is expected to bring a new design to the iconic high-end earbuds. But a new report by Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac) claims that Apple might have an even more exciting trick up its sleeve.

Kuo says Apple's next-generation AirPods, which are due to arrive in the fourth quarter of 2022, will add support for the Apple Lossless (ALAC) format in Apple Music that began rolling out in June, making them the first pair of AirPods and one of the only true wireless earbuds to support the higher-quality format. Apple previously brought lossless support to the HomePod with the launch of iOS 15.1 but has been unable to deliver lossless for AirPods due to the bandwidth limitations of Bluetooth.

Delivering lossless audio to the AirPods Pro would require technology able to increase the available bandwidth for streaming. Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive, which was announced in September, stitches together two proprietary technologies to increase the data throughput required to handle lossless' 44.1kHz, 1,411 kbps bitrate:

""To help deliver CD lossless audio quality reliably over Bluetooth wireless technology, aptX Adaptive works in conjunction with Qualcomm Bluetooth High Speed Link technology to help deliver the required sustainable data throughput. Designed to work seamlessly together, these technologies deliver rates beyond 1Mbit/s yet smoothly scale down to 140kbits/s in congested RF environments to minimize any audio dropouts or glitches for a consistent and reliable listening experience.""

Apple will likely do something similar for the AirPods Pro. In an interview with What Hi-Fi, VP of Acoustics Gary Geaves said ""there's a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth.""

Bringing lossless audio to the AirPods Pro would be one more reason to buy a pair over the cheaper third-gen AirPods, along with noise cancellation and Conversation Boost.","{'uri': 'macworld.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Macworld'}",[],https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/airpods-pro-design.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,0.3176470588235294,eng-7378051,False,0.7019608020782471,0.3176470588235294,378902820,2

New year should not be just about the resolutions that many of you know will abandon in a few days. It should also be about shopping and if you are looking for a gaming phone on budget, you have come to the right place. Now, you have at least four battle royale games, Battlegrounds Mobile India, PUBG: New State, Call of Duty Mobile, and Garena Free Fire, that you can play, but your experience will not be pleasant unless your phone is not good in specifications and features. The good thing is that you do not have to spend a bomb on such a phone.

At India Today Tech, we come across all sorts of smartphones and they belong to different price segments. If you are looking for a gaming phone for under Rs 15,000, you have many options. But we have handpicked only a few ones that we have thoroughly tested. These phones come from different brands but they are all going to give you an enjoyable gaming experience. We have included phones in this list according to their current prices on online shopping websites.

Realme Narzo 50A

Realme's Narzo series of smartphones has mostly been about big specifications at a small price. The company touts that this series is meant for youngsters, who like to play a lot of games. And the Narzo 50A is no exception. The phone has a MediaTek Helio G85 processor, which is good enough to handle modest gaming. It has a 6.5-inch HD+ display, which is a big size, so you will not have issues firing that gun. The Realme Narzo 50A starts at Rs 11,499 and it is available on Flipkart, Amazon, and Realme's online store.

Our verdict: The Realme Narzo 50A is a good phone for its price. And it ticks most of the right boxes. Big display? Check. Good processor? Check. Long-lasting battery? Check. All of that is reasonable enough to make the Narzo 50A a compelling option on the market. And for Rs 11,499, I think it is the right investment.

Motorola Moto G51 5G

Motorola recently expanded its 5G lineup with the addition of G51 5G. This phone takes inspiration from the Motorola Moto G 5G. The best part about this phone is the stock Android software that makes it easy to navigate the interface. The Moto G51 5G comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 Pro processor, which is slightly better than the vanilla version and that means better gaming performance. The Motorola Moto G51 5G sells for Rs 14,999 on Flipkart.

Our verdict: The Moto G51 5G's display is pretty vibrant, the apps also loaded quickly and there weren't any visible lags. The phone comes with near-stock Android, so you won't have to endure bloatware and the annoying notifications from the pre-loaded apps. Overall, the phone has a very clean interface with no unwanted apps.

Redmi Note 10T 5G

The Redmi Note 10T 5G was launched as another variant in the Redmi Note series and its specifications make the phone good enough for gaming. It costs Rs Rs 14,999 for the entry-level model and we liked the phone for what it brings for that price. The Redmi Note 10T 5G comes with a 6.5-inch full-HD+ display with up to a 90Hz refresh rate and a 20:9 aspect ratio, MediaTek Dimensity 700 SoC with up to 6GB RAM, and a 5000mAh battery that will help you have the Chicken Dinner.

Our verdict: It was about time that Xiaomi had added an affordable 5G smartphone to its portfolio, given that most of its devices till Rs 25,000 (except Mi 10i) only support 4G networks, while the competition has shifted its strategy to 5G. The Redmi Note 10T 5G solves that purpose by offering an option under Rs 15,000.

Poco M3 Pro 5G

The Poco M3 Pro 5G is also a phone that we would recommend to gamers who are on a budget. The Poco M3 Pro 5G sports a 6.55-inch Full-HD+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate. It is powered by an octa-core Mediatek Dimesity 700 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. A 48-megapixel triple rear camera setup and an 8-megapixel sensor for selfies are there, too. The Poco M3 Pro 5G is powered by a 5000mAh battery with support for 18W fast charging. The Poco M3 Pro 5G starts at Rs 14,499.

Our verdict: The Poco M3 Pro 5G offers suitable hardware and serves as a decent gaming option on the budget. Plus, the added 5G gives it an edge over its competitors. At a starting price of Rs 14,499, the Poco M3 Pro 5G is a decent purchase for most buyers.","{'uri': 'indiatoday.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'India Today'}","[{'uri': 'shubham_verma@indiatoday.in', 'name': 'Shubham Verma', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202201/realmegtneo2_pubg_16112021-647x363.png?KbPrh3Uz9IP26oSs2jA15J9FqA2v7EiB,-0.0117647058823529,eng-7379785,False,0.4745098054409027,-0.0117647058823529,378902640,1

Foldable phones are still rare to find around us, although they have been there for over a couple of years. But, in India, Samsung gave us the first commercially available foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Fold, in 2019. And, now we have seen some newer versions and more handset manufacturers jumping to this form factor. But, some of the problems that have been there stopping foldable phones from leaving a mark in the smartphone industry are their pricing and practical use.

While the pricing may still take a few more years to come down and be more accessible to consumers in the country, practical use is something that has constantly been improving. Thanks to the likes of Samsung, which is largely the only manufacturer investing heavily on foldable phones globally. The good news is that Samsung is finally getting some company from Oppo, Motorola, Huawei, and a few more brands preparing to introduce new foldable devices into the global market.

2022 could be the year to see wider adoption of foldable phones globally, especially in a market like India, where consumers do get foldable smartphone options. For example, Samsung has been selling the Galaxy Z Fold3 5G and Galaxy Z Flip3 5G since last year. Here's why we believe 2022 could be the year when foldable finally gets some appreciation, mostly commercially.

Samsung could lead from the front

If there's one brand that is likely to see maximum traction in the foldable segment, it has to be Samsung, and one of the obvious reasons is the investment it has made so far in this form factor. Both the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 and Galaxy Z Flip3 have received rave reviews and are great value products if budget isn't a problem and the consumer wants to try a newer form factor. This year, we expect Samsung to launch the Galaxy Z Fold4 and Galaxy Z Flip4 as successors to the existing line-up of devices available in the market.

Talking about the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 first, it features a main screen of 7.6-inches while the cover screen of 6.2-inches offers enough screen space for people who love to use the screen on the go. Powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, the Galaxy Z Fold3 is as powerful as some of the latest Android flagships of 2021. Even in the camera department, the triple camera array featuring three 12-megapixel sensors and selfie cameras on the main and cover screens do not let selfie lovers down. To enhance productivity, the Galaxy Z Fold3 also supports S Pen, and 12GB of RAM offers enough memory to run some of the most demanding apps. Keeping all that running is a 4400mAh battery.

Jumping to the Galaxy Z Flip3, it also offers enough to keep some of the most demanding consumers happy. It features a 6.7-inch main screen while a 1.9-inch cover screen fares well too. The clamshell design has won accolades from reviewers for its usability and manages to play the nostalgia factor nicely.

In 2022, we expect Samsung to continue to set the benchmark for the foldable segment with its newer offerings.

Oppo and others joining the club

Devices like the Oppo Find N are a boon to the foldable segment. Thankfully, we spent some time with the Oppo Find N, which unfortunately isn't launching in India because of the lack of an app ecosystem around foldable devices.

Oppo's Chief Product Officer Pete Lau, during the unveiling, revealed that one big reason why the company chose not to launch the Find N outside China is because of lack of software optimisation and app ecosystem, something that the brand believes it could manage in its homeland. The phone opens up in a landscape mode, which isn't the case with Samsung foldable. What it offers is a more practical design for watching videos, reading e-books, and even playing games. While initially, the 8.4:9 aspect ratio feels unorthodox, as you spend time with it, you realise it is a far better form factor for the foldable segment.

We found it an excellent device in the limited time we spent with the Oppo Find N. It becomes an even better choice when considering the under Rs 1 lakh price. However, it is unfortunate that it didn't make it to India. In 2022, we expect that to change and Oppo to launch the Find N successor in India.

But it's not just Oppo because of which we are excited about. At this point, the rumour mill points to multiple companies working on foldable devices, including Google, Xiaomi, Realme, TCL, and Vivo.

Considering that the foldable segment is still small in sales numbers, the more devices, the merrier it is likely to be.

For the foldable smartphone segment, to woo more consumers, pricing is the key. The Oppo Find N has shown us the way to how it can be achieved. The more aggressive the price foldable gets, the better will be the chances for the device to do well in the markets. The bottom line is that 2022 could be a year when the foldable segment gets some good devices and more consumers adopt them.","{'uri': 'indiatoday.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'India Today'}","[{'uri': 'ketan_pratap@indiatoday.in', 'name': 'Ketan Pratap', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202201/galaxy-z-flip3-647x363.jpeg?8ScO4RbC3eUdNNxXqegPRh5mv0YxnS1U,0.1450980392156862,eng-7377109,False,0.4862745106220245,0.1450980392156862,378902640,1

It's a new year and there's already a fresh Apple rumor hot off the presses: the upcoming AirPods 2 Pro will support lossless audio streaming. According to a note published by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the company is planning a design overhaul of its top-end wireless buds, along with a new case that will beep to help you find it.

The Cupertino-based company launched a lossless music tier for Apple Music last May. But there were only a few ways to enjoy it: if you've got an iPhone, you had to get an external DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) to listen to lossless files; if you've got a Mac or a MacBook, you could technically use a high-end pair of wired headphones to enjoy high-fidelity music.

However, the surprising bit was that none of the AirPods models -- including the $550 AirPods Max -- didn't support lossless audio streaming out of the box. That seemed like an odd choice from Apple. Thankfully, the rumored AirPods Pro 2 could be an answer to that.

While I want to jump with joy, I am keeping my feet firmly on the ground for the time being. Until the new AirPods Pro are out, we would have no idea how they'll improve the audio with Bluetooth's current limitations.

Gary Geaves, Apple's VP of Acoustics, told What Hi-Fi in an interview last week about the wireless standard's bottleneck for audio delivery:

Things like the amount of latency you get when you move your head, and if that's too long, between you moving your head and the sound changing or remaining static, it will make you feel quite ill, so we have to concentrate very hard on squeezing the most that we can out of the Bluetooth technology, and there's a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth.

But it's fair to say that we would like more bandwidth and... I'll stop right there. We would like more bandwidth.

It would be interesting to see if Apple's solution could be applied to a wider range of wireless audio solutions. Currently, there are some standards such as Qualcomm's AptX and Sony LDAC -- which can transmit audio at a bitrate of 990kbps. You can learn more about bitrate here.

Apple's challenge would be to surpass that and provide the industry best wireless audio experience. If the company manages to do that, it might push other stakeholders, including the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, which manages the standard, to update our beloved Bluetooth wireless spec for better sound.

In the end, the lossless audio support feature might not make a huge difference in the audio quality of the AirPods Pro 2. But it'll hopefully make wireless audio less shitty.","{'uri': 'thenextweb.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Next Web'}","[{'uri': 'ivan_mehta@thenextweb.com', 'name': 'Ivan Mehta', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2022%2F01%2FAirPods-Lossless.jpg&signature=ecfaa7935abd5b2463dc9905f60914bd,0.3411764705882352,eng-7378051,False,0.572549045085907,0.3411764705882352,378902400,1

Just check Vivo Y21T price in India,"Vivo Y21T price is Rs. 16,000 on launch. The phone packs the Snapdragon 680 processor and triple rear camera.

The Vivo Y21T smartphone has been officially launched by Vivo, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer in India days after its debut in Indonesia. The company's Y-series smartphone features a waterdrop-style display notch, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 680 processor, and a triple-rear camera setup with a 50 megapixel primary camera. Vivo Y21T is available in two colours options -- Pearl White and Midnight Blue. Vivo Y21T price has been pegged at around Rs. 16,000. It is available with only one storage configuration with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage.

While both the Indonesian and Indian versions have the same name, the two have minor differences. The most important distinction is the display, which is a 6.51-inch LCD panel with a resolution of 1600 x 720 pixels and a 60Hz refresh rate in the Indonesian version, while the newly launched in India has a larger 6.58-inch FHD+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 96 percent NTSC colour gamut.

Vivo Y21T has a triple camera setup that has a 50 megapixel primary sensor, a 2 megapixel Bokeh camera, and a 2 megapixel Macro lens at the back. For selfies and video calls, there is a 8 megapixel camera on the front. The smartphone is backed by a 5,000mAh battery with 18W fast charging capabilities. As previously stated, the Vivo Y21T is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 SoC, 128GB of internal storage that can be increased to 1TB, and 4GB of RAM with 1GB of virtual memory expansion. A side-mounted fingerprint sensor, FunTouch OS 12 based on Android 11, and liquid cooling technology, USB-C, 3.5mm headphone jack, a dual SIM slot are among the other features.

Talking about its looks and design, the smartphone comes with a 2.5D flat frame and 8mm thin body, which weighs around 182 grams. At the back, you will see the pearl lustre with a hint of pink for Pearl White model whereas the Midnight Blue colour comes in a sophisticated frosted surface with a subtle shine allowing the deep shade of blue to overpower the look at the back.

The price of Vivo Y21T for India isn't announced yet. But keeping in mind the price of the model in Indonesia, Y21T which is price at IDR 3,099,000 is expected to be available around Rs. 16,000 in India.","{'uri': 'tech.hindustantimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Hindustan Times Tech'}",[],https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2022/01/03/1600x900/Vivo_Y21T_1641205452619_1641205485149.png,0.0117647058823529,eng-7377391,False,0.7568627595901489,0.0117647058823529,378901980,2

Samsung seems to be all set to take the wraps off its next-generation Exynos processor, which will include an AMD-powered GPU; the South Korean tech giant has announced that its Exynos 2100 successor will see the light of day next week.

In a tweet, Samsung confirmed that it will hold an event on January 11 for the unveiling of its next Exynos chip featuring a new GPU based on AMD's RDNA 2. For the uninitiated, the RDNA 2 graphics architecture is the same GPU used in the Xbox Series X, Sony PlayStation 5, and AMD's Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards.

AMD announced earlier last year that it would bring the RDNA2 architecture to the mobile segment. However, the chipset isn't expected to deliver the same level of graphics performance to Samsung's future phones that it does to some of the best video game consoles. Nonetheless, Samsung promised improved gaming performance with the upcoming processor, which will bring ray tracing and variable rate shading to mobile devices.

The incorporation of AMD graphics into the Exynos processor is not surprising. In 2019, Samsung announced a collaboration with the semiconductor company to use Radeon graphics in its mobile processors.

The teaser didn't specifically mention the Exynos 2200 moniker, but that's what the next-generation SoC will most likely be called. It's also expected to power Samsung's best Android phones in 2022, such as the upcoming Galaxy S22 series, though this SoC is likely to be limited to global versions of the phone, with US models presumably using Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset.

It's worth noting that this is the first Exynos chipset to include an AMD-powered GPU, indicating that Samsung intends to compete with Qualcomm's Snapdragon and Apple's mobile chipsets.","{'uri': 'androidcentral.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Android Central'}",[],https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/02/samsung-logo-ces-2019.jpg,0.1215686274509804,eng-7378249,False,0.8470588326454163,0.1215686274509804,378901560,2

It's a daring decision by the Consumer Technology Association, the industry trade group that sponsored the annual extravaganza -- one that runs the risk of creating a superspreader event. CTA President Gary Shapiro contends the company has taken every possible safety precaution, requiring vaccinations and masks, and handing out self-test kits to all attendees. CES was held in an all-virtual format in January 2021

Many larger companies have withdrawn from in-person participation in the show. T-Mobile US (ticker: TMUS ) CEO Mike Sievert canceled a planned keynote, and General Motors ( GM ) CEO Mary Barra will deliver her keynote virtually. Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Mercedes, Meta ( FB ), Procter & Gamble (PG), Lenovo, Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ), and many others have decided not to participate in person. Many news outlets have also opted out of live coverage, including tech publications such as CNET, Engadget, and the Verge. But despite many predictions to the contrary, CTA declined to cancel CES.

""CES will and must go on,"" Shapiro wrote . ""It will have many more small companies than large ones. It may have big gaps on the show floor. Certainly, it will be different from previous years. It may be messy. But innovation is messy. It is risky and uncomfortable. I view CES as representing the best of our unique American history -- a place where those who are different and have big ideas can gather. Where success is not based on class or religion or anything but the strength of an idea.""

Shapiro added that canceling the show would ""hurt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators who have made investments in building their exhibits and are counting on CES for their business, inspiration and future.""

Key themes at this year's event will include autonomous and electric vehicles, health and wellness products and the development of the metaverse. Keynote speakers will include Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) CEO Robert Ford and Samsung Electronics CEO Jong-Hee Han, in addition to GM's Barra. Peloton Interactive (PTON) CEO John Foley will speak at the CTA's annual ""Leaders in Technology"" dinner.

But the biggest story at CES 2022 undoubtedly will be how event organizers, exhibitors, and attendees cope with Covid. Focus will be on the effectiveness of CTA's safety protocols, the smaller crowds, and personal choices on whether to attend the event at all.

The CES show floor will be open for three days, down from the usual four, starting on Wednesday -- on Friday, CTA announced that it was reducing this year's event by a day. ""The step was taken as an additional safety measure to the current health protocols that have been put in place for CES,"" CTA said. A few companies have been shifted to virtual press events -- including Bosch, Hisense, and Intel (INTC).

This year's event will include the CES debut of a new section of the Las Vegas Convention Center, the West Hall; CES won't be using the Old South Hall of the LVCC. One way to get around will be via built by Elon Musk's Boring Co. that ferries passengers via Tesla ( TSLA ) vehicles. Exhibition space in The Venetian will again host another group of exhibitors, while press day events will take place at the Mandalay Bay convention center.

Barron's plans to provide updates from the event throughout the week.

With the start of the new year, the annual cycle of smartphone launches will repeat itself. For the house of Asus, this will mean a new top-of-the-line smartphone named Asus Zenfone 9, as well as a flagship phone under its gaming division Republic of Gamers. New leaks on the internet now give us our first-ever preview of the two Asus phones.

A new report claims to show leaked designs of both Asus Zenfone 9 and the ROG Phone 6, as the new ROG flagship phone will likely be called. The leaked images come in the form of 2D sketches and depict all of the components of both smartphones in detail. A look at the sketches and it is easy to figure that these might indeed be the next big phones from Asus.

First spotted by GizChina, the report comes from Equal Leaks and claims that both the Zenfone 9 and the ROG Phone 6 series devices will be powered by Qualcomm's recent Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor. As for the details on the former, the Zenfone 9 may do away with Asus' iconic flip camera design, and instead, go for a secondary display at the back.

Asus Zenfone 9

So what will this mean for the new Asus flagship? This means that the Zenfone 9 will not have a selfie shooter on its display, and instead, go for a completely immersive screen. Selfies will then be taken care of by the Zenfone 9's main camera setup at the back. So to take a selfie, just rotate the phone, point the camera towards you, see how the photo is turning out through the secondary display, and click away.

This will be a stark shift from Asus' flip cameras, which are meant to be an alternative to the selfie camera setup. The back panel will reportedly have functions other than the secondary display too. Equal Leaks mentions that the Zenfone 9 will come with a touch sensor at the back for added functionalities, like taking screenshots, photos and opening or closing a flashlight.

Asus ROG Phone 6

Just as in 2021, Asus will likely launch two models under its ROG Phone 6 lineup. These might include the vanilla model, along with ROG Phone 6 Pro. The new report shares that the phones will have a largely similar design to their ROG Phone 5 series counterparts.

Asus ROG Phone 6 may feature the same triple-lens camera setup as the Phone 5. The placement of the lenses and the LED flash within this, however, will likely be different. The sketches show the horizontal module housing all three lenses as well as the LED flash.

The design on the back panel is also different than before, and both the phones will differ in their looks based on this. They will, however, feature a vertical display stick at the back for notifications and other imagery.

Since these are the first of their kind leaks, not much information about the phones is available so far. Though looking at these, we can expect to see some really attractive phones in 2022 from the house of Asus.","{'uri': 'indiatoday.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'India Today'}","[{'uri': 'sarthak_dogra@indiatoday.in', 'name': 'Sarthak Dogra', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202201/ROG_Phone_6-647x363.jpeg?Op3B27DFWtFb6Uoiy8y4BhNyLH8MKCEs,0.03529411764705892,eng-7379245,False,0.8196078538894653,0.03529411764705892,378899700,1

The Chinese tech giant has seen sales tumble as the Biden administration maintained sanctions that were levied under President Donald Trump. The blacklisting cut off Huawei's access to American-made components and technology vital for its once red-hot mobile phone business, while several US allies have also barred the use of the Chinese firm's equipment in building their 5G networks.

With sanctions set to persist, Huawei will focus on ICT infrastructure to help different industries go digital and smart devices, according to the New Year message. It will increase investment in HarmonyOS and EulerOS, its operating systems for consumer and enterprise, while boosting spending in technology to develop clean energy and help traditional energy sectors go digital.

""The harder you strike flint, the brighter the spark,"" rotating chairman Guo Ping said in the letter. ""The road ahead is long and hard. As long as we press ahead, we will reach our destination.""

While sales fell by double digits yet again, the pace of shrinkage slowed and revenue was actually up 32% from the September quarter. The company released several major phones over the past few months, and since early this year has accelerated a drive into less traditional sources of income from mining to agriculture to offset losses elsewhere.

Huawei, a closely held firm, didn't released detailed financial information for its various business units. Years of US sanctions have strained Huawei's smartphone business, which was once the biggest source of revenue before a series of Trump-era trade bans cut the company off from key chipsets made by an array of suppliers from Qualcomm to Skyworks Solutions.

Huawei has been exploring ways to sustain a business that brought in C¥‎483-billion (US$4.2 billion) of revenue last year. That includes licensing its handset designs to third parties as a way to gain access to critical components. The company is also exploring emerging opportunities in areas from smart mining to electric vehicles.

In his New Year message, Guo reiterated that Huawei will continue providing partners with incentives and support. The company also said it will ""proactively"" support and develop high-quality suppliers globally, as part of efforts to overcome the US blacklisting.","{'uri': 'newsghana.com.gh', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'News Ghana'}",[],https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Huawei_turns_to_driv_69048919-640x426.jpeg,0.2078431372549019,eng-7378163,False,0.6745098233222961,0.2078431372549019,378899340,1

The official Twitter handle of OnePlus India posted a morse code message that when deciphered reveals the name of the smartphone.

Introduced in China back in October, the OnePlus 9RT is a top-tier smartphone with a great price tag. Although we don't expect the phone to sell for the same price, chances are that the OnePlus 9RT will remain a flagship killer even outside of China.

Hardware-wise, the OnePlus 9RT looks quite powerful on paper thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, coupled with either 8GB or 12GB RAM. Although it lacks a card slot for memory expansion, customers can choose between the 128GB and 256GB models, which should be enough even for the most demanding users.

Another major selling point of the phone is the massive triple-camera setup (50MP+16MP+2MP) that features a Sony IMX766 image processor, as well as Sony IMX471 for its front-facing 16-megapixel camera.

Also, the OnePlus 9RT boasts a stunning 6.62-inch AMOLED display with HDR10+ support, 120Hz refresh rate, and 600Hz touch sampling rate, which makes it one of the best in its class.

At launch, the OnePlus 9RT was priced to sell in China for about $510/€450, but Indian customers will probably pay a different price of the high-end device. If OnePlus decides to bring the 9RT in Europe too, it will be much more expensive than the Chinese model.","{'uri': 'phonearena.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Phone Arena'}","[{'uri': 'cosmin_vasile@phonearena.com', 'name': 'Cosmin Vasile', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://m-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/137513-wide-two_940/OnePlus-9RT-coming-soon-to-markets-outside-China,0.1529411764705881,eng-7376935,False,0.7215686440467834,0.1529411764705881,378898140,1

In October 2021, the Chinese smartphone giant introduced the OnePlus 9RT alongside the Buds Z2 in its home country, China. Last month, the OnePlus 9 RT and the Buds Z2 were also spotted on the company's Indian website. Finally, OnePlus India has broken its silence on the matter teased the introduction of forthcoming devices with a couple of cryptic teasers on its Twitter handle. The first teaser contains Morse codes, which when decoded, revealed that the OnePlus 9RT will be released in India shortly.

The second teaser video shared by the company also says that the upcoming OnePlus Buds Z2 is also coming soon, probably launching alongside the smartphone. The TWS earphones are currently only available in China, the USA, and some regions of Europe.

The OnePlus 9RT has a 6.62-inch Full HD+ Fluid AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels, 120Hz refresh rate, 1300nits brightness, and HDR10+ support. The display panel also has Corning Gorilla Glass protection and an optical in-display fingerprint scanner.

The handset is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 octa-core SoC manufactured on a 5nm technology. The Snapdragon 888 has an Adreno 660 GPU built-in. Up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of UFS3.1 storage is available on the device.

The smartphone's Chinese version runs Android 12. However, the smartphone was discovered on the Google Play Supported Devices list with Android 11, so it's unclear if the OnePlus 9RT will ship with Android 11 or Android 12 in India. A 4,500mAh battery powers the OnePlus smartphone, which offers 65W Warp Charge 65 rapid charging.

In terms of optics, the 9RT has a triple rear camera configuration with an LED flash. A 50MP Sony IMX766 sensor serves as the device's primary camera.

Coming to the OnePlus Buds Z2, the TWS earbuds include ANC up to 40db, which blocks out ambient noise while also allowing you to hear what's going on around you. There's also a transparency mode, which allows you to hear what's going on around you. The TWS earbuds use the same 11mm, bass-tuned dynamic drivers, as the OnePlus Buds Pro. As a result, we can assume it will deliver high-quality music. There's a three-mic configuration that's been tuned to eliminate noise and wind disturbances, as well as compatibility for Dolby Atmos.

The charging case includes a 520mAh battery that charges through a USB Type-C connection, while each earbud has a 40mAh battery. The earbuds also include a fast-charging feature that allows them to last up to five hours on a single charge.","{'uri': '91mobiles.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': '91mobiles.com'}","[{'uri': 'sandip_chakraborty@91mobiles.com', 'name': 'Sandip Chakraborty', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.91-cdn.com/hub/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oneplus-rt-buds-z2.jpg,0.01960784313725483,eng-7376935,False,0.7568627595901489,0.01960784313725483,378897540,1

So far the fastest charging supported by the OnePlus devices is 65W. With the 80W fast charging speeds, the OnePlus 10 Pro will become the fastest charging OnePlus device, said reports.

A recent report said that the smartphone is expected to sport a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 2K resolution. The screen will be curved on either side and sport a hole-punch cutout at the top left corner.

Other than this, the phone was previously touted to come equipped with a 5,000mAh battery. It will be supported by a 50W wireless charging support. The device is likely to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC as well as LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage.

The device was also spotted on the BIS listing, hinting at an imminent launch. Now, the latest info has confirmed the launch timeline of the Moto G71 in India.

Moto G71 India Launch Timeline Revealed

According to the tipster Yogesh Brar (@heyitsyogesh), the India launch of Moto G71 will be happened by the second week of January. Apart from this, he did not reveal any details. If this turns out to be true, we expect Motorola will soon start teasing the arrival of the device.

Moto G71 Expected Price & Features In India

In terms of features, the Moto G71 is expected to offer similar features as the international variant. This means the Moto G71 would be announced with a 6.4-inch full-HD+ (1080 x 2400 pixels) OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate. The device will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC paired with 8GB RAM and a 128GB internal storage option which can also be expanded using a microSD slot.

For imaging, you'll get a triple rear camera setup housing a 50MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 2MP macro shooter. Upfront, it will sport a 16MP selfie camera placed into a punch-hole cutout. The device will pack a 5,000 mAh battery unit with 30W fast charging support. Other features will include a USB Type-C port for charging, a 3.5mm audio jack, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, Dolby Atmos support, and Bluetooth v5 for connectivity.

As far as price is concerned, the device was launched with a starting price of EUR 299.99 (roughly Rs. 25,200). In India, the phone is expected to arrive under Rs. 25,000. Since the European market price tag is usually higher than the Indian market due to tax. However, we will suggest you take it as speculation and stay tuned for more updates.

Motorola's Other Launches In India

Besides, Motorola is also expected to bring the Moto G200 which was rumored to launch last month in India. However, the brand only launched the Moto G51 and the G31 from the G-series as of now. So, there is a chance the brand might launch the Moto G200 along with the G71 in India.

Apart from these mid-range devices, the company is rumored to bring the flagship Moto Edge X30 soon in the country which was announced as the world's first Snapdragon 8 Gen 1-powered phone in China. If the rumors are to be believed the Moto Edge X30 will be announced by late January or early February in India.

The flagship device also includes a triple rear camera setup that houses a 50MP primary sensor with OIS, a 50MP wide-angle shooter, and a 2MP depth sensor.

The Accused Products infringe at least claim 1 of the '259 Patent by practicing the 802.11ax Standard."" By some media reports, this technology has been used for about 458 mobile products of Samsung.

Acacia further alleged that ""In addition to directly infringing the '259 method claims by using infringing products in the United States, Samsung also indirectly infringes the '259 claims.

Since a spate of leaks had taken away most of the surprises from the launch event, our interests were limited to when these would launch globally and in India.

Now, a reliable tipster claims that the Xiaomi 12 and Xiaomi 12 Pro may get a global launch by end-February or early March, with the India launch happening right after. The leaker, collaborating with MySmartPrice says the base model and the Pro version could launch by early-March.

Meanwhile, another leaker DigitalChatStation claims that the ultra premium Xiaomi 12 Ultra equipped with a periscope telephone lens would go official in China around the first week of February when country celebrates the Spring Festival. So, there will be another global launch of the ultra premium device some time in March or April.

As readers would recall, the Xiaomi 12 and Xiaomi 12 Pro are powered by the 4nm-based Snapdragon 8 Gen-1 SoC, putting them alongside the likes of the Galaxy S22, Oppo Find X4, and OnePlus 10 Pro. These two handsets also get Harman Kardon tuned speakers with Dolby Atmos support to give them some extra gravitas.

The Xiaomi 12 is priced at CNY 3,699 (~Rs. 43,357) for 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. The one with 8GB RAM and 256GB cost CNY 3,999 (~Rs. 46,874) and the top-model with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage will cost CNY 4,399 (~Rs. 51,562).

The Xiaomi 12 Pro variant with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage costs CNY 4,699 (~Rs. 55,000) while the variant with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage comes at CNY 4,999 (~Rs. 58,500). The top-end model with a whopping 12GB RAM and 256GB storage costs CNY 5,399 (~Rs. 63,200).

The company had also unveiled a cheaper Xiaomi 12X variant that came with the Snapdragon 870 SoC. It is priced at CNY 3,199 (~Rs. 37,400) for the base model 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. The one with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage costs CNY 3,499 (~Rs. 41,000), and the higher-end model with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage costs CNY 3,799 (~Rs. 44,500).

Coming to the Xiaomi 12 Ultra, the leaker says the device carries the codename L1 and would have top-notch cameras. The device could arrive with a periscope super-telephoto lens and Leica-powered camera sensors.

Earlier reports had suggested a quad-camera set-up on the rear with a 50MP main shooter carrying a Samsung GN5 primary lens and a 48MP 2x zoom lens alongside a 48MP lens with 5x zoom capability and another 48MP sensor with 10x zoom. All of this was supposed to reside in a rectangular camera island.

However, a report on Gizmochina had shared leaks of the rear case of the phone to indicate that the camera island would be circular on the Xiaomi 12 Ultra. Readers will recall that the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra had a secondary display within a mega camera bump that had appeared to suggest ""you want more, here's more"" to us. Xiaomi seems to be getting rid of the secondary display in the direct successor, going instead with a rather tame circular camera island.

Apart from the shooters, the Xiaomi 12 Ultra appears to get standard updates such as the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, a display that could be around 6.5-to-6.6-inch and a 2K screen resolution 120W rapid charge support. In other words, it mirrors the features of the Xiaomi 12 Pro.","{'uri': 'techradar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechRadar'}","[{'uri': 'raj_narayan@techradar.com', 'name': 'Raj Narayan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v9TAt4ttEyiePnBeBQXU24-1200-80.jpg,0.2,eng-7377557,False,0.6980392336845398,0.2,378893100,1

Leaks hint towards an improved UI and new design and hardware upgrades. Here's everything we know so far about the OnePlus 10 Pro.

Company CEO Pete Lau had previously confirmed on Weibo that the OnePlus 10 Pro will be launching sometime this month. But, a recent leak from tipster Abhishek Yadav hints towards a January 11 launch, supported by a promotional video for the Chinese market.

Judging by the video, the device features a curved display with a punch-hole selfie camera at the top-left corner of the screen. On the backside, you get a matte finish, while the triple-camera setup with the ""Hasselblad"" branding extends into the side panel. The phone is expected to come in four colours - black, teal, purple, and silver (metallic), and also features buttons on either side.

The OnePlus 10 Pro, much like its vanilla OnePlus 10 variant is expected to launch with the new UnifiedOS software, built in collaboration with Oppo. It is described as a blend between the OxygenOS and Oppo's ColorOS, and will soon be available on older OnePlus devices up to the OnePlus 8.

The Realme 9i also appeared on AliExpress, just a day before Christmas and by the end of 2021, it was quite obvious that the phone will launch soon. However, now the device has been officially teased and it looks like the phone will launch first in Vietnam before any other regions, including bigger markets like China and India. According to popular tipster Abhishek Yadav, the launch will take place on January 10.

The teaser of the phone reveals a bit about the design, especially the back and it is quite similar to that of the Realme GT Neo2 with the rectangular camera bump housing the three camera sensors alongside the LED flash. However, from the teaser, we still can't know everything but we surely know that the phone will be offering a side-mounted fingerprint scanner embedded onto the power button.

As of now, not much is known through official channels. However, the earlier appearance of the phone on Geekbench and AliExpress revealed a lot of the specifications of the Realme 9i. The Geekbench listing had already revealed that the phone is being powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 680 SoC paired with 4GB of RAM, carrying the model number RMX3491. The phone was also seen running Android 11 out of the box with Realme UI 2.0 on top. The phone will come only with 4G as the chipset doesn't offer 5G connectivity.

However, the AliExpress listing revealed a lot more. According to the listing, the Realme 9i comes with a 50-megapixel primary camera and a 16-megapixel selfie camera. The listing also revealed a full HD display and from earlier leaks, we are already aware that the phone will offer up to a 90Hz refresh rate.

If the AliExpress listing is correct, we can expect a 5000mAh battery with 33W fast charging, via USB-C. However, we may not see a 3.5mm headphone jack on the Realme 9i. So, for now, we know quite a bit about the phone and it will be interesting to see if Realme comes with a variant of Realme 9i with more RAM and storage. Also, as of now, it is known that the phone will come in two colour variants- Black and Blue. We are keeping an eye on further developments ahead of launch and will share updates regarding the pricing and availability once it is officially launched.","{'uri': 'mysmartprice.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MySmartPrice.com'}","[{'uri': 'jayaditya_chakrabarty@mysmartprice.com', 'name': 'Jayaditya Chakrabarty', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://assets.mspimages.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Realme-9i-Black-03012022.jpg,0.1686274509803922,eng-7378497,False,0.6745098233222961,0.1686274509803922,378890100,1

Recently, Acacia Research Corporation (""Acadia""), announced that its subsidiary, Atlas Global Technologies LLC, has granted a license to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Samsung Electronics America, Inc. (""Samsung"") related to Atlas Global's Wi-Fi 6 standard essential patents and resolved patent litigation between the two parties. Under this settlement, Samsung Electronics has executed a license agreement with Atlas which provides Samsung with the right to obtain a license to the patent-in-suit and be released from the present litigation. Financial terms are confidential and have not to be disclosed.

Acacia is a California, US-based company that seeks to acquire undervalued businesses and pursue opportunities for value creation. They provide (i) access to flexible capital that can be deployed unconditionally, (ii) expertise in corporate governance and operational restructuring, (iii) willingness to invest in out of favor industries and businesses that suffer from a complexity discount and untangle complex, multi-factor situations, and (iv) expertise and relationships in certain sectors, to complete strategic acquisitions of businesses, divisions, and/or assets with a focus on mature technology, healthcare, industrial and certain financial segments. They seek to identify opportunities where they believe they are advantaged buyers, where they can avoid structured sale processes and create the opportunity to purchase businesses, divisions, and/or assets of companies at an attractive price due to their unique capabilities, relationships, or expertise, or where they believe the target would be worth more to them than to other buyers.

Acacia was founded in 1993 by Bruce Stewart who had strong ties to the California Institute of Technology. He was a serial inventor and entrepreneur who valued innovation. Mr. Stewart's vision for Acacia combined investment capital, ideas, and bright people, allowing their emerging inventions to flourish. Under Paul Ryan and Chip Harris, and after successfully licensing its own technologies, Acacia sought to build an independent patent licensing business, mimicking the in-house efforts of successful patent licensing companies like IBM and Qualcomm.

From that origin, Acacia and its patent partners have signed more than 1200 licensing agreements with many of the world's largest companies. Consistent with its innovation heritage, Acacia has returned more than $727,000,000 to its patent partners.

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a South Korean multinational electronics corporation. It is the world's largest manufacturer of consumer electronics by revenue and the world's second-largest technology company by revenue.

Plaintiff filed this complaint about the alleged infringement of the following:

In the complaint, Acacia alleged that ""Samsung directly infringes the '259 Patent under 35 U.S.C. § 271(a) by making, using, selling, and/or offering to sell in the United States, and/or importing into the United States products that directly infringe the '259 Patent, including the above-identified Accused Products. The Accused Products infringe at least claim 1 of the '259 Patent by practicing the 802.11ax Standard."" By some media reports, this technology has been used for about 458 mobile products of Samsung.

Acacia further alleged that ""In addition to directly infringing the '259 method claims by using infringing products in the United States, Samsung also indirectly infringes the '259 claims. Where acts constituting direct infringement of the '259 Patent are not performed by Samsung, such acts constituting direct infringement of the '259 Patent are performed by Samsung's customers or end-users who act at the direction and/or control of Samsung, with Samsung's knowledge.""

Now, with this standard-essential patent license agreement and settlement agreement, all the pending patent litigations would be settled. Order to stay all deadlines and notice of settlement has been issued by the court.

The company has set January 11 to be the date for the reveal of whatever this new SoC will be.

What's exciting is that Samsung itself has said that this next Exynos chip will feature a GPU born from AMD's RDNA 2 architecture. In case that sounds familiar, the setup is used for powering next-gen graphics on the latest Xbox and PlayStation consoles, apart from AMD's very own RX 6000-series graphics cards.

That much power in a smartphone SoC is both unnecessary and impractical so it's safe to say that we're going to see some sort of a modified version of the RDNA 2 architecture on the next Exynos chipset. However, back at Computex 2021, it was indeed mentioned by AMD that it's working with Samsung to bring raytracing and variable rate shading to smartphones with the latter's Exynos chip.

Lisa Su, CEO, AMD had said during her keynote address, ""AMD has partnered with industry leader Samsung for several years to accelerate graphics innovation in the mobile market and we're happy to announce that we will bring custom graphics IP to Samsung's next flagship SoC with raytracing and variable rate shading capabilities.""

MediaTek and Qualcomm have both revealed their flagship chipsets for 2022 already. Both the companies have opted for the 4nm process node and the latest ARMv9 architecture for their processors. Meanwhile, Apple and Google have their own in-house chipsets in the form of the A15 Bionic and Tensor SoC, respectively.

This is the best category for those who need (almost) premium features on their smartphones at an affordable price. Smartphones in this category are expected to have a flawless performance regardless of their price. Companies like Xiaomi and Samsung have multiple options in this category and also lead the sales.

There are lots of powerful smartphones in this category. Gamers benefit a lot from this category as they get a good processor, great battery backup, cooling system and a big quick responsive display. Today, we have prepared a list of the best premium mid-range smartphone currently available in Nepal that will also dominate the market in early 2022.

Here is the list of best premium mid-range smartphones in Nepal.

Tecno Phantom X is probably the best-looking smartphone in this category. It has a premium design, built of the glass front, glass back and a metal frame. There is a Gorilla Glass protection on both sides of the phone. The phone also has a curved display that gives the user a premium feel. It features an under-display fingerprint sensor.

There is a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display and has a massive 91.3% screen-to-body ratio. The display also has a 90Hz refresh rate. The phone weighs 201 grams and is 8.7mm thick. It features a 50MP triple camera setup on the back with a dual 48MP on the front. It is the only phone to have a dual camera on the front on the list. The rear camera can record videos in 4K resolution @ 60 fps.

There is a 4700 mAh non-removable Li-Po battery on the phone that supports 33W fast charging. The phone runs on Android 11 with HIOS 7.6 on top and is powered by Mediatek Helio G95 (12nm) chipset.

The price of Tecno Phantom X is Rs 64,999 for a 8/256GB variant.

Phantom X is a premium-looking phone and is probably the phone with the best design in this category. But, when it comes to performance, every other smartphone on this list gets better. It gets a mediocre processor for this price range and an inferior camera as well.

Samsung Galaxy A52s 5G is one of the best mid-range smartphones from Samsung although the brand has lots of other smartphones in this category. It is one of the latest releases of Samsung with a 5G network connectivity option. The phone has a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels and a refresh rate of 120Hz. The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. It only weighs 189 grams and is 8.4mm thick. It also has an under-display optical fingerprint sensor and an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.

Samsung Galaxy A52s 5G features a quad-camera setup. The 64MP camera on the back is housed together with a 12MP ultrawide, 5MP macro and 5MP depth sensor. On the front, there is a 32MP camera. Both cameras can record videos in 4K at 30fps.

The phone runs on Android 11 with One UI 3.1 on top. It is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 778 5G (6nm) chipset while the graphics are handled by Adreno 642L. For battery backup, there is a 4500 mAh Li-Po battery on the phone that supports 25W fast charging.

The price of the Samsung Galaxy A52s 5G is Rs 53,999 for 6/128GB and Rs 55,999 for 8/128GB variants.

Samsung Galaxy A52s 5G provides a good processor, probably the best camera in this category and a higher refresh rate display with IP certification. This can be a great option for Samsung lovers in this category. It is an all-rounder, good for photography, good for gaming and overall good-performance phone. However, the battery life on the phone could have been better. If you want a great battery backup, you can go for Galaxy M62.

Poco F3 GT has especially been designed for gaming purposes. It is the only phone to have a physical trigger button on the phone itself, which can be opened with sliders that are on the side. Other than this, it has a 6.7-inch AMOLED HDR10+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate that reaches a peak brightness of up to 1300 nits. With a metal frame, the phone has a glass front and back, and both of them are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. This phone is also IP53 certified for dust and splash protection.

Poco F3 GT has a triple camera setup on its rare. The 64MP camera is housed together with an 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro lens. On the front, there is a 16MP camera. The main camera can record videos in 4K at 30fps.

The phone runs on Android 11 with MIUI 12.5 for POCO on top and is powered by MediaTek Dimensity 1200 5G (6nm) chipset. It has a 5065 mAh non-removable battery and supports 67W fast charging. With this power, the phone gets fully charged in just 42 minutes. The audio quality is also good on the phone as it boasts stereo speakers.

The price of the Poco F3 GT in Nepal is Rs 51,999 for an 8/256GB variant.

This is a great deal considering the features Poco F3 GT provides. The UFS 3.1 internal storage on the phone also means faster loading speed and transfer of data. Along with a 120Hz refresh rate display, it also has a whopping 480Hz touch sampling rate, which can be great for gaming.

Though the phone is focused on gaming purposes, it does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack and though it has a 6nm chipset, it could have been better as there are smartphones with Snapdragon chipset which outperforms the flagship Dimensity chipset. Also, cameras are definitely not the strongest point of this phone. But again, considering the price, this is a great deal.

OnePlus has to be on the list as this is the first smartphone brand to actually come out with the idea of a flagship killer. This was the very reason the Nord 2 5G phone got popular in no time. The phone comes with a 6.43-inch Fluid AMOLED HDR10+ display with a maximum resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels. The phone has a glass front, glass back and a plastic frame. The front and back of the phone are protected by Gorilla Glass 5. The phone weighs 189 grams and is 8.3mm thick.

OnePlus Nord 2 5G gets a triple camera setup on the back. The main 50MP camera is accompanied by an 8MP ultrawide and another 2MP camera. The camera can record 4K videos at 30fps while it can record 1080p videos up to 240fps. On the front, there is a 32MP single camera.

The phone runs on Android 11 with OxygenOS 11.3 on top and is powered by MediaTek Dimensity 1200 5G chipset. Giving life to the phone is a 4500mAh non-removable Li-Po battery. The charging of the battery is extremely fast as it supports a 65W fast charger that can fully charge the phone in just 30 minutes.

The price of OnePlus Nord 2 5G is Rs 59,999 for 8/128GB and Rs 69,999 for 12/256GB variants.

Well, OnePlus always has been one of our favourites. The Nord 2 5G is also a good phone and could have been great. The phone has an excellent build quality, one of the best in the segment. The camera performance, as well as the phone's overall performance, is good as well.

However, OnePlus should have provided a better chipset, not that the one it has is a bad one but with the price range, it should have done better. Also, the phone has no IP certification. The battery charging time is fast, but it should also be noticed that the phone has a 4,500 mAh battery while others on the list have 5,000 mAh or over. The price may be a great disadvantage to the phone as the users have multiple options on the market.

Yet another Poco phone on the list, Poco F3 is the best value for money phone on the list. The phone comes with a 6.67-inch HDR10+ AMOLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels. This phone has a refresh rate of 120Hz and it can reach a peak brightness of up to 1300 nits. The phone has a glass front, glass back and a plastic frame. Similarly, the glass on the front and back is protected by Gorilla Glass 5. It is the slimmest phone in this category with only 7.8mm thickness.

It has a triple camera setup. The main 48MP camera on the back is accompanied by an 8MP ultrawide and a 5MP macro lens. The camera can record videos in 4K at 30fps whereas it can record 1080p resolution videos up to 960 fps. On the front, there is a 20MP camera that can record 1080p videos.

Poco F3 runs on Android 11 with MIUI 12.5.6 for POCO on top and is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 5G (7nm) chipset. There is a 4,520mAh Li-Po battery on the phone that supports 33W fast charging and gets fully charged in just 52 minutes.

The price of Poco F3 is Rs 46,999 for 6/128GB and 51,999 for 8/256GB variants.

Poco F3 offers a lot for its price range. It has a solid build, a good design and a good processor. Gaming can be extremely fun on this mobile as it has probably the best chipset in this price range. Also, 120Hz refresh rate and 360Hz touch sampling rate can make the gaming look really smooth. It has a liquid cool technology as well and has hi-res Dolby Atmos speakers.

Though Samsung phones may provide better photo quality, the cameras on this phone are not bad either. Though limited to 1080p, the 960fps should be really handy.

Our pick for the best premium mid-range smartphone is Realme GT Neo 2. This is the best smartphone from Realme in Nepal. Realme has been really innovative this year and has certainly got a lot of attention in the market, thanks to GT Neo 2.

The phone features a 6.62-inch HDR10+ AMOLED display. It has a refresh rate of 120Hz and a touch sampling rate of 600Hz which is the highest in the market. The phone weighs around 199.8 grams and is 9mm thick. The display of the phone has Gorilla Glass 5 protection.

There is a triple camera setup on the phone. The 64MP main camera on the back is accompanied by an 8MP ultrawide and a 2MP macro lens. The camera can record videos in 4K and at 60fps. On the front, there is a 16MP camera that can record 1080p videos at 30fps.

Realme GT Neo 2 runs on Android 11 with Realme UI 2.0 on top and is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 5G (7nm). There is a 5,000 mAh non-removable Li-Po battery and supports 65W fast charging. This gets the phone full charged in just 36 minutes.

The price of Realme GT Neo 2 is Rs 54,999 for 8/128GB and Rs 60,999 for 12/256GB variants.

Realme GT Neo 2 has a good design, good cameras and a good processor. It offers an incredible gaming performance as well. To prevent heating, this phone also has a stainless steel vapour cooling plus system. The 600Hz touch sampling rate on the phone is probably the first on the market in this category. The phone also captures good photos and is good for night photography as well. The battery backup on the phone is also good and can charge pretty fast.

However, the camera performance could have been better on the phone. Though the photos look good, they are inconsistent and the low-light photos are only fine as long as you do not zoom them. The night mode on the phone also gives different outcomes when another subject is added to the frame. However, the selfie camera is good. The phone even provides a bright light on the screen or a night mode when there is low light and the photos are good. Other than this, it is a great phone.","{'uri': 'english.onlinekhabar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'OnlineKhabar English News : English Edition'}",[],https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Premium-mid-range-smartphones-1024x675.jpg,0.419607843137255,eng-7377735,False,0.5215686559677124,0.419607843137255,378882180,2

The company has now officially confirmed that the device will be launched on January 10th, which makes it the first smartphone to go official from the Realme 9 series.

The official render of the Realme 9i is identical to the leaked render. At the back, the phone has a triple camera setup with a 50MP primary sensor. Similarly, there is also an ultra-wide angle lens and a dedicated macro lens with 2MP resolution.

As per the design, the Realme 9i has a plastic frame with a power button and volume buttons located on the right side. The recessed power will also double as a fingerprint sensor. Just like the frame, the back panel of the Realme 9i will also be made using plastic and the phone will be available in multiple colors.

The Realme 9i is a 4G smartphone, as the phone is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 SoC. This is an underpowered version of the Snapdragon 695 and is fabbed using 6nm fabrication. The base model of the Realme 9i will offer at least 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage.

As per the software experience, the phone will ship with Android 12 OS with a custom Realme UI 3.0 skin on top. This will be one of the first mid-range Realme smartphones to ship with the latest version of Android. A 5,000 mAh battery is likely to power the Realme 9i with support for 33W fast charging via the USB Type-C port.

Looking at the specifications, the Realme 9i will be priced around Rs. 15,000 in Vietnam. The smartphone is expected to launch in India in the coming days and is likely to cost a lot less than here when compared to Vietnam.

Along with the Realme 9i, the company is expected to launch models like the Realme 9 and the Realme 9 Pro, which are likely to be 5G smartphones, based on either Qualcomm or MediaTek processors. Also note that the company is also gearing up for the launch of the Realme GT 2 Pro, the first premium flagship smartphone, based on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor.","{'uri': 'gizbot.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gizbot'}",[],https://www.gizbot.com/img/2022/01/realme-9i-1641185275.jpg?03012022102536,0.06666666666666665,eng-7378497,False,0.772549033164978,0.06666666666666665,378881700,2

As per the 3C certification, the OnePlus 10 Pro with model number NE2210 supports output of 7.3ampere at 11V. It translates to a whopping 80W fast charging speed.

So far the fastest charging supported by the OnePlus devices is 65W. With the 80W fast charging speeds, the OnePlus 10 Pro will become the fastest charging OnePlus device, the report said.

Other than this, the phone was previously touted to come equipped with a 5,000mAh battery. It will be supported by a 50W wireless charging support. The device is likely to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC.

A recent report said that the smartphone is expected to sport a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 2K resolution. The screen will be curved on either side and sport a hole-punch cutout at the top left corner.

The OnePlus 10 Pro will come preinstalled with Android 12 OS. As the company had revealed a few months ago, it will be the first device to offer a unified experience of ColorOS and OxygenOS.

In June, OnePlus announced that it has decided to further integrate with its sister smartphone brand OPPO and merge with it in a bid to create better products.

In an official forum note, earlier, Lau said that it will also allow them to be more efficient, for example, bringing faster and more stable software updates for OnePlus users.","{'uri': 'techshout.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechShout'}","[{'uri': 'bhavesh_shah@techshout.com', 'name': 'Bhavesh Shah', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.techshout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/oneplus-9rt.jpg,0.1529411764705881,eng-7376935,False,0.8117647171020508,0.1529411764705881,378881520,2

The report said that the Xiaomi 12 Ultra carrying the codename L1 will have major camera highlights. One of them would be the periscope super-telephoto lens. In addition to this information, a previous leak revealed the device may come with Leica-powered camera sensors.

The smartphone was previously tipped to come with a quad-camera system at the rear. It will boast a 50MP main Samsung GN5 primary lens, a 48MP 2x zoom lens, a 48MP lens with 5x zooming capability and lastly a 48MP sensor with 10x zoom.

Keep it safe with a waterproof casing.

Apple may release its next best in-ear audio device, reportedly called AirPods Pro 2, this year. The new product will sport a refreshed design and be equipped with several other major upgrades, according to a new set of leaks.

The latest set of information about Apple's AirPods Pro 2 came from TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In the latest note to investors, which was discovered by Macrumors, the analyst explained that the second-generation AirPods Pro will have major selling points, which will trigger a strong market demand.

These new features reportedly include a charging case that emits a sound to indicate its location when triggered and support the company's proprietary audio coding format, the Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC).

The charging case will most likely work with the Find My App to highlight its location. Kuo's information seemingly supports previously leaked photos of the Apple AirPods Pro 2, which highlights the charging case with holes.

In terms of the support for ALAC, previous and current generation AirPods do not support this audio coding format because the devices play audio via Bluetooth, which restricts them to the AAC codec. But the latest detail may support what Tom Parsons of What Hi-Fi gathered about the next generation Apple earbuds when he interviewed Gary Geaves, the company's VP of acoustics.

""Reading between the lines, I reckon Apple has a plan for overcoming Bluetooth's current limitations. That could be as simple as switching to Qualcomm's recently announced aptX Lossless format, but I wonder if Apple might have its alternative to Bluetooth up its sleeve,"" Parsons said in an article.

Bloomberg had also reported that the next AirPods Pro could lose the traditional stem and sport a more discrete design having a resemblance to the Beats Studio Buds. The report said the tech giant is testing the design, so it remains to be seen if the final product would look like this.

Earlier rumors suggested that Apple might release the AirPods Pro 2 in the third quarter of 2022, which is a little bit earlier than Kuo's Q4 2022 release window prediction. While these details about AirPods Pro 2 are interesting, they are not official.

Consumers should take these details as highly speculative at this stage. The Cupertino-based tech titan released a Magsafe-compatible case last year, but so far, it has not updated the AirPods Pro after it was launched in the market in 2019.","{'uri': 'ibtimes.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'International Business Times AU'}","[{'uri': 'nica_osorio@ibtimes.com.au', 'name': 'Nica Osorio', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.ibtimes.com.au/sites/au.ibtimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2022/01/03/airpods-pro.jpg?itok=2y9a6jpw,0.388235294117647,eng-7378051,False,0.8235294222831726,0.388235294117647,378878400,1

This is a real treat for Samsung fans to get an early look at how the phone looks in natural light and when being held.

Samsung is a prolific manufacturer, launching several new phones each year and covering a wide range of pricing to meet almost every budget. The most exciting devices, of course, cost more. For example, the top-of-the-line Galaxy S21 Ultra features a 108-megapixel image sensor that allows a 100 times zoom and stabilization so good that a close-up of the moon can be captured. By comparison, the Galaxy S21 and S21-Plus come with a 64-megapixel sensor and can manage a 30 times digital zoom.

Samsung's Galaxy S21 FE is expected to be a lower-cost option for anyone interested in a Galaxy S21, sacrificing build-quality somewhat to bring a lower cost while keeping the integrated style that sets the S21 series apart from many other phones. An unboxing video was spotted by Twitter user @chunv8888. It has been taken down since but was saved to a Google Drive account and can be downloaded and viewed. Another unboxing YouTube video, this time in Italian, is still live, courtesy of HDBlog's channel. In both cases, the Galaxy S21 FE is shown along with its packaging and accessories, unwrapped and held in hand, giving a tremendous real-world look at this exciting addition to the S21 lineup.

Samsung Galaxy S21 FE Looks Great

Multiple unboxing videos have been posted online showing the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE in hand, turning and revealing every angle and detail. It's definitely a nice-looking phone. One video shows an olive-toned Galaxy S21 FE that will stand out by virtue of the unusual color, while the other demonstrates the black model, looking quite stealthy with a matte finish. The only gleam from the back is around the cameras, with a silver ring surrounding each lens.

Specifications are shared in the videos. There are no surprises, matching previous leaks that suggest the Galaxy S21 FE will feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 in some markets, cameras that match the S21 and feature a nice bright screen with a 120-hertz refresh rate. The hands-on video will be a worthwhile watch for anyone interested in this device to see the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE in use before the official announcement.
