And during the past year, competitor Rio Tinto is down 14%, while Polymetal is down 31%. And while Anglo American has risen 20%, it's down 10% from its August high to 3,100p. Similarly, Evraz is up 24% over the past year, but has fallen 12% to 611p from its high in May. These four FTSE 100 miners have been volatile compared to Glencore's steady climb over the past twelve months. This is especially impressive as the miner was also one of the FTSE 100's highest volume stocks last year.

Moreover, unlike its competitors, Glencore is currently matching its 2021 high of 390p. And it's backed as a long-term investment by Qatar's sovereign wealth fund and asset management titan Blackrock.

The electric vehicle (EV) revolution truly began to accelerate last year. Tesla delivered almost a million vehicles in 2021. Ford has developed a competitor car and has assigned $29 billion of funding to develop EVs. Toyota has overtaken General Motors as the top car-seller in the US. The Japanese company will invest $17.6 billion in battery technology and plans to sell 3.5 million EVs by 2030. Newcomers Rivian and Lucid hit the markets with multi-billion dollar valuations, and the Bank of America predicts there could be $100 billion of EV IPOs by 2023.

And this could just be the start. Audi plans to stop selling ICE cars by 2033, and General Motors by 2035. Many other automotive companies have made similar pledges. And according to BloombergNEF consultancy, half of global passenger vehicles sales will be electric in 2035. And with nearly 64 million passenger vehicles sold in 2019, EVs still represent a fraction of the market. As their market share increases, so will the demand for the metal used to make them.

And this could be key to a further Glencore share price surge. Four key metals are essential to the EV revolution: lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper. And Glencore is one of the world's largest miners in three out of four, excluding lithium.

But lithium may one day be replaced with the zinc that Glencore does mine. With battery technology advancing at breakneck speed, experts at Power Magazine believe that the need to process lithium in a highly controlled water-free environment makes it 'more costly, and more complicated,' than using Zinc-ion, which is water-based.","{'uri': 'community.ig.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'IG Community'}",[],https://content.invisioncic.com/o280999/monthly_2022_01/LAGZMJUN3JJ5XOFXBQNA6SPJWE.jpg.190f10eb03a0bb5550bd8d428ba84fb6.jpg,0.2,,False,0,0.2,379122120,1

It's handsome, it offers huge range and it has a comprehensive suite of driver assistance features with its DreamDrive system. Only that last part might not be true for the earliest Air customers, according to a report published on Tuesday by Bloomberg.

It's not totally out of the norm for new vehicles to be delivered without a complete set of features, only to have them enabled later via over-the-air updates -- just look at Tesla and FSD, for example. Still, it would seem that Lucid's communication of this possibility with the Dream Edition Air left something to be desired.

It's not totally clear how neutered the DreamDrive system is on these early cars, and since we don't have a Lucid handy, nor know anyone who does, it's impossible to say definitively, but it's still a bummer for someone who just shelled out around $170,000 for a new car.

Lucid, for its part, offered this explanation in a statement to Roadshow:

""Thanks to our ability to deliver software over-the-air and with key hardware already in place in the vehicle, many of the systems in the Lucid Air are designed to grow over time - including the DreamDrive suite of advanced driver assistance systems. While core DreamDrive functionality was already included in recently delivered Lucid Air Dream Editions, Lucid this week contacted initial Air Dream Edition customers to remind them about an upcoming over-the-air software update that will add additional new features to the DreamDrive suite. The rollout of these features is consistent with what Lucid discussed with these customers before they took delivery of their cars.""

Fully featured DreamDrive or not, we're still very much looking forward to more seat time in the new Air.

COVID-19 has intensified the problem. Opioid-related deaths surged 25% in Ontario in the first few months of the pandemic and continue to be at a crisis point. Premiering Tuesday, January 25 at 9 pm ET on TVO, TVO.org, YouTube and TVO streaming channels, TVO Original Come Clean is a close look at what fuels addiction, as well as the herculean effort and hope recovery demands.

""The reality of addiction seriously impacts individuals, families and communities across Ontario,"" says John Ferri, VP of Programming and Content at TVO. ""With unflinching honesty, Come Clean shares the real struggle of overcoming addictions through deeply personal journeys -- stories that most Ontarians will relate to.""

Written and directed by Derreck Roemer and Neil Graham of Insurgent Projects (Last Call at the Gladstone Hotel, The Lost Highway), TVO Original Come Clean begins on New Year's Eve in the southwestern Ontario farming community of Thamesville, home to Westover Treatment Centre. Cameras roll as the dozen addicts in group 1313 embark on 19 days of in-treatment counselling.

With intimate and unfettered access, the filmmakers embedded round-the-clock at Westover, living alongside the program participants. Post-treatment, filming followed select subjects' stories for 18 months to experience their realities and see who among them could break the habits that landed them in rehab.

Bryanna, Annie, Ryan and Julie, the featured four from group 1313, are as different as their backstories. Ranging in age from their teens to their forties, the common through-line is shame and guilt from early-life traumas that they've been unable to overcome thus far. Come Clean isn't about wallowing in the depths, but the valiant efforts to rise out of addiction's malaise

Freed from drugs during treatment at Westover, the film's subjects are lucid, smart and funny, with a startling degree of self-awareness. But staying clean in rehab is the easy part. The hard work begins once program participants reenter the turmoil of the world.

For filmmakers Roemer and Graham, who specialize in long-term projects, Come Clean challenged them to work in a distinctly different way. With the understanding that each additional day an addict waits for treatment puts them further at risk, Westover admits clients quickly -- which meant the filmmakers didn't know who their subjects would be until two weeks before filming commenced.

""Westover's admissions staff asked prospective clients if they'd participate in a doc film,"" says Roemer, ""and we spent the next two weeks crisscrossing the province to meet those who'd consented, knowing the next time we saw them would be on day one of filming."" It was, says Roemer, ""equal parts stressful and invigorating.""

Directors Graham and Roemer wanted to get to the root of why we're increasingly vulnerable to addiction. Graham's own bout with a painkiller dependency was an eye-opening experience for him. ""Any one of us is susceptible to addiction,"" he said. ""With astronomically high rates of addiction to sex, gambling, food, drugs and technology -- where a misplaced cell phone precipitates a crisis -- none of us are safe from its reach.""

According to Westover's Laird Brush, addicts can stay clean by changing one thing: ""Everything. The way you think, the way you feel, the way you behave, where you work, where you live, and who you hang out with."" But if everything is the goal, what's the reality? How many will be able to make the wholesale changes necessary to redeem a life?

TVO Original Come Clean's featured four:

Bryanna arrived at Westover a victim of a brutal upbringing at the hands of violent, negligent parents. After bouts of bingeing led to suicidal tendencies, twenty-something Bryanna's goals are realistic. ""I just want to feel OK,"" she says. But with her emotional growth stunted by trauma, the main obstacle, according to a counselor, will be overcoming ""the mind of a child in a woman's body.""

Annie came to treatment in her early forties as a self-described ""mess"" with a history of addiction to alcohol, food, gambling and drugs. Her Achilles heel is her alcoholic husband Chris, who Annie, initially, believed to be an asset in her recovery. But in treatment, she learns he puts her at greatest risk for relapse. ""He's the best thing that's ever happened to me,"" she says. ""And maybe the worst.""

Ryan, by his late teens, was a small-town drug kingpin. But arrest and incarceration brought his world tumbling down. His enrollment at Westover is a condition of his parole, and a relapse could lead him straight back to jail. Clear-eyed about his chances for success, Ryan knows abstinence will be hard. ""Probably the hardest thing I'll ever do in my life,"" he says.

Julie is a strong-willed Windsor auto worker and mother of two young adults who had an intense cocaine addiction. A prime example of Westover's mantra that addiction is a response to trauma, Julie's recovery begins when she confronts her childhood and an event that's shrouded her life in regret, shame and guilt.

About Insurgent Projects:

Toronto-based filmmaking duo Derreck Roemer and Neil Graham have worked together for over 20 years, producing and directing everything from shorts to feature-length documentaries. In late 2000, the pair began work on Last Call at the Gladstone Hotel, a film that premiered to critical acclaim and sold-out screenings at the Hot Docs festival, then played festivals worldwide before television broadcasts in Canada and elsewhere. The film garnered Roemer and Graham a Gemini Award for best direction in a documentary series, as part of TVO's documentary anthology The View From Here. In 2009, Graham and Roemer formed Insurgent Projects, and in 2014 released the Canadian Screen Award best-doc-nominee The Lost Highway. In 2018, TVO commissioned Roemer and Graham to create Come Clean.

In return for a wait of a few weeks -- or months -- you get exactly what you want. In the current market, you're likely to save money as well.

While Americans have long been accustomed to finding a car and driving off the same day, ""build-to-order"" is common practice in Europe, and it's the method embraced by electric carmakers such as Tesla, Lucid and Rivian. Now that supply chain delays have created bidding wars for vehicles that land on dealer lots, build-to-order is having a moment in the U.S.

Ford now allows buyers to order some popular models online and have them delivered to a dealership. The company says it took 74,000 new vehicle retail orders in November -- an increase of 64,000 over the previous November.

Most dealerships are eager to take special orders as well.

""That seems to be the hot move right now,"" says Matt Jones, director of corporate marketing for automotive shopping site TrueCar. ""Folks want to get exactly what they want as opposed to buying what's available.""

Ordering a car from the factory might also help you avoid markups from the dealer, says Ron Montoya, senior consumer advice editor and content strategist for car research site Edmunds.

Montoya's aunt recently was shopping for a Subaru Crosstrek and was offered a car on the lot at a local dealer at $3,000 over the sticker price. Instead, she asked the dealer to order one from the factory and paid only the sticker price. ""And these days, sticker price is a good price,"" he notes.

Indeed, the current market is brutal. Casual shoppers are competing with drivers who've lost a car to theft, accident or major mechanical issue. Some buyers are leveraging inflated trade-in prices to offset the thousands over MSRP they're paying on a new ride.

A factory order allows both buyer and seller to take a deep breath.

For a dealer, a special order represents a sure sale rather than the risk that you find your ideal car elsewhere.

For the consumer, build-to-order gives time to reflect and make wise choices. Kelley Blue Book calls ordering a custom-made vehicle a ""smart life hack"" because ""it cuts you out of the emotional process of seeing a car ... and wanting it now.""

If you have the luxury of waiting for delivery, here's how to navigate the build-to-order process.

Shoppers typically order a vehicle one of two ways:

Before you sign anything, get these details from the dealer:

Time frame: The dealer can't give you an exact delivery date, but its ordering system should be able to give you an estimate. Consider going elsewhere if the delivery date is too far out, as manufacturers allot cars to dealerships at different rates.

Changes: Clarify the points of no return. With perhaps months before delivery, you may change your mind about color or options. You may be able to back out completely by a certain date.

Deposit: Typically this is $500 to $1,000. Many dealers don't actually cash the check or run the credit card number since the deposit is really ""just to prove the customer has glue in the game,"" Jones says. Ask what happens to your deposit if you decide to back out.

Documentation: Ask what paperwork you'll receive after placing your order and how to track your vehicle's arrival. Often, dealerships provide a build order sheet that lists the model, final negotiated price and estimated delivery date.

Price: While it's not binding, agree on the purchase price and ask that the paperwork you receive reflect that agreed-upon amount. It should include the negotiated price of the car, any dealer-installed extras that you agree on, taxes, title and license. Ask if this is the amount you'll pay when the vehicle arrives. While rebates and incentives are rare these days, according to Jones, clarify which are reflected in the price and what happens if they change.

Before your car lands at the dealership, make sure you track it periodically or follow up with the salesperson. Once you get a delivery date:

Arrange financing. Find a preapproved car loan. You'll avoid surprises with your credit and have a rate for the dealership to try to beat.

Have your trade-in appraised. A dealership won't give you a trade-in price until you're ready to sign papers on your new car. If you're considering trading in, quotes from internet retailers such as Carvana can help you get the most value for your car.

Ask about incentives. It doesn't hurt to check the manufacturer's website or ask your sales representative in case new incentives are available.

Act quickly. If you have a delivery date or get a call from the dealership, ask if the car will be marked as sold and how long the dealer will hold it. Grab it as soon as you can, Montoya advises.

Inspect the car. Look the car over to make sure the vehicle matches what you ordered and that it hasn't been damaged in transit.

Talk over any trade-in. Ask the dealer to appraise your old vehicle and show them any competing offers. Bear in mind that the sales tax savings of trading may be significant.

Review the deal with the finance office. If the agreed-upon price isn't honored, ask why. You aren't obligated to buy a vehicle on new terms, just like the dealer isn't obliged to honor the old ones. You can walk, or you may decide the difference in price isn't worth the hassle of scrapping the deal and starting the whole process over again.

But Israel-based EV start-up Ree Automotive (NASDAQ:REE) shares were up 6.8% after popping more than 11% in earlier trading.

While shares have been trending down with the tech market recently, Lucid and Nio may be getting affected a bit by Tesla right now. The EV leader reported unexpectedly high production and delivery numbers in the fourth quarter, and investors seem to be acknowledging the hill smaller EV names will have to climb in trying to catch up. But Lucid also is having to address some customer complaints right out of the gate, while Ree is generating some excitement for its shares with a new EV platform displayed at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show (CES).

Shares of Lucid soared in November after the company delivered its first vehicles, but have been lagging ever since. Now there are also some early new owners unhappy that their $169,000 Air Dream Editions have been delivered without some driver-assist features in the DreamDrive software package, according to a Bloomberg report.

Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson apparently heard the complaints that some features including adaptive cruise control were still missing, and said in a message to Air customers: ""We've received questions from many of you around DreamDrive and when additional features (beyond those already active in your Lucid Air) will be available. Many features are in the final stages of testing and are planned to be included in an over-the-air update in January.""

While Lucid and Nio investors are facing some of the headwinds associated with early-stage manufacturing as they both grow and attempt to expand globally, Ree Automotive is currently riding a wave of early excitement. Ree provides modular EV platforms, and hopes to benefit as more and more manufacturers build EVs. The company put its new P7 platform on display at the CES, and says it is ""based on specifications from one of world's largest delivery companies.""

The P7 is being made for delivery van fleets of electric and autonomous vehicles. Investors hope this niche will have a large market, particularly with the autonomous last-mile delivery concept.

While today's jump in the stock may be satisfying for Ree investors, they need only look to Lucid and Nio to remember that these investments are still speculative, and there will be plenty of volatility to come as the sector matures.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'howard_smith@fool.com', 'name': 'Howard Smith', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/660046/lucid-air-exterior-19-copy_u5ck2dF.jpg,0.06666666666666665,,False,0,0.06666666666666665,379114920,12

In early December, I recommended that investors considering Nio (NYSE:NIO) or Lucid as a play on the trend to EVs, split their bet 60/40 in favor of Nio.

A month later, the boost from Citigroup's analyst suggests a 50/50 split might be appropriate for the year ahead.

Here's why.

It's important to point out several pieces of information before you jump online to place an order for LCID stock.

First off, Michaeli's target price is one of the highest of Wall Street professionals covering Lucid stock. The second is that the Citigroup analyst is one of only five people covering the EV company. Barron's contributor Al Root points out that a company of Lucid's size -- $62 billion market capitalization as of writing -- ought to have more than 20 analysts covering its stock. It has just five.

According to MarketWatch, of the five analysts covering LCID, two rate it a buy; one has it at overweight, another has LCID as a hold, and the final analyst recommends investors sell. The low is $16, the high is $60 and the average is $44.33.

Considering it's expected to lose $1.42 a share in 2021 and $1.03 in 2022, there's still a long way to profitability. For this reason, I felt Nio was the least risky of the two EV investments.

Barron's points out that Michaeli rates Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) a sell with a target price of $262, well off its current price above $1,100.

I find it hard to believe TSLA stock is going to lose 77% of its value over the next 12 months -- it just reported that it delivered 308,000 vehicles, 17% higher than the analysts' estimate. However, there's no question that Elon Musk's baby is becoming more like a traditional car company with every passing day.

Lucid and companies like it are the future of EVs.

""'We are constructive on the Lucid story and its position in the EV/Car of the Future theme,' wrote the analyst in a report on Monday [Jan. 3]. He believes Lucid has industry leading range and charging performance as well as solid internally developed self-driving features,"" Root reported.

Following on Michaeli's investment thesis for Lucid and Tesla, I'm guessing he would put Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) in the same camp as Lucid because it's still in pre-sale mode. At the same time, Nio would likely be valued more along the lines of Tesla because it has been delivering EVs since July 2018.

So, putting words in the analyst's mouth, the potential upside for Lucid's valuation is much greater than Tesla's because as the volumes build in 2022 and beyond, the company's value would follow along.

Or, put another way, investors will pay more for potential than they will for actuality.

I don't think there's any question that LCID stock is an excellent long-term speculative buy.

Here's what I had to say about Lucid in December: ""That said, it sits in an enviable position with strong pre-orders worth $1.7 billion, a factory in Arizona that can produce up to 34,000 vehicles a year, and $4.8 billion in cash on its balance sheet.""

The one thing I didn't say in my article is that Lucid has the best range and charging performance in the EV industry. That's important given past concerns from consumers regarding EV range.

As Kelley Blue Book stated in November 2021, fears about range are fading. But until they do, Lucid has you covered due to the superior range and charging speed; therefore, many affluent consumers will likely go for the Lucid Air Dream Edition R, which has a range of 520 miles, 100 miles better than its nearest competitor.

Here's What to Know.,"Lucid announced via Twitter that ""Expansion to European markets will begin this year. Stay tuned for country-specific delivery information."" No further details were released at the time.

Despite the announcement, shares of LCID stock are in the red today. Furthermore, shares of LCID stock have declined by more than 16% the past month. While there is no company-specific news to explain the decline in price, high-growth technology stocks have been hammered in 2022 so far. Investors may be retreating to safer, more profitable and lower duration names amid a tightening in tapering. The Fed also announced that it expects up to three rate hikes during 2022 to combat inflation.

While the European expansion news is certainly positive for shareholders, Lucid still has a lot to prove. The EV company last reported that it had 17,000 reservations for its Lucid Air model, up from 11,000 in July. Looking forward, Lucid forecasts that it can deliver up to 250,000 per year by 2026. Meanwhile, Lucid's current production facilities can only produce 34,00o cars per year, which means that Lucid has to aggressively expand its output in order to reach its goal. Lucid is currently working to expand its AMP-1 facility, which is estimated to produce 90,000 vehicles per year by 2023. New and expanded facilities will equate to expenses in the short term, which may be a headwind for LCID stock.

However, CEO Peter Rawlinson seems prepared to take on these challenges. He explained, ""We see significant demand for the award-winning Lucid Air, with accelerating reservations as we ramp production at our factory in Arizona.

Automakers race to beat Tesla on electric car battery range,"In the race to try to catch Tesla when it comes to electric car supremacy, automakers are literally going the extra mile - at least when it comes to battery output.

With the auto industry turning its full attention to the development of stylish long-range electric vehicles, car companies are looking to be able to boast about gains in how far their cars and SUVs can travel on a single charge as the way to separate themselves from the pack.

Mercedes-Benz just unveiled a concept vehicle for the CES tech trade show in Las Vegas that it says is capable of going up to 620 miles before it runs out of juice.

While Mercedes' Vision EQXX is only a prototype - it's not clear when or if its technology can be transferred to a production vehicle - it is surrounded by real-world competitors showing impressive gains in going the distance.

►No longer nerdy: Electric vehicles dominate our most anticipated cars, trucks list for 2022

There is no shortage of them.

Mercedes' announcement was followed by General Motors CEO Mary Barra revealing the new electric version of the Silverado pickup willbe rated at 400 miles per charge. It's due in fall 2023 at a starting price of $39,900.

It will put it solidly in the company of other new vehicles like the latest long-range version of Tesla's luxury Model S sedan, which can travel up to 406 miles on a single charge. Ford Mustang Mach-E SUV can go up to 314 miles. And Mercedes' new EQS sedan can slide along the highway for up to 350 miles.

The leader at the moment is the new electric Lucid Air luxury car with an estimated EPA range of up to 520 miles.

They are the kind of numbers automakers hope will light up indifferent buyers.

""They are trying to make a splash...They are trying to stand out,"" said Jessica Caldwell, director of insights for Edmunds.com. ""It's giving them that 'wow' factor.""

Despite all the attention they have received, electric cars remain only a blip on sales charts. But with a slew of new models on the way amid pressure from the government's fuel economy rules, there's hope the electric transportation future is finally taking shape.

Range isn't just a gimmick to entice motorists to trade gas pumps for power plugs. It helps allay car shoppers' fears that batteries will run dry on a long trip and leave them stranded miles from the nearest charging station.

Next comes the question of how much range is enough.

►Sign up for our cars newsletter: Car aficionados can expect auto news, reviews, and other fast shiny content.

The first round of the industry's electric cars about a decade ago couldn't go much further than 80 to 100 miles depending on conditions. That was ""barely acceptable,"" said Ron Cogan, publisher of the Green Car Journal.

The jump to 200 miles of range made more sense and 300 miles ""takes away a lot of the range anxiety,"" Cogan said. But 600?

That's far enough to drive from Dallas to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Or Nashville to Pittsburgh. Or San Francisco to Las Vegas.

A range of 500 or 600 miles could allow people to be assured they can take their electric cars across the country and get to the destination even if a charging station is closed en route. While Tesla has created its high-speed Supercharger network, the nation's charging infrastructure isn't fully built.

Six hundred miles of range could also allow motorists to skip charging along the way altogether, avoiding having to sit for an hour while their batteries gulp enough electrons to get them zipping along the highway again. They could charge in their own garages then not again until they reach their destination.

Think of driving from Dallas to Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Nashville to Pittsburgh or San Francisco to Las Vegas one day in the near-term future. Your batteries could make it nonstop even if your bladder can't.

Mercedes-Benz isn't alone in chasing the 600-mile dream. General Motors is after it too.

In her CES presentation, Barra said GM is working on electrifying heavy-duty trucks as well as everyday cars and trucks. The lineup will have ""a range needed to get the toughest job done,"" she vowed.

The Detroit-based ain't has unveiled a new generation of batteries packing 60% more energy and costing 40% less than the previous ones. They would be good for up to 450 miles of driving per charge. It's the generation after that one that could produce 500 to 600 miles per charge with twice the battery energy density, announced Mei Cai, GM's Lab Group general manager, last year.

Mercedes-Benz said it achieved a 600-mile range in the Vision EQXX through a raft of improvements, including improving the battery's chemistry, packing the cells tighter and moving electrical and electronic components to a separate compartment.

The car also has wind-cheating aerodynamics, roof panels that collect solar power and lightweight aluminum brakes.

""Electric range sounds easy but is a complex technical challenge,"" said Joerg Bartels, Mercedes vice president for vehicle engineering, in a statement. ""With Vision EQXX, we're presenting the results of an extraordinary challenge: we pushed efficiency to a totally new level.""

Amid the bevy of electric vehicle (EV) start-ups, there's no denying that ElectraMeccanica Vehicles (NASDAQ:SOLO) stands out. The automaker's flagship vehicle has three wheels, has room only for the driver and no passengers, and bears the same name as the stock's ticker: SOLO.

To call SOLO stock a speculative investment would be quite an understatement. It remains to be seen whether even the most open-minded EV buyers will embrace these unconventional vehicles.

The stock has had some fluctuations: In the span of 15 months, the SOLO share price made a dizzying round trip from $2 and change to almost $10 and back. Still, risk-tolerant investors might salivate at the prospect of a turnaround in 2022. So, is it time to go YOLO with SOLO?

The company's corporate prospectus shows that there are some salient risk factors for the start-up EV manufacturer.Perhaps unsurprisingly for an EV start-up with a niche product, ElectraMeccanica has had losses so far. The company managed to incur a net loss of $11.6 million in the first half of 2021, and that was after posting a net loss of $63 million in full-year 2020. Still, ElectraMeccanica's bottom-line performance (or lack thereof) isn't far out of line with that of other EV start-ups. For instance, during 2021's first nine months, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) incurred a staggering net loss of $3.7 billion, while Fisker (NYSE:FSR) lost $109.8 million within that same time frame.

ElectraMeccanica's net loss of ""only"" $11.6 million in H1 2021 might suggest that the company's fiscal bleeding will continue to slow down, but don't get your hopes up. ElectraMeccanica has openly acknowledged that the company has ""minimal revenue,"" anticipates ""generating a significant loss"" for the next alone in this regard. But then, this isn't very different from other EV start-ups that don't necessarily expect near-term full-production ramp-ups. Not to keep picking on Lucid, but that company has similarly incurred net losses each year since inception, and expects to ""incur increasing expenses and substantial losses for the foreseeable future."" Meanwhile, Fisker's most recently released business outlook mentions hundreds of millions of dollars worth of operating expenses and capital expenditures, but nothing about working toward a net profit

So, these EV start-ups are essentially in the same leaky boat. In any case, with a reported accumulated deficit of $122 million, ElectraMeccanica is going to have to sell an awful lot of those three-wheeled wonders just to make ends meet.

As of late November, sadly, it's evident that ElectraMeccanica hasn't sold many SOLO vehicles.

Or at least, it's evident to pretty much everyone except the company's CEO, Kevin Pavlov. Pavlov actually proclaimed in a sales update, ""ElectraMeccanica continues to execute, delivering 42 SOLO EV vehicles as of November 30th.""

Bear in mind that those 42 deliveries include both ElectraMeccanica's reservation and fleet holders. Undeterred, Pavlov and company are forging ahead -- their persistence can't be denied, at least.

With disappointing sales figures abroad, ElectraMeccanica's stalwart shareholders will have to pin their hopes on the company's foray into the ultra-competitive U.S. EV market. How's that going, then?

At least we can acknowledge that the company has taken baby steps in its U.S. expansion. In mid-December, ElectraMeccanica announced that the 2023 SOLO EV was undergoing validation testing at a dedicated temporary testing facility Rochester Hills, Michigan.

With that -- and with self-confidence that might actually trump that of Elon Musk -- Pavlov declared that his company is ""executing on all fronts."" There is a pretty apparent theme here. In a press release wherein Pavlov used both ""execute"" and ""execution,"" ElectraMeccanica provided a timely update on its Mesa, Arizona-based assembly facility.

Spanning an impressive 235,000 square feet, this facility will evidently have a production capacity of up to 20,000 vehicles per year -- ""by Americans for Americans,"" as the press release emphasizes.

Of course, the ability to produce vehicles is entirely separate from the ability to sell them. Until some fresh and encouraging delivery numbers come in -- which might not happen for a while, since the facility's purpose is to assemble a 2023 SOLO EV model -- ElectraMeccanica's faithful investors might find themselves driving in the slow lane.

Ultimately, SOLO stock is an all-or-nothing gamble. Folks will either learn to love these solipsistic EVs or they won't.

Thus far, the financial and sales data don't support a long position in ElectraMeccanica. If the share price is to return to its prior peak, it will require more than the CEO's boundless optimism.

So, there's really no middle ground when it comes to SOLO stock. Unless you're absolutely smitten with Pavlov's vision of diminutive electric cars on the roadways, it's probably best just to leave ElectraMeccanica alone.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'david_moadel@fool.com', 'name': 'David Moadel', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659422/gettyimages-1143388723.jpg,-0.02745098039215688,,False,0,-0.02745098039215688,379106760,3

The Taiwan-based company is debuting its first portable, private 5G experience on a wireless VR headset in a partnership with Lumen Technologies. HTC made the announcement at the CES 2022 tech trade show in Las Vegas.

Enterprises will now have access to their own private, secure 5G infrastructure and network - and it's the size of a carry-on suitcase.

VR experiences can run anytime, anywhere in just 30 minutes - in even the most remote locations and enjoy high-resolution, low latency wireless VR experiences that are on par to PC VR/tethered VR experiences, said Shen Ye, senior director global head of hardware products at HTC, in an interview with GamesBeat.

And HTC unveiled a new wrist-based tracker that allows you to track from the fingertips to elbow, even when the headset can't see the tracker, Ye said. He demoed it for me in a virtual session and showed how it fits around your wrist in a form-fitting way so that it stays in place at the part where you flex your joint.

It's designed for use with Vive Focus 3 VR headset and is 85% smaller than a Vive Focus 3 controller and 50% lighter. You can even attach the tracker to objects, which enable them to have six degrees of freedom (6DoF). It works with the Vive Focus 3 because it has inside-out tracking, using cameras on the device that capture a lot of your movement.

However, cameras can't see everything. When you move your hand behind your head, like with a golf swing, the VR headset has to calculate your hand locations based on the momentum sensors (via gyros or accelerometers). And when you cover one hand with another, a camera can't see the hand. So the wrist tracker uses embedded infrared LEDs for tracking, along with the momentum sensors.

""We want to enable hand tracking, but hand tracking with cameras has limits,"" Ye said. ""If you block your hands with one arm, you are limited. A tennis swing is out of the field of view of cameras. Trackers let you do a ton of prediction, and the wrist tracker helps a lot.""

HTC also showed off new charging accessories for Vive Focus 3 including a 4-in-1 charging dock and charging case, making it easier for arcades, location-based entertainment venues and other large group experiences to quickly charge Vive Focus 3 on-the-go without long pauses in between games or training sessions.

It is also showing demos for LBE and hand tracking. This allows users to accurately operate co-location tracking in a shared space without individually re-calibrating. It also has better hand-tracking accuracy and more. You can put a tracker on something like a water bottle and track it better. HTC is showing a firefighter training app that shows how you can track someone's hands and see exactly where they are pointing a water hose.

HTC's partners from Dreamland XR will showcase new content from Chicken Waffle and City Lights that leverages LBE and hand tracking features. Ye foresees consumer applications like dancing games or fitness apps that could make use of the trackers.

And the portable HTC Vive Flow VR glasses will have new content like a new dreaming application called Dreaming with Dierdre that helps with problem-solving and lucid dreaming, as well a new meditation, ocean exploration, and mental health content.

HTC is also showing new games like After the Fall and Shadow of Valhalla for the Vive Pro 2 VR headset.","{'uri': 'venturebeat.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'VentureBeat'}","[{'uri': 'dean_takahashi@venturebeat.com', 'name': 'Dean Takahashi', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VIVE-Wrist-Tracker-open-4-bg.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,0.1215686274509804,eng-7386280,False,0.7686274647712708,0.1215686274509804,379105080,1

Chevrolet opened a new front in the Truck Wars on Wednesday, vowing its electric Silverado EV pickup will beat the Ford F-150 Lightning on a host of key performance metrics, including driving range, towing capacity, power and passenger space.

It's the first salvo as the battle for pickup supremacy shifts to a critical new theatre: Electric vehicles.

GM CEO Mary Barra unveiled the Silverado EV -- scheduled to go on sale in the second quarter of 2023 -- in her keynote address Wednesday to the CES electronics show in Las Vegas. GM plans to stream Barra's address on its Exhibit Zero website: gmexhibitzero.com/en-us.

The Silverado EV will debut as a 2024 model with prices starting at $39,900, Chevrolet vice president of marketing Steve Majoros said.

Full-size pickups like the Silverado, F-150 and Ram 1500 are U.S. automakers' top selling vehicles, generating billions of dollars in profits annually. They also are among the most technically challenging vehicles to electrify. Pickup owners expect to be able to tow heavy trailers and haul cargo long distances, frequently including muddy worksites and fields. Towing is expected to reduce EV pickups range significantly, and the trucks' heavy batteries may limit their usefulness off paved surfaces.

Automakers that crack the code to combine the performance pickup owners demand with environmental benefits and expected low operating costs expected from EVs will be sitting pretty as U.S. vehicles evolve away from internal combustion engines.

GM will build the Silverado EV and other electric vehicles including the GMC Hummer EV ""super truck"" and Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV at its $2.2 billion Factory Zero assembly plant, which straddles Detroit and Hamtramck.

2022 Lucid Air: Electric luxury sedan may be best car in the world by middle of 2022

The Silverado EV is a five-passenger crew cab, measuring 233 inches long, 80 inches wide and 76 inches high -- about the same as a current short-box Silverado crew cab.

Chevrolet claims a long list of ""firsts"" and ""bests"" -- 24-inch tires, 10,000-pound towing capacity, 1,300-pound payload, 400-mile range and a glass roof, for a start -- will vault the Silverado EV to leadership among electric pickups, despite going on sale more than a year after the Rivian R1T, which is available now, and many months after Ford's F-150 Lightning, expected to go on sale this spring.

Silverado EV sales should begin in the second quarter of 2023.

Unlike other high-profile electric vehicles -- Ford Mustang Mach-E, Lucid Air, R1T, every Tesla -- which began sales with opulent top-of-the-line models, the first Silverado EVs off the assembly line will be work trucks with prices starting at $39,900.

It's unclear what, if any, federal tax credits the Silverado EV will qualify for, due to legislative gridlock in Washington, D.C.

The Silverado EV will have a 5-foot, 11-inch bed, independent suspension and either two or four motors.

Key features of the $39,900 electric work truck:

The $105,000 RST first edition personal-use Silverado EV will heap on more power and features, including:

The Silverado EV's DC fast charging ability -- up to 350 kW or 800 volts -- will allow drivers to add 100 miles range in 10 minutes.

Chevrolet won't say how long it will take to DC-charge to 80%, or for a full charge at 240v, the most commonly cited competitive figures for other EVs.

The Silverado EV's exterior styling is more adventurous than the evolutionary F-150 Lighting. Both pickups share a full width LED lightbar more or less across where the front edge of the hood would be on a conventional pickup. The similarities end there.

While Ford took pains to make the F-150 Lighting look like conventional F-150s -- same cab size and profile, identical beds -- Chevy created a whole new pickup look for the Silverado EV.

Pickups, even expensive, luxurious ones, work for a living, so the new form follows function in ways that take advantage of an EV's unique engineering. The cab is bigger than conventional Silverados, creating more passenger room and storage. The A-pillars slant sharply back for a sloping windshield and aerodynamic benefits.

""Our electric vehicle architecture let us rethink the whole usage of space,"" designer Chip Thole said. ""We've got a very short front overhang and better rear legroom than any crew cab pickup.""

The EV architecture is so stiff -- thanks to the fact that the Silverado's big battery pack is a structural part, linking the frame rails and filling the space between the axles -- that engineers made the body a single piece, eliminating the open space between cab and bed that allows current pickups to flex in response to heavy loads. That continuous profile contributes to excellent aerodynamics, reduced wind noise and the Silverado EV's unique appearance.

The Silverado EV's interior features a pair of big LCD screens, one for instruments, the other a touch screen that controls many features. However, designers studiously retained buttons and dials for frequently used functions like volume, audio tuning, temperature and fan speed.

""We firmly believe knobs and buttons are necessary for some functions,"" chief engineer Nichole Kraatz said. Other popular features like heated seats can be programmed so they're always available at a single touch.

There's no start button or key. The Silverado EV will unlock when its key fob, or a phone or card programmed to start it, approaches. Step inside and the pickup is ready to drive away. It shuts off when you walk away and lock it.

The work truck's range is TBA, but will be shorter than the expensive RST's 400 miles. That's not surprising. Business fleets often have more predictable service areas and hours than personal use vehicles.

Chevy will begin sales with the work truck for fleet or individual customers in the second quarter of 2023. The RST first edition should go on sale that fall.

Other models will follow, include lower priced personal use vehicles and a work truck capable of towing 20,000 pounds, well into the range of current heavy-duty pickups like the Silverado 2500 and Ford F-250.","{'uri': 'usatoday.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'USA Today'}",[],"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/01/03/PDTF/5fd547c2-1130-4201-97b8-8c3184d78a10-IMG_1123.jpeg?auto=webp&crop=4031,2267,x0,y373&format=pjpg&width=1200",0.07450980392156858,,True,0,0.07450980392156858,379105080,3

As we see the slow fade of the internal-combustion engine, as well as some thorny problems with the sustainability of the materials used in electric car batteries, might the next step be a ""solar car"" that gets much of its power from photovoltaic panels on the roof?

That's the premise of Lightyear One, a Dutch company that raised US$110 million last year to put its large and luxurious five-seat hatchback into production next summer. ""We are at the forefront of a historical market opportunity, by introducing the first cars on the market that charge their battery directly from the sun, completely free,"" says Lex Hoefsloot, founder and CEO of Lightyear, adding that the company plans to introduce the Lightyear One exclusive model in 2022.

The all-wheel-drive car has a very aerodynamic drag coefficient somewhere under 0.20, similar to the Lucid Air or Mercedes EQS electrics. The attractive shape was drawn by Italy's GranStudio. Its efficient electric motors are in the hubs of the four wheels, and it rides on ultra-low-rolling-resistance Bridgestone Turanza Eco tires.

The drivetrain is claimed to have 97% efficiency. Hoefsloot also says the car's weight is under 2,900 pounds (via aluminum and carbon fiber) and features ""the most efficient inverters on the planet."" The flat aero wheels have fender skirts in the rear to make them more aerodynamic, and the wind-blocking rear-view mirrors have been replaced with cameras (not yet legal in the U.S.)

To achieve this level of efficiency, Lightyear isn't trying to create a performance car. The One has 136 horsepower on tap, and a zero to 60 miles per hour time of about 10 seconds.

The solar roof has 53 square feet of solar panels. The result is a car that, when parked on a sunny day, can add about seven miles of range per hour, or 25 miles total on cloudy days. This type of solar add-on is not exclusive -- the forthcoming Fisker Ocean also has solar panels, which it says can add four or five miles per day.

The 2022 cars in Lightyear's first series, for Europe only, will be priced at US$169,000. Only 946 will initially be put together by Finland's Valmet Automotive, which builds cars to order. The cheaper mass-produced Lightyear One that could reach American consumers will appear in 2024.

In June, at Aldenhoven Testing Center in Germany, the company was able to get more than 440 miles on a single charge of its 60-kilowatt-hour battery pack (translating to 7.3 miles per kilowatt-hour). Those results were achieved on a closed track at a steady 53 miles per hour, which is likely to yield better results than moving through stop and go traffic -- or driving faster.

In a video, Hoefsloot predicted that by the end of the decade ""people won't think about charging or range anymore -- the energy will just be there."" That seems very optimistic. Unless Lightyear has achieved amazing breakthroughs in solar efficiency, owners of these early solar cars are still likely to be plugging them in. The Lightyear One is fast-charge compatible.

Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for e-mobility at Guidehouse Insights, points out that vehicles are ""highly suboptimal"" as a host for solar panels because they have to lie flat on the roof. ""Panel output is highly dependent on the angle of incidence of the sun's rays to the panel,"" he says. ""Ideally, you want the panel to be as perpendicular to the sun's rays to generate maximum power. That's why stationary solar arrays are tilted the way they are.""

Abuelsamid says he tested a Hyundai Sonata hybrid with the optional solar roof last year, and observed what happened with its power generation gauge. ""I parked it in my driveway in the sun, and after eight hours it didn't even fill the 1.5-kilowatt-hour hybrid battery,"" he says. ""That means less than two miles of range at even very slow speeds.""

Alistair Weaver, editor in chief of Edmunds.com, said in an interview that in many current cars, such as the new Mercedes Vision EQXX and Fisker Ocean, the solar panels ""are more of a top-up solution, rather than a way to power the whole car. In hot climates, it's common sense to use solar. If your commute is 15 miles and you live in Arizona and park outside, you will probably get somewhere.""

Toyota offers a solar option on its Prius, but the company said that in 2019, working with Sharp, it has come up with an onboard solar battery panel with an output of 860 watts, 4.8 times higher than that of its own Prius plug-in hybrid model.

Solar-powered cars work well for racing, and Lightyear One's panel design grew out of Solar Team Eindhoven's vehicles for the World Solar Challenge. The team's latest creation is Stella Vita, a mobile home that is described as a ""self-sustaining house on wheels.""","{'uri': 'barrons.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Barrons'}","[{'uri': 'jim_motavalli@barrons.com', 'name': 'Jim Motavalli', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://images.barrons.com/im-462487/social,0.1843137254901961,,False,0,0.1843137254901961,379104600,1

Those paying attention were also treated to an official announcement that fans of a certain vehicular combat game have been looking forward to for years: a Twisted Metal television series really is in the works. Rumors regarding this particular project have been bouncing around the web since May 2019.

The TV show is being spawned from the ashes of a failed movie adaptation, originally set to be directed by Brian Taylor, who acted as the co-director for Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Sony later scrapped this idea after budget concerns, but given the massive scale of the new Uncharted film and the upcoming adaptation of The Last of Us, they might want to reconsider.

Twisted Metal hasn't released a proper game in a decade, with the last main entry hitting the PlayStation 3 in 2012. The series was a huge hit during the original PSX era following two original releases in 1995 and 1996. As for the story, players take the wheel in a deadly demolition derby complete with nuclear weapons and plenty of ammunition, with the last driver alive being crowned the winner. While no story for the television series has been announced, it will likely follow the game's original story: the Twisted Metal tournament is run by a man named Calypso. There's plenty to build off of with such a simple premise, and given that participants in the race include the Grim Reaper and a murderous clown, casting should be a hoot.

Although now officially confirmed, no release window has been set for the Twisted Metal television series. In September 2021, it was announced that PlayStation had given the series to UK-based developer Lucid Games, and a revival is currently in the works. While still in early development, some are speculating that the title may be free-to-play.","{'uri': 'gameranx.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gameranx'}","[{'uri': 'carley_garcia@gameranx.com', 'name': 'Carley Garcia', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://gameranx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Gks3pNAv1jS1tdSZ4kw2EDjw8Uwdkv.jpg,0.06666666666666665,eng-7392729,False,0.7764706015586853,0.06666666666666665,379103700,1

Anyone else have to deal with Covid in the household over the holidays?

So much can change in two weeks, so I always proceed through this first reopening week of the year with caution and let the optimism of investors for the year ahead settle while the unsolved problems of last year catch up. Still, there are some early signs the world of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing is in for some big changes this year. Consolidation may be the name of the game.

As Marsha Vande Berg points out in her first column of 2022 below, the messy world of sustainability standards and metrics is beginning to come together, with major regulators preparing this year to adopt standards that will greatly enhance the ability of companies to report climate risk, and investors to react.

This morning's news that S&P Global is buying The Climate Service, a four-year-old climate risk data provider, also portends the beginning of a period of acquisitions after a frantic three years of startups and VC investing as climate data continues to improve. The outlook for a demand surge in electric vehicles this coming year means a big year for components makers as well, in terms of sales and merger offers as the largest players jockey for position.

Finally, some of the corporate marketing and greenwashing tactics of the past few years are growing old and tainted, as investors become more educated about which green strategies they want to pursue and why. And that's no small thanks to improved media climate coverage across the board, including this stunning special report by The New York Times over the weekend called Postcards from a World on Fire.

We face steep challenges to be sure, including Covid, higher inflation, higher interest rates, geopolitical risk, and worse supply chain issues. But the ESG world is growing up, and after years of talk, the biggest players are starting to lay their bets.

The alphabet soup of competing sustainable standard initiatives is beginning to come together in a way that will make 2022 a pivotal year for environmental, social and governance investors, writes Marsha Vande Berg. Key will be how the European Union and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S. adapt their regulatory frameworks to sustainable disclosure, with a key set of standards that can be applied in different ways.

Recent tests of a solar panel prototype may have demonstrated breakthrough technology in the effort to harness solar energy from space. E&E News reports the prototype, called a ""sandwich tile"" by researchers, was able to harness intense solar radiation found in outer space and then convert it into radio frequency energy that could be beamed back to Earth. The project is called the Arachne mission and is a joint effort by the Air Force Research Laboratory and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC). According to the report, it's researching the possibility of harnessing solar energy through space-based panels and then ""beaming"" the power back to Earth through wireless technology. The Air Force Research Laboratory awarded Northrop Grumman more than $100 million for the project.

Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a new year's address that the country's domestic flights should be fossil-fuel free by 2030. According to a report from the BBC, however, she acknowledged that the solutions are not yet in place to achieve that goal. Denmark is aiming for a 70% cut in overall carbon emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. ""To travel is to live and therefore we fly,"" said Frederiksen, announcing her plan. The report also notes that Airbus has announced plans to develop hydrogen-fueled planes that could be in use by 2035, while Sweden also has plans to make its domestic flights fossil fuel-free by 2030 and hopes to make international flights green by 2045. Meanwhile, France is considering a ban on domestic flights where the same journey could be made by train in under two-and-a-half hours.","{'uri': '247wallst.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': '24/7 Wall St.'}",[],https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/imageForEntry2-TeA.jpg,0.1294117647058823,,False,0,0.1294117647058823,379103460,1

Believe it or not, I hoped that this trend would catch on about a decade ago. Tech giants like Google (Waymo), Huawei (AITO), Apple, and Sony all want a slice of the EV autonomous tech space. But what if I told you that recent rumors suggest that Tesla is now considering making a phone. See what I mean about these two spheres merging together?

Anyway, back to the Sony Vision S-02 concept. Well, it's 2022, and it would be foolish for a company gunning for the EV market to not have an SUV/Crossover up its sleeve. Well, that's exactly what the Vision S-02 concept is.

It follows the same design language that debuted on the stunning Vision S-01 concept developed with Magna Steyr. Although the Vision S-02 being a crossover sits taller and wider.

Going by the proportions, it looks like this crossover is aimed straight at the Tesla Model Y and the dimensions are proof of it at 192.7 inches long, 76 inches wide, and 65 inches tall. The 20-inch wheels and the light bars, both front and rear certainly add some drama to the otherwise plain and minimalist design.

Step inside and that similar aesthetic continues into the cabin as well. In 2022 and screens it seems are the name of the game. Pretty much the entire dash is dominated by an end-to-end screen similar to what we've seen on Sony's own Vision S-01, Honda E, the Mercedes Benz EQS, and the Mercedes Benz Vision EQXX. The glass bubble roof floods the cabin and makes this bright cabin feel even airier than it actually is. Expect the sound system to sound rather good, as is expected from Sony.

The cabin can seat anywhere between four to seven passengers depending on the configuration you choose. With just four seats on, the back seats in fact remind me of early Lucid Air prototypes. I hope this kind of layout catches on in more cars in the future. Rear seat passengers also get their own screens. Hey, this is Sony after all that we're talking about.

Finally, let's talk powertrain. The Sony Vision S-02 is powered by a pair of electric motors with each of them producing 268 horsepower, which in my opinion is more than adequate for this kind of vehicle.

Specifics about the battery size, estimated range, etc are yet to be announced, but going by how heavy the Vision S-02 weighs, i.e 5467 pounds, the batteries sure must be pretty hefty and the range just as good.

The car also has sensors at various points on the bodywork including the likes of CMOS and LiDar that would help support its level two autonomous driving technology. Sony also showed off connected autonomous driving tech, where a Vision S Prototype at a test course in Aldenhoven, Germany was driven remotely from Tokyo in Japan. Such tech could go mainstream when 5G rolls out in a bigger way in the future.

The compact luxury crossover EV space is getting hotter by the day and the Model Y could soon face some stiff competition from the likes of not just legacy automakers, but also tech giants like Sony with their new Vision S-02. There isn't any word on when the Vision S cars will hit the road and if Magna Steyr will play a role in the production as well, but this second concept in just two years does show promise that we aren't too far away.","{'uri': 'topspeed.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Top Speed'}",[],https://pictures.topspeed.com/IMG/crop/202201/sony-vision-s-ev-15_1600x0w.jpg,0.1686274509803922,,False,0,0.1686274509803922,379102260,1

On a single charge, the Vision EQXX can travel from New York City to Cincinnati, Berlin to Paris, or Beijing to Nanjing. In comparison to other long-range EVs on the road today, such as the Lucid Air (520 miles) and Tesla Model S Long Range Plus, it's outstanding (402 miles). Unlike those vehicles, however, the Vision EQXX is only a concept with no intentions for mass manufacture. (For the time being.)

Mercedes-Benz eventually presented the automobile (virtually) at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, after weeks of teasing. (Due to an increase in COVID-19 instances, Mercedes, like most of the large firms, abandoned its intentions to attend CES in person.)

The Vision EQXX will most likely serve as the basis for a production car that will compete with other luxury electric vehicles such as the Porsche Taycan, Audi E-Tron GT, and Tesla Roadster, thanks to its sporting goals and sleek, futuristic style.

The Vision EQXX, unlike earlier Mercedes ideas, is said to be more grounded in reality. The business states that its range estimates were based on a simulation of real-world traffic circumstances, implying that it will burn energy at a rate of 10kWh every 100 kilometers, or more than 6 miles per kWh. In terms of fossil-fuel consumption, this equates to about 235 miles per gallon in the United States or 1 liter of gasoline per 100 kilometers.

To put this in context, Mercedes says that 10kWh is the equivalent of three hours of use of a tumble dryer or air conditioner or 50 hours of viewing on a 50-inch LED screen.

Despite these simulations and estimates, Mercedes claims that the Vision EQXX's superior range is ""absolutely realistic"" and that the Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture will integrate many of the Vision EQXX's technology breakthroughs into future production cars.

Mercedes says it achieved this energy efficiency not by cramming an oversized battery under the floor of the vehicle but by ""pull[ing] out all the stops in drivetrain efficiency, energy density, aerodynamics, and lightweight design... The result is an efficiency masterpiece.""

A vehicle with a gross weight of 1,750 kg (3,858 lbs), which places it more in the category of compact SUVs than sports cars, can undoubtedly be described as lightweight. The battery pack, which contains roughly 100 kWh of energy yet has 50 percent less volume and 30 percent less mass than the Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan, is most likely the source of that weight. Mercedes claims a ""benchmark"" coefficient of 0.17 based on a 140km/h wind tunnel test, which is an improvement above the EQS' record-setting 0.20 drag coefficient.

A range estimate Is, after all, just that: a guess. Any EV range will be certified separately by the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States, as well as Europe's Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). The majority of electric vehicles on the market now have a range of 200-300 miles, with some older versions having less. The latest generation of electric vehicles has a range of 250-300 kilometers.

Mercedes, like the majority of its competitors, is speeding toward an all-electric future. By 2030, Mercedes-Benz says it would invest €40 billion ($47 billion) on electrifying its whole lineup, including electric versions of its G-class wagons and AMG high-performance vehicles.

These pronouncements come at a time when most major countries are attempting to limit the sale of internal combustion engines in the next decades. By 2035, the European Union, China, and California have all stated that internal combustion engine automobiles will be banned.

Ford's stock jumped more than 11 percent to its highest level since 2001 after the Detroit automaker said it will nearly double production capacity for its red-hot F-150 Lightning electric pickup to 150,000 vehicles. It said the model has already attracted nearly 200,000 reservations https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-caps-f-150-lightning-orders-200000-ceo-farley-2021-12-09 ahead of its arrival this spring at U.S. dealers.

GM rallied 7.3 percent a day ahead of its public debut of the Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup, which is slated to go on sale in early 2023. GM CEO Mary Barra is set to unveil the Silverado EV at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Tesla's announcement on Sunday that it delivered 308,600 vehicles https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/how-tesla-weathered-global-supply-chain-issues-that-knocked-rivals-2022-01-04 in the fourth quarter, crushing analysts' forecasts of 263,026, also heightened excitement about electric vehicles, one of the hottest investment themes on Wall Street. Tesla shares climbed more than 13 percent on Monday, but gave back 4.4 percent on Tuesday.

Ford has now gained nearly 17 percent over two days, a strong start to the year after surging 136 percent in 2021. GM has climbed 12 percent over two sessions, adding to its 41 percent gain last year.

Not all of Wall Street's EV makers got a lift on Tuesday. Rivian dipped 0.8 percent, leaving its gain since its initial public offering in November at 31 percent. Lucid Group lost 4 percent, while Nio dipped 5 percent.

The rally in GM shares came even after Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp released data showing it outsold GM in the United States in 2021, marking the first time the Detroit automaker has not led U.S. auto sales for a full year since 1931.

Ford CEO Jim Farley in early December told CNBC host Jim Cramer that Ford had to stop taking reservations for the Lightning.","{'uri': 'producer.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Western Producer'}",[],https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/05104143/Ford-electric-F150-lightning.jpg,0.3019607843137255,eng-7385065,False,0.4313725531101227,0.3019607843137255,379100820,1

Aimed at affluent first-adopters in an EV market accustomed to $100,000 Porsche Taycan and Tesla Model S sports sedans, the loaded, $105,000, 2024 Silverado RST pickup will lead the EV truck parade, followed by other model trims in 2024. A 400-mile-range, fleet-focused Work Truck is scheduled to go on sale in spring 2023, while the RST is due to arrive in late 2023.

Like Lightning, Silverado EV pricing starts at just under $40,000 before government tax breaks. Unlike Lightning, which uses a familiar F-150 ladder frame, the Silverado EV makes a clean break from its petrol-powered Silverado stablemate with an all-new platform based on GM's 800-volt Ultium battery skateboard and capable of fast, 350-kW charging. It's the same architecture that cradles the Hummer EV -- GMC's first foray into the e-pickup space.

""We have a foot in both camps,"" said Chevrolet marketing guru Steve Majoros as the brand will now produce trucks on gas and electric platforms. Majoros and the Silverado team gave media a sneak peak of the pickup ahead of its official CES intro.

After the fleet-customer Work Truck and top-shelf RST retail model, production will ramp up in 2024, with models like the base WT ($39,900 with a smaller battery) and DFC, RST and Trail Boss models stickering at $50,000-$80,000.

Chevrolet's Dearborn rival is already taking orders with four trims advertised to hit the market this spring: Lightning Pro ($39,974, excluding 1,695 destination charge), XLT ($52,974), Lariat ($67,474), and Platinum ($90,874).

The big-battery, 400-mile Work Truck (price yet to be determined) aims to help corporate fleets satisfy ESG (environmental, social, and governance) demands of green investors by filling their fleets with zero-emission vehicles.

""The Silverado EV (provides) customers with a true work-capable truck to help them begin the transition to an electric fleet and assist them in achieving their own sustainability goals,"" said GM Fleet VP Ed Peper.

The retail strategy will initially target premium EV buyers who also have the coin for, say, a $105k Mercedes EQS EV. Pickups like the Silverado High Country have become prized by luxury items in recent years, though the RST EV will cost $40,000 more than a fully-loaded V8-powered High Country.

For that price, buyers will get a lot. The Silverado EV is a rolling tech showcase. It plays in the same space as other luxury trucks from startups like Rivian, Bollinger, and Tesla boasting big performance numbers that high-torque batteries can deliver.

The same Ultium batteries that rocket the tri-motor, $112,595 Hummer from 0-60 mph in 3.0 seconds will get the dual-motor Silverado RST there in under 4.5 seconds. Credit a gob-smacking 664-horsepower and 780 pound-feet of torque. The high-voltage platform rivals the Porsche and Lucid Air luxury cars and can add 100 miles of range in 10 minutes at a fast charger. The Chevy's 400-mile range bests Lightning by 100 miles.

""The Ultium Platform enabled our design and engineering teams to start from a clean slate and create a pickup with impressive performance,"" said Nichole Kraatz, Silverado EV chief engineer, who added the architecture allows over-the-air software updates to improve the truck over time.

The truck's sprawling, 145.6-inch wheelbase sits on giant, 24-inch wheels and an independent air suspension -- its profile sleeker than the similarly-sized, gas-powered Silverado. For range-extending aerodynamics, the hood and cowl are lower. A fashionable, LED light runs the width of the grille-less front fascia, similar to Lightning. Silverado EV doesn't share any body panels with its gas brother.

Step up into the cabin and the truck turns on via card, key, or phone app recognition. Interior space is palatial. Twin 11-and-17-inch screens anchor the dash with a 14-inch head-up display projected over the hood. Drivers can delve deep into the infotainment menus while driving hands-free with SuperCruise semi-autonomous tech. Also notable is a Tesla-like column shifter and class-leading 7 gallons of console storage space.

The pickup's signature piece is the bed.

A flying buttress C-pillar -- reminiscent of the 2013 Chevy Avalanche pickup -- frames the 5' 11"" bed that can be extended to 9 feet (10' 10"" with the tailgate down) by dropping the Multi-Flex Midgate wall and window behind the rear, crew-cab passengers. It's not as radical looking as the angular Tesla Cybertruck, but it's distinct from traditional, boxy Silverados. The gate can be split 60/40 -- or drop flat with storage for the removable window. The rear Multi-Flex Tailgate offers multi-functionality like walk-in steps or a work table.

""This is not a conventionally-styled pickup,"" said designer Ryan Vaughn. ""It's more muscular, more sleek. It's driven by functionality. The electric range is important.""

The bed's utility is aided by the stiff chassis structure that sits atop the Ultium platform -- the battery low for improved center of gravity. An underbody shield runs the length of the truck, helping keep road noise from the cabin.

The RST offers four-wheel steer for maneuverability in tight spots on and off-road. Hook up a trailer and it will tow 10,000 pounds -- though that will likely compromise range. TFLTruck.com estimates towing degrades mpg in a gas/hybrid-powered trucks by 70% -- and will take a similar toll on battery range.

Without an engine up front, the void below the hood is used as an e-frunk (front trunk) that can hold three pieces of luggage. Frunks were popularized by Tesla EVs and the Ford Lightning offers its own lockable cavity. Overall, the RST and Work Truck feature 10 charging outlets, which Chevy says can be used to power a tailgate party, home or even another EV.

The fleet-focused Work Truck will arrive ahead of the RST and will be more spare while still boasting 400-mile range. The Multi-Flex Tailgate is unavailable and power downsized to 510 ponies and 615 pound-feet of torque. Payload? 1,200 pounds compared with the RST's 1,300, with towing capability at 8,000 pounds.

The Work Truck is distinguished by a black fascia -- shades of its gas peer.

Chevy bills the six-figure RST as a ""statement truck"" -- a halo EV to lure customers and encourage dealers to invest in EV infrastructure. It will likely compete with the $92k Lightning Platinum, the top trim of Ford's EV pickup. Of Chevy's 2,900 dealers, Majoros says 2,000 have been certified to sell low-volume Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV crossovers, making them equipped for Silverado EV sales too.

Chevrolet is bullish on the California market. The Golden State not only has the nation's most onerous environmental regulations but also its biggest EV sector, with nearly half of American EV sales. Silverado is the No. 1 selling pickup in Los Angeles.

The Silverado EV will be assembled alongside the Hummer EV at the Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center, the plant retooled with an EV-focused, $2.2 billion investment.","{'uri': 'detroitnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Detroit News'}",[],"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/01/05/PDTN/b2c1a8bc-7e79-47d6-94af-d8b0c05f9583-SilveradoEV_RST_charge.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5900,3319,x0,y33&format=pjpg&width=1200",0.1607843137254903,eng-7385065,False,0.729411780834198,0.1607843137254903,379100160,1

Simone Griffith, 26, has lived in Austin for about a year and a half, since a caseworker from another Texas county dropped Griffith off after she was released from a psychiatric institution for mental illness, her lawsuit says. She was experiencing homelessness when she was arrested in October 2021 and charged with criminal trespass.

The suit calls out Austin Police Academy training specifically. Attorney Rebecca Webber, who serves on the city's Public Safety Commission, asserts in the lawsuit that officers at the academy ""were trained to treat unhoused people like vermin."" The suit cites 2018 American-Statesman reporting, when a former cadet related that instructors told cadets they would punch them in the face if they said they wanted to be officers to help people.

Just before her arrest, Griffith was sleeping behind a strip mall off U.S. 183 in East Austin because she had nowhere else safe to sleep that day, the suit says.

Someone called the police, and an officer -- identified in the lawsuit only as Rodriguez -- was dispatched on a trespassing call, the lawsuit says. He ordered her to leave the property.

Austin voters in May brought back a ban on public camping, after the Austin City Council had lifted the ban in 2019. A few months ago, city officials acknowledged they stepped up enforcement of Austin's camping ban.

""Rodriguez did not offer to help Simone find a safe place to sleep,"" the lawsuit says. ""He did not offer Simone any help whatsoever.""

Griffith refused to get up, told him she wasn't doing anything wrong and yelled rude things at him, according to the suit.

Rodriguez called for backup and told Griffith three more times to get up, her arrest documents say. Then another officer -- also only identified by his surname, Escamilla -- arrived.

""Having spent 180 entire seconds futilely repeating the same commands, Rodriguez decided to arrest Simone because Rodriguez and Escamilla knew of no other approach to communicating with a frightened human being,"" the lawsuit says.

Escamilla and Rodriguez tried to handcuff Griffith. She pulled back and ""proceeded to strike/scratch my face with her right hand and was screaming belligerently,"" arrest records say. ""Officer Escamilla and I proceeded to tell (Griffith) not to resist, but she kept fighting back. (She) began kicking me as I was trying to gain control of her hands/arms to place handcuffs on her.""

What happened next was captured by a bystander and shared with KXAN-TV.

The officers first trapped Griffith up against the building, then dragged her off the curb, the video shows. One officer kneed Griffith in her side, then punched her eight times.

Austin police policy allows officers to punch people during an arrest only if the person is resisting arrest and if the force is reasonable.

Prosecutors later dropped the criminal trespass charge against Griffith, Webber said.

The Austin Police Department said in a statement that it is reviewing the officers' actions.

""Anytime a police officer uses force, the incident deserves to be scrutinized,"" the statement says. ""APD has a robust force review process. This process starts with the on-scene supervisor and ends with a review by the Force Review Unit and the officers' chain of command. Once all of the evidence is gathered, the facts of the incident are reviewed for compliance with APD policy and state law. At any time during this review, if it determined there are possible policy violations, an Internal Affairs investigation will be initiated.""

The lawsuit describes Griffith as ""profoundly mentally ill."" A check of public records shows previous arrests in East Texas on charges of misdemeanor theft, misdemeanor resisting arrest and misdemeanor assault.

""She is an easy target for those who prey on vulnerable people,"" the document says. ""When Simone is lucid, she remembers her past traumas and understands how susceptible she is to further mistreatment and abuse. At times in her life, Simone has been institutionalized, but no government agency or institution takes responsibility for her safety. Simone has no one to protect her. She has been subjected to physical and sexual abuse living on the streets. She is deeply traumatized by her experiences.""

The suit in federal court contends that Rodriguez and Escamilla violated Griffith's Fourth Amendment right to be protected from excessive force and her Fourteenth Amendment right to fair and equal treatment.

Griffith is seeking an unnamed amount in monetary damages for her physical pain, ""past and future mental anguish from the trauma of being assaulted,"" and attorney fees, court records show.","{'uri': 'statesman.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Austin American-Statesman'}",[],"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/01/04/NAAS/544b2ccd-9139-4250-9b83-a75857716c9b-Screen_Shot_2022-01-04_at_10.07.48_AM.png?auto=webp&crop=433,244,x0,y19&format=pjpg&width=1200",-0.2627450980392156,,True,0,-0.2627450980392156,379100100,1

Chevrolet opened a new front in the Truck Wars on Wednesday, vowing its electric Silverado EV pickup will beat the Ford F-150 Lightning on a host of key performance metrics, including driving range, towing capacity, power and passenger space.

It's the first salvo as the battle for pickup supremacy shifts to a critical new theatre: Electric vehicles.

GM CEO Mary Barra unveiled the Silverado EV -- scheduled to go on sale in the second quarter of 2023 -- in her keynote address Wednesday to the CES electronics show in Las Vegas. GM plans to stream Barra's address on its Exhibit Zero website: gmexhibitzero.com/en-us.

The Silverado EV will debut as a 2024 model with prices starting at $39,900, Chevrolet vice president of marketing Steve Majoros said.

Full-size pickups like the Silverado, F-150 and Ram 1500 are U.S. automakers' top selling vehicles, generating billions of dollars in profits annually. They also are among the most technically challenging vehicles to electrify. Pickup owners expect to be able to tow heavy trailers and haul cargo long distances, frequently including muddy worksites and fields. Towing is expected to reduce EV pickups range significantly, and the trucks' heavy batteries may limit their usefulness off paved surfaces.

Automakers that crack the code to combine the performance pickup owners demand with environmental benefits and expected low operating costs expected from EVs will be sitting pretty as U.S. vehicles evolve away from internal combustion engines.

GM will build the Silverado EV and other electric vehicles including the GMC Hummer EV ""super truck"" and Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV at its $2.2 billion Factory Zero assembly plant, which straddles Detroit and Hamtramck.

2022 Lucid Air: Electric luxury sedan may be best car in the world by middle of 2022

The Silverado EV is a five-passenger crew cab, measuring 233 inches long, 80 inches wide and 76 inches high -- about the same as a current short-box Silverado crew cab.

Chevrolet claims a long list of ""firsts"" and ""bests"" -- 24-inch tires, 10,000-pound towing capacity, 1,300-pound payload, 400-mile range and a glass roof, for a start -- will vault the Silverado EV to leadership among electric pickups, despite going on sale more than a year after the Rivian R1T, which is available now, and many months after Ford' F-150 Lightning, expected to go on sale this spring.

Silverado EV sales should begin in the second quarter of 2023.

Unlike other high-profile electric vehicles -- Ford Mustang Mach-E, Lucid Air, R1T, every Tesla -- which began sales with opulent top-of-the-line models, the first Silverado EVs off the assembly line will be work trucks with prices starting at $39,900.

It's unclear what, if any, federal tax credits the Silverado EV will qualify for, due to legislative gridlock in Washington, D.C.

The Silverado EV will have a 5-foot, 11-inch bed, independent suspension and either two or four motors.

Key features of the $39,900 electric work truck:

The $105,000 RST first edition personal-use Silverado EV will heap on more power and features, including:

The Silverado EV's DC fast charging ability -- up to 350 kW or 800 volts -- will allow drivers to add 100 miles range in 10 minutes.

Chevrolet won't say how long it will take to DC-charge to 80%, or for a full charge at 240v, the most commonly cited competitive figures for other EVs.

The Silverado EV's exterior styling is more adventurous than the evolutionary F-150 Lighting. Both pickups share a full width LED lightbar more or less across where the front edge of the hood would be on a conventional pickup. The similarities end there.

While Ford took pains to make the F-150 Lighting look like conventional F-150s -- same cab size and profile, identical beds -- Chevy created a whole new pickup look for the Silverado EV.

Pickups, even expensive, luxurious ones, work for a living, so the new form follows function in ways that take advantage of an EV's unique engineering. The cab is bigger than conventional Silverados, creating more passenger room and storage. The A-pillars slant sharply back for a sloping windshield and aerodynamic benefits.

""Our electric vehicle architecture let us rethink the whole usage of space,"" designer Chip Thole said. ""We've got a very short front overhang and better rear legroom than any crew cab pickup.""

The EV architecture is so stiff -- thanks to the fact that the Silverado's big battery pack is a structural part, linking the frame rails and filling the space between the axles -- that engineers made the body a single piece, eliminating the open space between cab and bed that allows current pickups to flex in response to heavy loads. That continuous profile contributes to excellent aerodynamics, reduced wind noise and the Silverado EV's unique appearance.

The Silverado EV's interior features a pair of big LCD screens, one for instruments, the other a touch screen that controls many features. However, designers studiously retained buttons and dials for frequently used functions like volume, audio tuning, temperature and fan speed.

""We firmly believe knobs and buttons are necessary for some functions,"" chief engineer Nichole Kraatz said. Other popular features like heated seats can be programmed so they're always available at a single touch.

There's no start button or key. The Silverado EV will unlock when its key fob, or a phone or card programmed to start it, approaches. Step inside and the pickup is ready to drive away. It shuts off when you walk away and lock it.

The work truck's range is TBA, but will be shorter than the expensive RST's 400 miles. That's not surprising. Business fleets often have more predictable service areas and hours than personal use vehicles.

Chevy will begin sales with the work truck for fleet or individual customers in the second quarter of 2023. The RST first edition should go on sale that fall.

Other models will follow, include lower priced personal use vehicles and a work truck capable of towing 20,000 pounds, well into the range of current heavy-duty pickups like the Silverado 2500 and Ford F-250.","{'uri': 'freep.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Detroit Free Press'}",[],"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/01/03/PDTF/5fd547c2-1130-4201-97b8-8c3184d78a10-IMG_1123.jpeg?auto=webp&crop=4031,2267,x0,y373&format=pjpg&width=1200",0.07450980392156858,eng-7385065,False,0.7568627595901489,0.07450980392156858,379099500,3

The news comes less than a month after FedEx took delivery of its first batch of BrightDrop EV600 electric vans in Inglewood, California.

The massive Walmart order was announced during a call with BrightDrop president and CEO Travis Katz, FedEx regional president of the Americas and EVP Richard Smith, and Walmart SVP of last mile Tom Ward. Katz was understandably positive throughout the call, citing that BrightDrop's Ultium-based delivery vans took a mere 20 months to get from concept to production stage, making them one of the most quickly developed GM products ever (if not the quickest) while highlighting BrightDrop's role in helping Walmart and FedEx meet their stated 2040 sustainability goals.

""E-commerce deliveries are growing at an exponential rate,"" explained Katz (paraphrasing, a bit, from notes). ""Some experts say that we'll soon see 100 million packages delivered every day in the US alone, and we're helping FedEx (our first customer) eliminate those 'last-mile' emissions that are the unseen footprint of the e-commerce.""

As for the deal itself, Walmart signed an agreement to reserve 5,000 of BrightDrop EV600 and smaller EV410 electric delivery vans (the exact product mix wasn't disclosed, but the EV410 won't be ready until next year) in order to support the company's growing ""last mile delivery network"" at 3,400-plus existing retail stores.

FedEx, meanwhile, signed an agreement with BrightDrop reserving priority production for 1,500 more electric delivery vans over the next few years, as part of the shipping company's ""standard schedule of vehicle replacement"" (per Smith, on the call). This agreement is in addition to FedEx's initial reservation of 500 BrightDrop EVs announced last year.

FedEx's Smith also spent some time on the call heaping praise on BrightDrop's EP1 electric container. In the company's Toronto and New York-based pilot programs, they saw a 25% increase in package deliveries per day on routes using the EP1 electric container, allowing FedEx to remove one on-road vehicle from those delivery routes and cut delivery vehicle curbside dwell time in half, ""when used on routes in a high-density, vertical urban environment - all while reducing physical strain on couriers.""

Call me a labor sympathizer, but when a company representative talks about reducing back injuries and improving quality of life for their workforce on a call, I'm going to give them an attaboy for it.

BrightDrop isn't the only option out there

Just like it says above, BrightDrop isn't the only game in town for either of these companies. While it might make sense that Rivian doesn't want to bend over backward for Walmart as it expands into the e-commerce space dominated by their biggest investors, there are plenty of other companies out there who might be willing to do so - with even more appearing at just about every other trade show.

During the Q&A session of the call, Barron's Jim Motavalli asked Smith if FedEx had explored a similar deal with GM's Amazon-backed competitor Rivian. Smith was a bit cagey about the subject, saying only that there were ""some ongoing talks with other companies"" before saying that GM's ""footprint,"" specifically its broad, nationwide dealer network, made the company feel confident that they'd be able to quickly repair or replace any vehicle that ""went down"" anywhere in the country.

Electrek's Take

GM still has the largest dealer network in the US, citing 4,232 dealers on its corporate website at the time of this writing. Most consumers can probably make do with a loaner or rental if they find their Tesla or Lucid is in the shop for repairs, but downtime like that adds up for companies like FedEx that are always on the move. Until the startups have an answer for a service network with that kind of reach, the legacy car brands may have a leg up on the commercial side of the car business - but that window won't be open forever. GM and Ford need to move, and move now, to stay ahead.

As for Stellantis and Ram, it might already be too late for them.

The Tokyo-based tech company displayed the car at the CES 2022 conference, rolling out a sleek gray crossover/SUV at the end of its show.

CEO Kenichiro Yoshida also announced Sony was starting a new company called Sony Mobility Inc. to focus on the development of electric vehicles.

""Sony Mobility Inc. will harness the potential of mobility,"" Yoshida said, adding the company was exploring a commercial launch for electric vehicles. ""This is a bold step into the future.""

Sony called its entry into the electric vehicle market a way to ""promote the accommodation of a large variety of lifestyles within a society where values are becoming increasingly diversified"" in a video and news release on Tuesday.

Sony, known as a gaming company for its popular Playstation consoles, says it plans to revolutionize its electric vehicles as an entertainment space with 360 degree audio, 5G tech and in-car gaming experiences.

""We believe Sony is well-positioned as a creativity-themed company to redefine mobility,"" Yoshida said.

Sony showed off its first prototype of the Vision-S 01 in 2020 and the company began developing and testing the vehicle in Europe last year.

The electric vehicle market is heating up as automakers across the world look toward the future of automobiles in an era where nations want to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles.

Other popular EV startups include Rivian, which has won the backing of Ford and Amazon, as well as California-based Lucid, a rival of the popular EV automaker Tesla.","{'uri': 'thehill.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Hill'}","[{'uri': 'brad_dress@thehill.com', 'name': 'Brad Dress', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sony_041619getty.jpg,0.1764705882352942,eng-7384366,False,0.772549033164978,0.1764705882352942,379099140,1

The final standards, for Model Years ( 2023 through 2026, leverage advances in clean car technology to unlock $190 billion in net benefits to Americans, including reducing climate pollution, improving public health, and saving drivers money at the pump. The final rule also delivers more net benefits to consumers than the proposed rule showcasing how zero-emission vehicles are more affordable and more efficient for consumers. The ambitious standards through 2026 also set the light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas program on track to provide a strong launch point for the Agency's next phase of standards for MY 2027 and beyond. EPA is planning to initiate a separate rulemaking to establish multi-pollutant emission standards under the Clean Air Act for MY 2027 and later that will speed the transition of the light-duty vehicle fleet toward a zero-emissions future consistent with President Biden's Executive Order, ""Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks."" While these standards are ambitious, they provide adequate lead time for manufacturers to comply at reasonable costs. EPA's analysis shows manufacturers can comply with the final standards with modest increases in the numbers of electric vehicles entering the fleet. By MY 2026, EPA projects that the final standards can be met with sales of about 17 percent electric vehicles (EVs), and wider uptake of advanced gasoline engine and vehicle technologies available today. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, $7.5 billion is allocated for EV charging and related programs with a target of having 500,000 public charging stations by 2030, with a focus on creating a convenient national network and providing equitable access to rural drivers and overburdened and underserved communities. More than $7 billion is set aside for investments in battery manufacturing, materials, and recycling to drive down costs, increase sustainability, and build the batteries that will power the future vehicles here in the United States. The surge in charging infrastructure investments coupled with battery technology advancements, increased range, and reduced battery and vehicle costs are making EVs more attractive than ever to consumers.

Furthermore, the chief challenger alternative is currently the EV. This almost guarantees exponential demand growth on EV peripheral businesses. ChargePoint is one, so CHPT stock has a viable bullish long term thesis.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) opened the door, and new entrants like Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) and Fisker (NYSE:FSR) are busting in. They will add to the EV ubiquity at an exponential rate. This is not counting the old dogs learning new tricks, like Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).

While the manufacturers could face problems adjusting to lower margins, it's a gift to CHPT. The more EVs on the road, the larger the opportunity becomes.

In spite of this obvious long runway ahead of the company, the stock has flailed of late. It remains well off its 2020 highs, which came late that year. And since then CHPT leaked out 60% of its value. The good news is that this is more about expectations than operational problems. The 2020 excessive exuberance is normalizing. This happens through stock price deterioration but not the company prospects.

The fundamental thesis behind owning ChargePoint stock for the long term remains the same. The fluctuation in the stock is more about investor sentiment. I wrote about an upside opportunity in October, which delivered more than 20% of quickly. Alas, the rally ended and price reverted back to the base near $18 per share.

However, therein lies the opportunity now. At these levels, investors likely have more conviction. The evidence for that is that they bought the stock up from here several times already. In November 2020, CHPT rallied 160% from around $18 per share. They retested the levels vigorously three months later and then again twice recently.

Investors can assume it holds again to serve as a base. Therefore, the long-term upside opportunity in CHPT stock remains favorable. There will be technical resistances at $22 and $26 per share. However, having solid footing below should embolden owners to not bail as quickly as last January.

Since this is an early mover in a young EV market, its fundamental metrics are not yet a selling point. The income statement is still small with revenues of $160 million. Its price-to-sales may even suggest a small bloat situation, but that's not a concern yet. First and foremost, startups need to concentrate on growing their top line.

I called it a ""startup"" even though it is not one. ChargePoint started in 2007, but back then the market was completely different. Thanks to Tesla, EVs are everywhere, and on track to continue to contend for dominance. My only caveat is that success will depend heavily on finding better battery technologies.

Regardless of what form that happens, ChargePoint should have a good opportunity to grab its fair share. To state the opportunity plainly, there's a gigantic potential addressable market in charging electric vehicles.

Now that I've excited you about the opportunity there, it's time to temper enthusiasm. The S&P 500 is breaking records, therefore we may be susceptible to corrections. If and when they happen, they will put downside pressure on all stocks.

Therefore, it makes sense to only take partial positions regardless of conviction levels in CHPT stock. I would suggest using options to reduce out-of-pocket expenses and remain bullish the opportunity.","{'uri': 'investorplace.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'InvestorPlace'}",[],https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chargepoint-sbe-1600.jpg,0.0980392156862746,,False,0,0.0980392156862746,379097520,1

Simone Griffith, 26, has lived in Austin for about a year and a half, since a caseworker from another Texas county dropped Griffith off after she was released from a psychiatric institution for mental illness, her lawsuit says. She was experiencing homelessness when she was arrested in October 2021 and charged with criminal trespass.

The suit calls out Austin Police Academy training specifically. Attorney Rebecca Webber, who serves on the city's Public Safety Commission, asserts in the lawsuit that officers at the academy ""were trained to treat unhoused people like vermin."" The suit cites 2018 American-Statesman reporting, when a former cadet related that instructors told cadets they would punch them in the face if they said they wanted to be officers to help people.

Just before her arrest, Griffith was sleeping behind a strip mall off U.S. 183 in East Austin because she had nowhere else safe to sleep that day, the suit says.

Someone called the police, and an officer -- identified in the lawsuit only as Rodriguez -- was dispatched on a trespassing call, the lawsuit says. He ordered her to leave the property.

Austin voters in May brought back a ban on public camping, after the Austin City Council had lifted the ban in 2019. A few months ago, city officials acknowledged they stepped up enforcement of Austin's camping ban.

""Rodriguez did not offer to help Simone find a safe place to sleep,"" the lawsuit says. ""He did not offer Simone any help whatsoever.""

Griffith refused to get up, told him she wasn't doing anything wrong and yelled rude things at him, according to the suit.

Rodriguez called for backup and told Griffith three more times to get up, her arrest documents say. Then another officer -- also only identified by his surname, Escamilla -- arrived.

""Having spent 180 entire seconds futilely repeating the same commands, Rodriguez decided to arrest Simone because Rodriguez and Escamilla knew of no other approach to communicating with a frightened human being,"" the lawsuit says.

Escamilla and Rodriguez tried to handcuff Griffith. She pulled back and ""proceeded to strike/scratch my face with her right hand and was screaming belligerently,"" arrest records say. ""Officer Escamilla and I proceeded to tell (Griffith) not to resist, but she kept fighting back. (She) began kicking me as I was trying to gain control of her hands/arms to place handcuffs on her.""

What happened next was captured by a bystander and shared with KXAN-TV.

The officers first trapped Griffith up against the building, then dragged her off the curb, the video shows. One officer kneed Griffith in her side, then punched her eight times.

Austin police policy allows officers to punch people during an arrest only if the person is resisting arrest and if the force is reasonable.

Prosecutors later dropped the criminal trespass charge against Griffith, Webber said.

The Austin Police Department said in a statement that it is reviewing the officers' actions.

""Anytime a police officer uses force, the incident deserves to be scrutinized,"" the statement says. ""APD has a robust force review process. This process starts with the on-scene supervisor and ends with a review by the Force Review Unit and the officers' chain of command.

""When Simone is lucid, she remembers her past traumas and understands how susceptible she is to further mistreatment and abuse.

While best known for consumer electronics devices like the PlayStation game console, Sony soon may start building electric vehicles, as well, or so suggested the company's top executive during a presentation Tuesday at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas.

The electronics giant has teased its interest in the auto industry during prior appearances at CES but, this time, Chairman, President and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida confirmed that Sony is setting up its own mobility unit. And to give show attendees an idea of what he has in mind, Yoshida pointed to a seven-seat, all-electric sport utility vehicle.

Referencing the response to a Sony SUV concept revealed two years ago, Yoshida said, ""The excitement we received after we showed off the (original) Vision-S really encouraged us to further consider how we can bring creativity and technology to change the experience of moving from one place to another.""

Sony, he added during Tuesday night's presentation, ""is well-positioned as a creative entertainment company to redefine mobility.""

Tesla has led the shift from internal combustion to battery power, selling nearly 1 million of its own electric vehicles last year. Startups like Rivian, Lucid and Fisker hope to echo that success.

But some non-traditional manufacturers also have shown interest in automotive manufacturing. Apple has been tinkering with the idea, on and off, for much of the past decade. It recently signaled it could be looking to bring out its own battery-electric vehicle by mid-decade. Foxconn, the Chinese company that assembles the iPhone, has also laid out plans to build BEVs, though it is more likely to repeat its role with Apple, serving as a contract manufacturer.

Then there's Dyson, the British company best known for its vacuums and hand dryers. It began developing a line of electric SUVs, even laying out manufacturing plans, before suddenly killing its multibillion-dollar program. Founder James Dyson said he didn't believe the company would be able to recoup its investment in an increasingly competitive EV market.

Getting into the car business isn't cheap, agreed Sam Abuelsamid, principal auto analyst with Guidehouse Insights. ""You can burn through a lot of cash very quickly.""

But Sony has plenty of cash to burn. The company has a market capitalization of nearly $160 billion, and around $31 billion in cash on hand.

It also has plenty of technology that could be used in a future battery-electric vehicle. The latest version of the Vision-S SUV debuted at CES on Tuesday ""has been developed on a foundation of safety, adaptability and entertainment,"" Yoshida explained.

""Safety has been our number-one priority in creating a comfortable mobility experience,"" he added. ""That has not changed when building this SUV. A total of 40 sensors are installed inside and outside of the vehicle to monitor safety.""

When revealing the earlier Vision-S Concept, Sony said it would feature autonomous driving capabilities. Many experts believe that, in a world of self-driving vehicles, travelers will want their cars, trucks and crossovers to offer just the sort of entertainment technologies Sony is known for.

Specific details have yet to be released, so it isn't clear how broad a line-up of vehicles Sony might envision or when it would enter the market. It did note that its products would carry the Sony brand, rather than follow the Foxconn model, producing vehicles under contract. The next step will come when a new subsidiary, Sony Mobility Inc., is established this coming spring.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-01/220105-sony-vision-car-mn-1030-2e0922.jpg",0.3803921568627451,eng-7384366,False,0.6745098233222961,0.3803921568627451,379093740,1

Lucid Group said on Tuesday it would expand into European markets in 2022, as demand for electric vehicles soar after several countries pledged to end dependence on fossil fuels for mobility.

""Expansion to European markets will begin this year. Stay tuned for country-specific delivery information,"" the California-based electric carmaker tweeted.

Reservations for the company's Lucid Air luxury sedan rose to 13,000 in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, reflecting an order book of about $1.3 billion and since then rose to beyond 17,000 when the company reported quarterly results in mid-November.

Lucid had said that it saw significant demand for the car as it ramps up production at their factory in Arizona and was confident of achieving 20,000 units in 2022.

Chief Executive Officer Peter Rawlinson had said in October 2021 that the launch of the Lucid Air sedan was set to happen in the Middle East and Europe in 2022 and China in 2023.

Last month, the company received a subpoena from the U.S. securities regulator seeking documents related to an investigation into its blank-check deal.

While some are still thinking about their New Year's resolutions, French businesses already have theirs mapped out for them -- by law.

Starting Jan. 1, measures from the anti-waste and circular economy law adopted by the French parliament in February 2020 kicked in.

Among them: the end of plastic wrapping around fresh produce, newspapers and magazines; the creation of public funds to support reuse, and -- most importantly for fashion and retail -- visible signage revealing the environmental impact of products as well as prohibiting the destruction of new, unsold nonfood merchandise on principle.

Despite ominous headlines and the threat of fines of up to 15,000 euros, this is a welcome step for many in the industry. ""If we are being completely lucid, there are a number of consumers for whom [environmental concerns] aren't a priority. Regulation makes certain that [no business] can ignore these issues, even when their consumer isn't prioritizing them,"" said Elizabeth Cazorla, general manager of BazarChic, the Galeries Lafayette Group-owned digital sales platform.

Beyond fashion goods themselves, the law's ramifications include rethinking the packaging to adhere to previous bans on single-use plastics, and sharing better information with consumers.

""It's a succession of challenging subjects -- not just because of costs but also in terms of feasibility. This will contribute to homogenizing practices across the board, making them legible and coherent for the consumer. And no one can say 'I don't have time or resources to handle this',"" Cazorla added.

""This law sends a clear signal, and [for brands] it speaks of common sense. Destroying is a mind-boggling, disgusting practice,"" said Pierre Mahéo, founder of French label Officine Générale. ""But destruction isn't the only aspect of waste. Resources are consumed at every step, so it's the entire chain that needs to be broken. It brings back key questions around purchasing, the rhythm of collections, production management and sustainable, rather than artificial, business growth.""

Although product destruction made for sensational headlines, it remains a marginal practice, according to Damien Pellé, corporate social responsibility director of the and BHV department stores.

""For a brand, destroying stock is an absolute failure, and makes no economic sense,"" he said, citing a recent study by the French Agency for Ecological Transition, or ADEME, that estimated the retail value of unsold fashion goods in 2019 at 1.7 billion euros, amounting to 4.1 percent of the industry's turnover.

Of those, only 5 percent ends up destroyed, with 23 percent sold through off-price circuits, 20 percent donated to charity and around 10 percent repaired or recycled. Still, that's between 10,000 and 20,000 tons -- the weight of two Eiffel Towers -- in new textile items ending up destroyed every year, according to another statistic from the ministry for ecological transition.

In fact, finding a destination for unsold merchandise isn't the biggest issue at hand. At Officine Générale, Mahéo has implemented a re-dyeing and customization program to extend the shelf life of seasonal styles and is about to open an outlet store for the brand.

""When possible, items are returned to suppliers, offered with a markdown, in clearance operations, or employee sales. What is left to the Secours Populaire, Dons Solidaires and Association Josephine charities,"" director of operations Laurence Gayraud wrote in an email.

At Galeries Lafayette, a voluntary policy was put in place in 2014 that saw 100,000 and 150,000 pieces donated between then and 2020, from its own brand and from labels the retailer purchased that did not sell within three years of entering the department store's inventory.

And donating isn't the only solution. ""The law doesn't say you have to do that, it just forbids destruction,"" Pellé said, noting that premium and luxury brands could opt for upcycling or recycling in a bid to protect their brand equity. ""What is needed is massive investment in the development of new technologies that allow recycling and reuse of materials, because that's where we are lacking in viable solutions.""

Those are still in the works, with the emergence of actors such as ReValorem, a Paris-based company that recovers and recycles unsold items and raw materials for the luxury goods industry, and fashion tech start-up Tekyn, which won the innovation prize at the 2020 ANDAM fashion prize for its on-demand production solutions.

Other players -- like resale platform Vestiaire Collective -- are also working on ideas such as ""resale as a service,"" or RaaS, or the implementation of digital IDs for garments, which would allow for more transparency -- and authenticity tracing.

""This new application of the anti-waste law comes at a critical time, and will 100 percent revitalize the circular economy in fashion,"" said Vestiaire's chief and inclusion officer Dounia Wone, noting that the European regulation intending to give clothes a rating similar to the one given to household appliances heralded an exciting time for pre-loved and vintage fashion.

That's an opinion shared by Pellé, who called the environmental scoring system a potential game-changer. Inspired by the nutritional and energy-efficiency scores, it will grade the environmental qualities of a product on an easy-to-read scale of A to E. ""What will change in 2022 is that they [consumers] get the keys as objective as possible to understanding the choices they make when buying garments or fashion items, information they have been demanding according to polls and studies.""

According to Pellé, a unified official notation system -- be it within France or at the European level -- would also work toward restoring consumers' trust at a time where ""there is mistrust and suspicion because they see much of the [ecological messaging] as marketing and communication ploys.""

But ""two years [since the law was voted] is a very short time to meet all the legal requirements, especially since the decree that should have come into effect on Jan. 1 has still not been published,"" noted Pierre-François Le Louët, president of 's women's ready-to-wear federation.

Another pain point brands, institutions and retailers agreed on is the environmental impact notation system, or rather, the criteria that underpin this consumer-facing indicator that was made mandatory by France's 2022 measures and by the 2021 Climate and Resilience law voted into effect last summer.

""It's not something you can throw together in a few days. The information can be difficult to identify, and claims aren't easy to back up with proof [at this stage],"" Cazorla explained.

Several methods are being considered and the French government has given the industry a six-month test period to come up with suitable proposals. And this might be the biggest challenge of the year.

Take the Product Environmental Footprint and its life cycle analysis, the method favored by the European Commission. ""But that doesn't cover biodiversity, microplastic or organic agriculture, relying too much on hypotheses rather than tests or audits,"" said Philippe Schiesser, who founded eco-design consultancy firm Ecoeff Lab.

He is working on the EcoDesign Score, an evaluation method that takes on board product durability and eco-design practices. Supported by all of the industry's federations and the DEFI, France's commission for the promotion of textiles and apparel, it relies on ISO norms, in hopes to take root at a global level. In the medium term, a successful trial could lead to the score being adopted across Europe, especially given France's presidency of the European Union for the first six months of 2022.

""We have to see beyond the French or even European context. There is no sense in creating a system for one territory only, because for better or for worse, the industry is global,"" said Schiesser.","{'uri': 'wwd.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'WWD'}","[{'uri': 'lily_templeton@wwd.com', 'name': 'Lily Templeton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GL_Go-for-Good_11_BD.jpg?w=1024,0.1294117647058823,,False,0,0.1294117647058823,379092240,1

Daimler has released details of a concept electric vehicle which uses solar technology and bio-based materials, with the German automotive giant saying it has a range of over 1,000 kilometers (around 621 miles) on one charge.

The Vision EQXX has 117 roof-based solar cells -- the idea is that they can help to boost the car's range -- while the vehicle's interior incorporates materials including a leather alternative called Mylo.

Mylo is produced using mycelium, which Daimler described as being ""the underground rootlike structure of mushrooms.""

""It is certified bio-based, which means it is made predominantly from renewable ingredients found in nature,"" Daimler said. Other materials used in the car include a ""cactus-based biomaterial"" called Deserttex and carpets made from bamboo fiber.

In a statement issued Monday, Markus Schafer, Daimler's chief technology officer responsible for development and procurement, said that the technology program behind the concept vehicle would ""define and enable future Mercedes-Benz models and features.""

Schafer had previously announced details of the vehicle's range in a LinkedIn post toward the end of last year. On Monday, Daimler said the range figures were ""preliminary and based on digital simulations in real-life traffic conditions.""

If an electric vehicle were able to travel over 621 miles on a single charge in real-world conditions, it would help dispel concerns about range anxiety. The term refers to the idea that EVs aren't able to undertake long journeys without losing power and getting stranded.

As technology develops, the range of electric vehicles is starting to grow. Tesla says its Model S Plaid has an estimated range of 396 miles, while Lucid has said the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range has ""an official EPA rating of 520 miles of range.""

The Vision EQXX represents the latest example of how car companies are looking to use different materials in their vehicles.

In September, Volvo Cars announced it wanted all the models it sells to be leather-free by 2030. The Swedish firm also said it wanted a quarter of the material used in its new cars to ""consist of recycled and bio-based content"" by 2025.

In 2019, Elon Musk's Tesla said the interior of its Model 3 was ""100% leather-free."" Elsewhere Porsche -- a brand owned by the Volkswagen Group -- offers customers a leather-free option for the interior of the all-electric Taycan.

In an interview with CNBC's Annette Weisbach aired on Tuesday, Daimler's Schafer sought to paint a picture of how supply chains would change in the years ahead as technologies developed.

""If you look at this car here [the Vision EQXX], what does the new car need? It needs software, it needs chips, and needs battery.""

""And lots of these items are new items ... they were not needed in the past, so the purchasing team, logistic teams, they need a new focus,"" he said.

""So we're entering into the supply chain much more than we did in the past, looking at raw materials for [the] battery, looking at semiconductors, where they are produced.""

He was also asked if Europe should do more to produce and secure the commodities and semiconductors required for the car industry, as well as others.

""Yeah, I believe absolutely Europe should do that,"" he said. ""Right now we depend very much on other parts of the world and we should ... change that.""

""So we need to focus our investments in Europe on semiconductor production, we need to look at raw materials for battery cells.""","{'uri': 'nbclosangeles.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC Southern California'}",[],https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2022/01/106996950-1641391115146-Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-85623-AM.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,0.1450980392156862,,True,0,0.1450980392156862,379091820,3

It's only been a few days into the 2022 investing year. And already, Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) record-high Q4 2021 and full-year production numbers are all the buzz on Wall Street.

On Monday alone, share prices of Tesla gained $143 a share or 14%, catapulting the stock within just a few percentage points of an all-time high. Not only did Tesla's results beat expectations, but they came during a challenging global chip shortage that beleaguered the auto industry throughout 2021.

Despite the impressive performance, there's reason to believe that Tesla's $144 billion market cap gain on Monday was a bit too much. With a market cap that now stands at a whopping $1.2 trillion, investors are paying a premium for Tesla's future. The same goes for Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) and Nio (NYSE:NIO). Here's what makes these two electric car stocks better buys now, even though all three are expensive.

Daniel Foelber (Lucid): Lucid has done investors a favor by setting expectations for 2022. Flush with cash after its merger with Churchill Capital IV and a recent senior note offering, Lucid has over $6 billion in cash that should help propel its production and chart a path toward its first full year as a viable electric vehicle (EV) automaker.

2021 was a banner year for Lucid that proved the company's mettle when it comes to technology, engineering, and design. Yet those qualities pale in comparison to the importance of mass production, a skill Tesla knows too well is much easier said than done.

Lucid plans to produce and deliver 20,000 Lucid Airs in 2022. It has already ceased reservations for its Dream Edition sedan and is focused on rolling out its Grand Touring, Touring, and Air trims in 2022, as well as making progress on its Gravity SUV.

Lucid will probably get a pass on its financial figures in 2022, seeing as it's given every inclination that it won't generate sizable revenue, let alone profit, for a few more years. However, all eyes will be on Lucid's reservations, which currently stand at 17,000, as well as its success in developing and delivering all four trims of the Lucid Air on time and without complications. Doing that would support the investment thesis and chart a path toward long-term growth.

Howard Smith (Nio): While Tesla is currently the clear leader in EV sales, investors may want to look at stocks of smaller EV makers to buy before their businesses mature. Nio is already established and has an opportunity to grow in two substantial markets. While it's off of a much smaller base, Nio's 2021 deliveries increased by 109% versus Tesla's 87% year-over-year growth.

2022 is setting up to be a pivotal year for Nio in several ways. It has been growing its vehicle deliveries over the past two years, as can be seen in the following chart.

2022 brings expanded production capacity, new vehicle offerings, and a further move into Europe. Nio, along with its state-owned manufacturing partner, is working on doubling production capacity to at least 20,000 electric vehicles per month. That work is scheduled to be completed this spring. As seen above, that would also amount to an approximate doubling of recent monthly delivery volumes.

Nio began sales in Norway last year and has established a full operation there, including Nio community gathering places, and it plans for charging and battery swap infrastructure. The company now plans to expand into Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark in 2022.

Nio also has said it will launch three new products in 2022. Two have already been announced with the ET7 luxury sedan and the smaller ET5. The company plans to begin delivering the ET7 in March 2022 and the ET5 by September. It is also potentially working on a partnership with China's largest automaker, BYD, to develop a sub-brand with mass-market appeal, according to industry follower CnEVPost.

2022 will undoubtedly be an important year for Nio. Investors that feel like they've missed out on the production ramp-up from Tesla might want to look at Nio shares as that company looks to accelerate its own growth this year.

Tesla's numbers deserve praise, as the company has gone from streaky profitability and production snags to a well-charged machine. However, Tesla's production is still a lot less than the legacy automakers. And companies like Lucid and Nio are showing signs that they can grow quickly too.

The EV landscape has changed, and Tesla is just the tip of the EV iceberg. With so many options out there, investors can pick and choose which companies pique their interest and match their risk tolerance.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'howard_smith@fool.com', 'name': 'Howard Smith', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'daniel_foelber@fool.com', 'name': 'Daniel Foelber', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659845/1-blue-tesla-model-y.jpeg,0.2627450980392156,eng-7382837,False,0.7215686440467834,0.2627450980392156,379091460,17

Sometimes what the market gives, the market takes away. At least that's how the last two months have gone for shares of Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID). Lucid stock got hammered in December, dropping 28.2% for the month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. But back up one more month and the return over the past two months is a less exciting 2.9% move higher.

November was a big month for both Lucid the stock and Lucid the company. But after that excitement wore off, investors took profits over the last four weeks. Lucid wasn't the only electric vehicle (EV) name to take a hit in the month of December.

But after Lucid stock soared more than 43% in the prior month, it experienced one of the larger corrections in December.

Several things occurred to drive shares higher before the December drop. Lucid delivered its much-anticipated first vehicles on Oct. 30, 2021. The Lucid Air was also given MotorTrend's 2022 Car of the Year award soon after its initial commercial deliveries. Lucid was also able to highlight its in-house technology advantage with a certified battery range of up to 520 miles, giving investors more reason to buy in.

But in December, Lucid spooked investors when it announced it was raising more capital. With $4.8 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, 2021, the company presumably was capitalized well enough to satisfy its growth plans through at least 2022. So the debt offering came as somewhat of a surprise, and likely contributed to the month's downward move in shares.

The company also revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a subpoena to the company related to unspecified projections and statements related to the company's public debut through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger last year.

While it remains unclear whether the SEC investigation will amount to anything substantive, it's an added risk and investors don't like uncertainty. The capital raise, however, gives the company about $7 billion to help drive growth going forward. The macro picture involved a drop for the entire EV sector. But some of that negative sentiment has already reversed course. Lucid shares had jumped as much as 7.5% to start January before paring about half of that jump.

December proved that it doesn't take much to see large swings in the stock of Lucid and other EV companies. It's a good reminder to investors in the sector that they should expect volatile share prices.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'howard_smith@fool.com', 'name': 'Howard Smith', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659911/lucid-air-gallery-012.jpg,0.2470588235294118,eng-7381244,False,0.7764706015586853,0.2470588235294118,379091460,19

Car dealerships are a vestige of the 20th century which -- like many outmoded and counterproductive industries -- is being kept alive by political machinations. Tesla never wanted anything to do with the dealership model, and neither do any of the 21st-century auto startups. One suspects that many legacy automakers would also like to dispense with it if they could.

Dealerships add an additional layer of cost and inconvenience to the car-buying process (what Tom Friedman calls ""friction""), in order to provide services that were once important, but are no longer needed in the internet age. And while many auto salespeople are surely dedicated and skilled workers, because of their commission-based compensation structure, over the decades the smarmy, high-pressure car salesman (in a cheap suit) has become a stock character in popular culture -- mistrusted and unloved.

Now another reason has emerged to hate on the poor, misunderstood dealerships -- they're taking advantage of the ongoing supply crunch to jack up prices.

As fate would have it, the recent surge in demand for electric vehicles has coincided with the pandemic-induced supply-chain disruptions that are causing shortages of many products. At the same time, legacy automakers have, as always, chosen to produce their EVs only in limited numbers. The result is that supply is lagging far behind demand -- if you want to buy a new EV, be prepared to put your name on a waiting list. Tesla has been dealing with this problem (or opportunity) for most of its existence, but now buyers are reporting that long waits are the norm for several current and upcoming models (electric and gas).

One of the hottest EVs in the pipeline is the Ford F-150 Lightning -- Ford claims to have over 200,000 reservations for the electric pickup truck, and it's currently planning to build only 15,000 units in 2022. The automaker says it has already increased planned production numbers twice, but at this rate, a car buyer who wants some Lightning could be looking at a wait of two years or more. Several Ford dealerships have been asking reservation-holders to pony up huge markups in order to convert their reservations to firm orders. One reportedly tacked on 30 grand.

A group of posters in the ElectricVehicles subreddit has created a handy spreadsheet to document dealership markups for various EV models around the country.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 and VW ID.4 are red-hot too, and some (not all) of their dealers are also taking advantage of the situation to demand premiums of up to $10,000 over MSRP. It's not just EVs that are getting marked up -- cars of all kinds are in short supply, and some dealers are reportedly slapping on ""market adjustment fees"" or ""administration fees"" across the board. Another little trick is insisting that the buyer pony up for unwanted add-ons like a ""dealer protection package."" (What do the dealers need to be protected from, exactly?)

Of course, supply and demand is the law of the land -- when things get scarce, they get expensive -- so who can really blame the dealerships? These are new, upscale cars we're talking about, not loaves of bread. But the situation does make one wonder whether consumers might get a better shake if they could deal directly with automakers.

Of course, Tesla isn't exactly the white knight in this fable -- facing high demand and constrained supply, it's been raising prices for its new models for months, long before the current supply crunch developed (Tesla always seems to be a step or two ahead of the legacy automakers). However, at least the prices are there in black and white on the website, so there's less leeway for sales shenanigans. (On the other hand, we have heard from buyers who claim that Tesla doesn't always live up to its claims of price transparency.)

The best story we've heard (via InsideEVs) concerns someone who had placed an order for a Mercedes-Benz EQS 580, which has a starting MSRP of $119,110. The dealership insisted on a $50,000 markup before it would confirm the order. The would-be buyer complained to Mercedes-Benz USA, only to be told that ""pricing is completely up to the dealer.""

""Infer what you will about the dealer model protecting consumers,"" wrote the erstwhile Mercedes fan. Did he swallow his irritation and hand over the extra 50 grand? Or abandon his plan to buy a new car? No, readers -- he bought himself a Lucid Air instead.

After announcing an NEDC range of 1,000 km this past November, GAC Aion has now shared a slightly longer range alongside other specs for Chinese consumers, including pricing.

Aion is an all-electric marque of Guangzhou Automobile Corporation (GAC) Group. Currently, the automaker sells five electric SUVs and sedans not including its new electric SUV. This does include a standard version of the LX that debuted in 2019.

When GAC unveiled its Aion V Plus SUV in 2021 as an upgraded version of the V with a faster charging battery, it promised 1,000 km of range. However, GAC's website shows range options of 500, 600, and 702 km of NEDC range.

This past November, GAC Aion announced its latest revamp would be coming to the LX SUV. At the time, we learned the LX Plus would feature Aion's previously showcased charging capabilities alongside an extended range of 1,000 km - all within the same size battery pack as the current LX model.

Still some details such as pricing were not revealed. Now, as GAC Aion looks to begin official sales of the LX Plus SUV in China, we have a better idea of the impressive specs and MSRPs consumers can expect.

Top-tier GAC Aion SUV arrives with 144.4 kWh battery, 1,008 km range

The news of sales opening was pointed out by CnEVPost, who also shared some details from GAC Aion regarding its new SUV. The company stated that the 144.4 kWh pack has an energy density of 205 Wh/kg, claiming the LX Plus is ""the world's longest-range production vehicle.""

The top-tier version of the new electric SUV will feature the energy-dense pack, which promises an NEDC range of over 1,000 km. As you can see from the chart above, it is also the only option to feature a sponge silicon anode.

What may be more interesting is that GAC Aion is promising this range and energy density from a standard ternary pack rather than a solid-state battery, probably a reason for its large size. Regardless, that sort of range is an impressive feat, although it's rated by a less strict NEDC compared to the EPA for instance.

The 1,008 km version of the LX Plus will start at an MSRP of RMB 459,600 ($~72,300), and is available for sale and test drives in China now.

Electrek's Take

I'd be interested to see what this SUV's range comes out to from another driving cycle that isn't the NEDC. I'd guess it's a lot shorter range than 1,008 km, but even so, GAC Aion is making moves overseas.

I'm sure the 144.4 kWh battery pack helps, but achieving energy density in the same battery footprint as its predecessor should be recognized, especially since it's not using solid-state technology like some of its Chinese competitors are promising.

This is also a crossover SUV too, not a sedan. Another factor to recognize. Regardless of how real the NEDC range is, and the fact that GAC Aion has shared zero intentions of expanding to other markets, this is a noteworthy story because it's yet another Chinese automaker pushing the limits of EV range technology.

Lucid has delivered 520 miles of EPA range in the US, but it will cost you $100,000 more than this SUV from GAC Aion. What I'm getting at is this - EV battery technology is developing handsomely all over the world, especially in China. The LX Plus, alongside EVs from NIO, XPeng, Lucid, and yes, even Tesla are all reaching new battery feats in energy density, safety, and performance.

It's only a matter of time before these technologies become common in EVs, making them less expensive for consumers, and that's exciting for the prospect of EV adoption.

That response accentuates the faith investors have in Japan's second-biggest company to deliver on something when it puts its mind to it.

And it is particularly pertinent given how crowded the electric vehicle market is becoming.

That market is already dominated by Tesla, which currently accounts for more than one in six electric vehicles sold worldwide, while all of the globe's biggest established carmakers - Volkswagen, Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Daimler, BMW and Honda - are ploughing billions into electrification.

So, too, are SAIC and BYD, two of China's biggest carmakers, which are respectively the third and fourth largest players (behind Tesla and Volkswagen) in the global electric vehicle market.

To them can be added Rivian, the electric vehicle start-up backed by Amazon and Ford, whose stock market valuation overtook that of Volkswagen and Toyota when it came to the stock market in November last year.

There is Polestar, the luxury electric vehicles maker backed by Volvo Cars of Sweden and Geely Automotive of China and Lucid, the luxury electric vehicle maker run by the former Tesla executive Peter Rawlinson. Then there is Nio, a Chinese electric vehicle specialist whose stock market valuation already exceeds the likes of Honda, while it is also an open secret that Apple is working on various electric vehicle projects.

So, despite Sony's established excellence in consumer electronics and entertainment, there is no guarantee it will be able to crack the electric vehicle market.

But judging from the company's comments at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas - the global technology sector's biggest annual get-together - Sony is clearly thinking hard about it.

Unveiling a prototype electric SUV, named the Vision-S02, Kenichiro Yoshida, Sony's chief executive, said the company had been encouraged by a positive response to an earlier prototype, Vision-S01, unveiled two years ago.

He said: ""The excitement we received after the announcement... encouraged us to further consider how we can bring creativity and technology to change the experience of moving from one place to another.""

His comments suggest Sony is contemplating launching a car under its own brand name. When it unveiled its earlier prototype, it was with the specific aim of showcasing its sensor technology, which it had been looking at selling to other carmakers and particularly those looking to launch autonomous vehicles.

Investors are also hopeful that Sony, unlike some other entrants to the electric vehicle market, will be able to succeed because of its existing strengths in the consumer electronics market and in fields such as artificial intelligence and robotics.

It set up a subsidiary called Sony AI in April 2020 and has built an AI-powered robot dog, Aibo, which has been involved in the EV project. The prototype unveiled in Las Vegas also showcased the company's existing electronics products, including a fully integrated digital video service called Bravia Core for Vision-S, which promises shared or individual video playback on the front panoramic screen and individual rear-seat displays. The car would also allow passengers to play PlayStation games through a remote connection to a console at home or play streaming games through the cloud.

Mr Yoshida added: ""We believe Sony is well-positioned as a creative entertainment company to redefine mobility.""

Those comments, however, will confirm to some Sony-watchers that the company is merely looking into electric vehicles as a way of showcasing its existing entertainment products - a music and computer games provider on wheels.

Nonetheless, news of the new division, to be called Sony Mobility, comes at a time when the company has its tail up. Sony shares have risen by 50% during the last year, dramatically outperforming the Nikkei 225 index, which has only risen by 8% during the same period. Its shares have also outperformed those of sector peers such as Canon, Panasonic and Nintendo during the last 12 months.

Recent optimism has been driven by Sony's entertainment businesses which, traditionally, were regarded internally in a business dominated by engineers as playing second fiddle to consumer electronics.

But the company has made a much better fist in recent years of explaining to investors the merit of a business bringing together both hardware and content, as typified by PlayStation, the world's best-selling games console.

And those businesses have raised their performance. Sony Music Entertainment is, alongside Universal Music and Warner Music, one of the world's three biggest players in recorded music - a sector that is thriving thanks to the boom in music streaming. So, too, is Sony/ATV, the world's biggest music publishing business, whose worth has been reappraised by investors at a time when there is a boom in the value of song catalogues.

Sony, whose catalogue already includes hits by the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, has been an active player in the consolidation taking place in the sector, as shown just before Christmas, when it paid a reported $500m for Bruce Springsteen's entire recorded music and songwriting catalogues.

Meanwhile Sony Pictures, which was bought by Sony 32 years ago when it was still known as Columbia Pictures, also has wind in its sails. One of the big five Hollywood studios, it is currently celebrating the most successful post-pandemic film launch in Spider-Man: No Way Home, which is already one of the 10 biggest-grossing films of all time in the US.

So this is a company not lacking in confidence and it will have some advantages if it does move into electric vehicles under its own steam. The most obvious of these, as with Tesla, is that it will be starting from scratch. It will not, unlike the likes of Ford and Volkswagen, have a legacy internal combustion business to protect in the short-term. Another is that, with its expertise in consumer electronics, it will be well-placed to compete in a product that includes more software and fewer moving parts than conventional cars.

Yet the decision by Dyson in October 2019 to discontinue its interest in electric vehicles shows that even companies with an impeccable record for electronic products and an expertise in technology can find this particular market a tough one. There is still plenty of scope for disappointment.","{'uri': 'news.sky.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Sky News'}",[],https://e3.365dm.com/22/01/1600x900/skynews-sony-electric-car_5633319.jpg?20220105144251,0.2156862745098038,eng-7384366,False,0.5960784554481506,0.2156862745098038,379091160,1

Concerns over range anxiety have been well documented among prospective electric vehicle owners. Cases of range excess? Those are more difficult to find.

On the way home from a road trip designed to test the range limits of a prototype battery, that's exactly what an engineering team from Michigan startup Our Next Energy Inc. encountered.

After starting the day in the Detroit suburb of Novi, on the morning of Dec. 17, the team traveled north in a Tesla Model S retrofitted with their own battery. They drove north for hours, finally turning around at the Cut River Bridge in the state's Upper Peninsula. Gradually on the return, they realized that depleting the battery would take longer than anticipated.

""On the way back, we realized we were going to need to burn more energy off, so we decided to go to Lansing, and then after Lansing, we knew we still needed to burn more energy off,"" CEO Mujeeb Ijaz, along for the ride in a chase vehicle, tells Automotive News. ""So we went to Ann Arbor, and then we went to Detroit, and finally, we were like, 'Let's just go back home.' ""

By the time they got home at 2 a.m., they had traveled 752 miles on their proof-of-concept battery without recharging. The real-world test occurred at an average speed of 55 mph, and in temperatures that reached a high of 41 degrees Fahrenheit in southeast Michigan and while enduring occasional windy conditions.

That mileage roughly doubles the range of electric vehicles on the market today. Depending on its configuration, the Tesla Model S achieves between 348 and 405 miles, per the latest stated figures from the EPA. The Chevrolet Bolt reaches 259 miles in range, per the EPA. The Lucid Air has surpassed all of them with a range as high as 520 miles, albeit at a sticker price that starts at $77,400 and reaches as high as $169,000.

Battling range anxiety

For Ijaz, the results of the sprawling road trip signaled that Our Next Energy had reached an important moment in developing a range-extending battery that may one day ease consumer anxiety about range in EVs.

""One of the early goals we set out to accomplish a forward agenda on is to get more range to electric vehicles, because we really believe that range and adoption are linked together,"" Ijaz said. ""The problem in electric vehicles today is that we're promising people a certain amount of range, but then the vehicles are not living up to that in the real world. So what we decided to do is go after doubling the amount of energy we could put on board.""

A third-party company validated the results, according to Our Next Energy, placing the same vehicle on a dynamometer. It achieved a range of 882 miles at 55 mph.

Our Next Energy, which was founded in July 2020, has addressed that challenge with a hybrid battery approach. Engineers have created a workhorse battery intended to handle daily driving and withstand frequent charging. A second battery with a different chemistry will stretch the range for the occasional long trips.

The first battery, called Aries, is designed for durability and scheduled to enter production by the end of this year. The second, called Gemini, is the proof of concept that Our Next Energy tested in its ride around Michigan. The road trip test results will help evolve the battery toward production, though Ijaz says R&D efforts remain ongoing.

In particular, the prototype Gemini battery contained cobalt. Ijaz is adamant about avoiding cobalt in his finished product, because of supply, price and range considerations.

""First and foremost, we want a new material set,"" he said. ""Let's focus on materials that are responsible, that are sustainable and able to be mined anywhere in the world, that are not geographically constrained.""

Our Next Energy closed a series A round in October, receiving $25 million from investors that included Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate-focused venture capital fund started by Bill Gates. Others participating in the round included BMW i Ventures, Flex Ltd., Volta Energy Technologies and Detroit-based VC fund Assembly Ventures.

Breakthrough effort?

Ijaz, a veteran of Ford Motor Co., Apple and A123 Systems, said the landmark road trip was a memorable moment. Not necessarily because of the final range achieved, but because of the view he got on the road.

At one point, the gasoline-powered chase vehicle from which he observed the test needed to exit the interstate and refuel. The electric car powered by his battery needed no such break.

""Watching that whole thing unfold was one of the highlights of my career,"" he said. ""That vehicle just kind of kept on going, day and night. I think that's a pretty remarkable thing.""","{'uri': 'autonews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Automotive News'}","[{'uri': 'pete_bigelow@autonews.com', 'name': 'Pete Bigelow', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/Gemini-MAIN_i.jpg,0.06666666666666665,eng-7379460,False,0.658823549747467,0.06666666666666665,379090500,1

Imagine an electric car that covers 752 miles on a single charge. You can't buy it today, but a modified Tesla Model S drove that distance across Michigan last month. It was the work of a two-year-old Michigan startup, Our Next Energy (ONE), which says it is aiming to make safer and more sustainable batteries. ONE retrofitted the car with a battery holding twice the energy of Tesla's original -- while fitting entirely within the same space. It's a proof of concept for the company's own future battery design.

Two ways exist to assuage range anxiety among EV buyers. The first is ubiquitous, reliable, nationwide DC fast charging, like Tesla's Supercharger network. Unfortunately, only Tesla offers that today. Every other EV relies on a mishmash of private networks of varying reliabilities.

The second is to improve the range of EVs by a combination of large-capacity batteries and improving their efficiency. That's the approach used by the Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX, an ultra-efficient concept EV that was just unveiled Monday. Its goal is to provide 620 miles of range in a luxury sedan.

ONE's project didn't mess with anything to alter the Model S's efficiency, but employed a much higher-capacity battery. ""We want to accelerate the adoption of EVs by eliminating range anxiety, which holds back consumers today,"" said ONE founder and CEO Mujeeb Ijaz. He's a battery engineer with more than 30 years' experience, including stints at Apple, A123 Systems, Ford, and others.

ONE put its higher-capacity prototype pack into a Tesla Model S Long Range Plus, providing nearly 90 percent more range than its original 402-mile EPA figure. The demonstration car is actually the same vehicle (before ONE modified it) that won our EV 1000 long-range trip last spring. In our own highway range test last May, that car achieved 320 miles at a steady 75 mph, the farthest distance we've recorded. (That model has since been supplanted by the Model S Long Range, rated at 405 miles.)

The original Tesla battery had a capacity of 103.9 kilowatt-hours, while the prototype ONE battery that replaced it in the same space has 207.3 kWh. CEO Ijaz confirmed to C/D that ONE used ""a single pack retrofitted in the same space as the original battery."" So it's far more energy-dense, but delivered consumption (in miles per kWh) roughly equal to that of the original battery.

ONE's drive took place in mid-December in Michigan -- with chilly winter temperatures working against range maximization -- where the company drove up and down the length of the mitten state for nearly 14 hours, averaging 55 mph, before winding up back at its Novi headquarters in southeastern Michigan with the trip odometer showing 752.2 miles. Later, in a much less taxing test, the company put the Model S on a dynamometer at a steady 55 mph, where it ran for a staggering 882 miles on a charge.

The company dubs its prototype a proof of concept. The point is to show that real-world ranges far longer than an average driver's endurance (pit stops, ahem) can be achieved in the near future. The next step is for it to evolve into a new battery called Gemini, intended to go into production after 2023.

ONE says it focuses on battery chemistries that are ""safer"" and ""sustainable,"" using a ""conflict-free supply chain."" In practice, that means lithium iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which historically has energy density 30 percent lower than cobalt- or nickel-based chemistries (and, unfortunately, reportedly cold-weather issues). Its first product, Aries, will go into production late this year. It's a battery using prismatic LFP cells in a structural cell-to-pack architecture without separate modules, packing more cells into the pack to lower the energy disadvantage against cobalt cells.

For Gemini, the company plans to supplement the lower-cost LFP cells with a range-extender portion of the battery for extreme power needs, to reduce stress and deterioration in the bulk of the pack. Range-extender cells will use an anode modified to eliminate graphite, which the company says ""makes more volume available for the cathode"" to boost the energy density of the range-extender cells.

The cathode will be made of a proprietary material rich in manganese that ONE says can be sustainably sourced at low cost. (The company has so far applied for 14 patents related to the Gemini pack.) The LFP cells cover 99 percent of the vehicle's duty cycle, Ijaz told C/D, and the range extender is used for just 1 percent.

As a proof of concept, however, the prototype pack used in the demonstration was powered by different cells. The capacity of more than 200 kilowatt-hours was provided by high-energy cobalt-nickel cells, while those intended for the Gemini line are still under development.

The point of this test, then, wasn't about ONE's future plans for new cells. Instead, it was to show that it's possible to pack considerably more energy into a battery the same size as today's -- without, for instance, double-stacking a pair of packs, as GM is doing in its 2022 GMC Hummer EV.

Headlines about EVs with 752 miles of range, or the EQXX's target of 620 miles, or the 520 miles of the 2022 Lucid Air version now being delivered, should go a long way to reassure nervous buyers. People will start to believe that EVs capable of very long ranges are possible -- even if they end up opting for a more affordable 300-mile alternative in the end.","{'uri': 'menshealth.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': ""Men's Health""}","[{'uri': 'john_voelcker@menshealth.com', 'name': 'John Voelcker', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gemini001-pressphotos-13-1641343977.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.831xh;0,0.169xh&resize=640:*",0.0980392156862746,eng-7379460,False,0.5960784554481506,0.0980392156862746,379090500,1

Lucid Air Dream Edition owners are poised to receive a rather feature-ridden over-the-air software update this month. As indicated in a message sent to Air owners from Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson, the company will be releasing several new driver-assist features for its DreamDrive system this January.

Lucid's debut luxury all-electric sedan, the $169,000 Air, was delivered with missing driver-assist features for its earliest customers. While the Air was equipped with DreamDrive features such as Surround View Monitoring, Rear-View Monitoring, Blind Spot Display, Blind Spot Warning, Distracted Driver Alert, Park Distance Warning, Automatic Park In, and Automatic Park Out, functions like Adaptive Cruise Control were unavailable.

According to a Bloomberg report, the missing DreamDrive features have resulted in some of the first Air owners complaining about their vehicles' missing functionality. This seemed to be referenced by Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson in his recent message to Air owners. Rawlinson noted that Lucid had received its customers' feedback, and it is working on releasing more of the luxury sedan's driver-assist functions.

""As the first owners of the Lucid Air Dream Edition, let me start by thanking you for the confidence you place in us. We are working tirelessly to help realize a more sustainable future, and could not do so without your support. We've received questions from many of you around DreamDrive and when additional features (beyond those already active in your Lucid Air) will be available. Many features are in the final stages of testing and are planned to be included in an over-the-air update in January,"" the message read.

As per the Lucid CEO's message, Lucid Air Dream Edition sedans would be receiving Adaptive Cruise Control with Speed Limit Assist, Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Protection, Front Cross Traffic Protection, Rear Cross Traffic Protection, Traffic Sign Recognition, and Traffic Drive-Off Alert with the upcoming January update. Additional DreamDrive features such as Highway Assist are planned to be released later this year.

Lucid has so far not issued a comment about the topic.

Lucid's DreamDrive is standard on all Air models, though a more robust iteration called DreamDrive Pro is standard for the Lucid Air Dream Edition and the Lucid Air Grand Touring. DreamDrive utilizes 32 different sensors, featuring 14 visible-light cameras, five radar units, four surround-view cameras, and numerous ultrasonic sensors. DreamDrive Pro adds LiDAR to the mix, allowing vehicles to perform more advanced maneuvers safely.

Blue Note embraced the 12"" LP format in 1955 by launching its famous 1500 series, which ran until 1958. It not only established the Big Apple label as the leading jazz record company of the time, but also introduced the world to hard bop, an offshoot of bebop that assimilated elements from blues and gospel music. On January 5, 1958, a 27-year-old Pennsylvania pianist named Conrad ""Sonny"" Clark recorded what many jazz disciples regard as a quintessential example of hard bop: Cool Struttin'.

Listen to Cool Struttin' on Apple Music and Spotify.

At that point, Clark's career seemed to be on the up, gathering an irresistible momentum. Just six months earlier, in June 1957, he had made his Blue Note debut as a sideman for saxophonist Hank Mobley, but he so impressed Blue Note's boss, producer Alfred Lion, that by the time he went into Rudy Van Gelder's Hackensack studio to cut Cool Struttin' he had already racked up three albums' worth of material for the label.

Cool Struttin' reunited Clark with bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Philly Joe Jones, of Miles Davis' band, both of whom had featured on the pianist's previous album, Sonny Clark Trio, recorded four months earlier. Clark also brought in trumpeter Art Farmer, whom he had known while living and working in California before he moved to New York. Farmer had shone on the pianist's memorable Blue Note debut, Dial ""S"" For Sonny, recorded in July 1957. Completing the two-horn frontline was altoist Jackie McLean, a native New Yorker the same age as Clark who was noted for his slightly harsh tone.

The album's opening title track, with its measured, slightly swaggering gait, slow-walking bass, and bluesy horn lines, is rightly regarded as Clark's signature tune. He takes the first solo, which is laconic and blues-infused, followed by some cool, lucid, soaring melodic lines by trumpeter Farmer. Jackie McLean's solo is more acerbic and down to earth and precedes a second piano solo, which mixes dissonance with fluid, horn-like lines. Bassist Paul Chambers also solos, using a bow, before returning to the slow-walking bass strut that leads to a reprise of the main horn theme.

Another Clark-penned tune, 'Blue Minor', follows. It's characterized by a head section comprised of rising horn lines punctuated by gospel chord cadences before the soloists shine over a propulsive groove driven by the impeccable engine room of Chambers and Jones.

The uptempo 'Sippin' At Bells' is an early Miles Davis tune that's mainly associated with bebop god Charlie Parker, one of Sonny Clark's musical heroes, whom the pianist met in Chicago in 1954. It begins with some electrifying drumming from Philly Joe Jones before Farmer's and McLean's combined horns announce the tune's snaking bop-style melody. Clark takes the first solo and, though he shows the influence of Bud Powell (the first jazz pianist to translate Charlie Parker's bebop style to the piano), he displays his own unique melodic concept.

Powell's influence can also be felt in the album's closer, 'Deep Night', a song first associated with - and co-written by - early jazz idol Rudy Vallée, who scored a big pop hit with it in 1929. Powell had taken the song and transformed it on his 1954 Norgran album Jazz Original. Evidently, Clark had heard Powell perform the song live at Birdland and was taken with it. ""When I heard Bud do it, I knew I'd have to play it too in my way,"" Clark told Nat Hentoff for the original Cool Struttin' liner notes. His version is driven by a propulsive sense of swing, thanks to the deftness of the powerful yet subtle playing by the Chambers-Jones rhythm section (Jones also gets to show his prowess with a short but explosive drum solo).

Cool Struttin' was released as BNLP 1588 in October 1958, housed in a memorable Reid Miles-designed front cover whose indelible image - depicting a woman's legs and stilettoed feet - embodied the assured urban vibe of the album's title track. Over six decades on, the album still exudes the hipness that came to epitomize the hard bop style that Blue Note perfected with their 1500 series.","{'uri': 'udiscovermusic.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'uDiscover Music'}","[{'uri': 'charles_waring@udiscovermusic.com', 'name': 'Charles Waring', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sonny-Clark-Cool-Struttin-album-cover-820.jpg,0.2470588235294118,,False,0,0.2470588235294118,379088700,1

In the race to try to catch Tesla when it comes to electric car supremacy, automakers are literally going the extra mile - at least when it comes to battery output.

With the auto industry having turned its full attention to the development of stylish long-range electric vehicles, car companies are looking to be able to boast about gains in how far their cars and SUVs can travel on a single charge as the way to separate themselves from the pack.

This week, Mercedes-Benz unveiled a concept vehicle for the CES tech trade show in Las Vegas that it says is capable of going up to 620 miles before it runs out of juice.

While Mercedes' Vision EQXX is only a prototype -- it's not clear when or if its technology can be transferred to a production vehicle -- it is surrounded by real-world competitors showing impressive gains in going the distance.

►No longer nerdy: Electric vehicles dominate our most anticipated cars, trucks list for 2022

The new electric Lucid Air luxury car has an estimated EPA range of up to 520 miles. The latest long-range version of Tesla's luxury Model S sedan can travel up to 406 miles. Ford Mustang Mach-E SUV can go up to 314 miles. And Mercedes' new EQS sedan can slide along the highway for up to 350 miles.

They are the kind of numbers automakers hope will light up indifferent buyers.

""They are trying to make a splash&mldr;They are trying to stand out,"" said Jessica Caldwell, director of insights for Edmunds.com. ""It's giving them that 'wow' factor.""

Despite all the attention they have received, electric cars remain only a blip on sales charts. But with a slew of new models on the way amid pressure from the government's fuel economy rules, there's hope the electric transportation future is finally taking shape.

Range isn't just a gimmick to entice motorists to trade gas pumps for power plugs. It helps allay car shoppers' fears that batteries will run dry on a long trip and leave them stranded miles from the nearest charging station.

Next comes the question of how much range is enough.

The first round of the industry's electric cars about a decade ago couldn't go much further than 80 to 100 miles depending on conditions. That was ""barely acceptable,"" said Ron Cogan, publisher of the Green Car Journal.

The jump to 200 miles of range made more sense and 300 miles ""takes away a lot of the range anxiety,"" Cogan said. But 600?

That's far enough to drive from Dallas to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Or Nashville to Pittsburgh. Or San Francisco to Las Vegas.

A range of 500 or 600 miles could allow people to be assured they can take their electric cars cross country and get to the destination even if a charging station is closed en route. While Tesla has created its high-speed Supercharger network, the nation's charging infrastructure isn't fully built out.

Six hundred miles of range could also allow motorists to skip charging along the way altogether, avoiding having to sit for an hour while their batteries gulp enough electrons to get them zipping along the highway again. They could charge in their own garages then not again until they reach their destination.

Think of driving from Dallas to Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Nashville to Pittsburgh or San Francisco to Las Vegas one day in the near-term future. Your batteries could make it nonstop even if your bladder can't.

Mercedes-Benz isn't alone in chasing the 600-mile dream. General Motors is after it too.

►The Daily Money: A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro, straight to your inbox.

Last year, the company unveiled a new generation of batteries packing 60 percent more energy and costing 40 percent less than the previous one. They would be good for up to 450 miles of driving per charge. It's the generation after that one that could produce 500 to 600 miles per charge with twice the battery energy density, announced Mei Cai, GM's Lab Group general manager.

Mercedes-Benz said it achieved a 600-mile range in the Vision EQXX through a raft of improvements, including improving the battery's chemistry, packing the cells tighter and moving electrical and electronic components to a separate compartment.

The car also has wind-cheating aerodynamics, roof panels that collect solar power and lightweight aluminum brakes.

""Electric range sounds easy but is a complex technical challenge,"" said Joerg Bartels, Mercedes vice president for vehicle engineering, in a statement. ""With Vision EQXX, we're presenting the results of an extraordinary challenge: we pushed efficiency to a totally new level.""

(ONE), a Michigan battery technology company, has demonstrated a proof-of-concept battery that powered an electric vehicle 752 miles without recharging. The vehicle completed a road test across Michigan in late December with an average speed of 55 mph. The results were validated by a third party using a vehicle dynamometer where the test vehicle, a Tesla Model S retrofitted with an experimental battery, achieved 882 miles at 55 mph.

""We want to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles by eliminating range anxiety, which holds back most consumers today,"" said Mujeeb Ijaz, Founder and CEO of ONE. ""We are now focused on evolving this proof-of-concept battery into a new product called Gemini™, which will enable long distance trips on a single charge while improving cost and safety using sustainable materials.""

Ijaz, a 30-year industry veteran, is a former senior executive at Apple and A123 Systems, where he led teams developing battery systems for electric vehicles.

Today's electric vehicles have lower adoption due to range limitations. Even the highest range electric vehicles sold today lack the surplus energy required to overcome factors such as high-speed driving, extreme weather, mountainous terrain, or towing trailers in real world conditions. These factors can lead to a loss of more than 35% of rated range, causing inconvenience and anxiety on road trips. ""The ONE Gemini battery aims to eliminate range as a barrier to electric vehicle adoption by doubling the available energy on board in the same package space,"" said Ijaz.

Until now, the industry approach to solving the range issue is to add more charging stations. However, relying on fast charge stations presents other obstacles, such as waiting in long lines, not recharging as fast as advertised, and being limited to a partial charge, which results in the need to stop every 150 miles.

ONE has designed its solution, the Gemini battery, to avoid this experience altogether by offering enough range for every consumer to make an electric vehicle their only vehicle.

Our Next Energy, Inc. (ONE) is a Michigan-based developer of innovative energy storage systems. Founded in 2020 by Mujeeb Ijaz, a battery systems engineer with more than 30 years of experience, the ONE engineering team are focused on safer battery chemistries that use sustainable raw materials while creating a reliable, low cost and conflict-free supply chain. ONE will begin production of its first product, Aries, in late 2022 and will demonstrate a production prototype Gemini battery in 2023.

""We plan to build (batteries) in North America, and believe it can be done economically,"" Ijaz said in an interview.

For ONE's Gemini battery, Ijaz said: ""We want to eliminate both nickel and cobalt, but we don't want to give up energy density. We aim to re-invent battery chemistry as well as the cell architecture"" in order to provide at least 750 miles of range between charges. ""If you put that much energy on board, you are ready for anything the customer asks - a round trip from Detroit to Chicago, or towing a trailer.""

ONE's range target is well beyond even the best of current electric vehicles, including the Lucid Air, which offers just over 500 miles of range in the top version.

Ijaz said ONE chose a Tesla Model S to showcase its prototype battery because ""it has fairly high efficiency and a fairly large battery pack"" which provided enough space to fit ONE's battery.

MacDailyNews Take: In December 2020, Reuters reported that one of the distinguishing characteristics of Apple's Project Titan (""Apple Car"") was ""next level"" battery technology. This would obviously be a tentpole feature.

So much for that - or can Apple deliver even more disruptive battery tech? Or will Apple (or some other company) acquire Our Next Energy, Inc.?

If this prototype can be scaled up, produced efficiently, and sell for a reasonable price, Ijaz is about to become very wealthy.","{'uri': 'macdailynews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MacDailyNews'}",[],https://149359564.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/220104_one_battery.png,0.04313725490196085,eng-7379460,False,0.8039215803146362,0.04313725490196085,379088220,1

Daimler has released details of a concept electric vehicle which uses solar technology and bio-based materials, with the German automotive giant saying it has a range of over 1,000 kilometers (around 621 miles) on one charge.

The Vision EQXX has 117 roof-based solar cells -- the idea is that they can help to boost the car's range -- while the vehicle's interior incorporates materials including a leather alternative called Mylo.

Mylo is produced using mycelium, which Daimler described as being ""the underground rootlike structure of mushrooms.""

""It is certified bio-based, which means it is made predominantly from renewable ingredients found in nature,"" Daimler said. Other materials used in the car include a ""cactus-based biomaterial"" called Deserttex and carpets made from bamboo fiber.

In a statement issued Monday, Markus Schafer, Daimler's chief technology officer responsible for development and procurement, said that the technology program behind the concept vehicle would ""define and enable future Mercedes-Benz models and features.""

Schafer had previously announced details of the vehicle's range in a LinkedIn post toward the end of last year. On Monday, Daimler said the range figures were ""preliminary and based on digital simulations in real-life traffic conditions.""

If an electric vehicle were able to travel over 621 miles on a single charge in real-world conditions, it would help dispel concerns about range anxiety. The term refers to the idea that EVs aren't able to undertake long journeys without losing power and getting stranded.

As technology develops, the range of electric vehicles is starting to grow. Tesla says its Model S Plaid has an estimated range of 396 miles, while Lucid has said the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range has ""an official EPA rating of 520 miles of range.""

The Vision EQXX represents the latest example of how car companies are looking to use different materials in their vehicles.

In September, Volvo Cars announced it wanted all the models it sells to be leather-free by 2030. The Swedish firm also said it wanted a quarter of the material used in its new cars to ""consist of recycled and bio-based content"" by 2025.

In 2019, Elon Musk's Tesla said the interior of its Model 3 was ""100% leather-free."" Elsewhere Porsche -- a brand owned by the Volkswagen Group -- offers customers a leather-free option for the interior of the all-electric Taycan.

In an interview with CNBC's Annette Weisbach aired on Tuesday, Daimler's Schafer sought to paint a picture of how supply chains would change in the years ahead as technologies developed.

""If you look at this car here [the Vision EQXX], what does the new car need? It needs software, it needs chips, and needs battery.""

""And lots of these items are new items ... they were not needed in the past, so the purchasing team, logistic teams, they need a new focus,"" he said.

""So we're entering into the supply chain much more than we did in the past, looking at raw materials for [the] battery, looking at semiconductors, where they are produced.""

He was also asked if Europe should do more to produce and secure the commodities and semiconductors required for the car industry, as well as others.

""Yeah, I believe absolutely Europe should do that,"" he said. ""Right now we depend very much on other parts of the world and we should ... change that.""

""So we need to focus our investments in Europe on semiconductor production, we need to look at raw materials for battery cells.""","{'uri': 'nbcchicago.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC Chicago'}",[],https://media.nbcchicago.com/2022/01/106996873-1641384245099-gettyimages-538225992-de411096a.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,0.1450980392156862,,False,0,0.1450980392156862,379086420,3

""Expansion to European markets will begin this year. Stay tuned for country-specific delivery information,"" the company tweeted in response.

Lucid did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for more information.

Lucid's first vehicle is called the Air sedan. It started delivering a $169,000 ""Dream Edition"" of the flagship car to customers in late October, following commercial production beginning a month earlier at a new factory in Casa Grande, Arizona. The car has an industry-leading range of 520 miles.

Like Tesla, Lucid is trying to develop autonomous driving technology that enables its cars to safely drive themselves.

Axel Schmidt, who heads up the automotive sector at consultancy firm Accenture, told CNBC Wednesday that tech companies have ""underestimated all the challenges"" when it comes to getting autonomous vehicles on the road.

He added that 60% to 70% of new cars will have ""Level 2"" autonomous driving capabilities by 2030. That means the cars will assist with steering, staying in the right lane and controlling speed but they won't be able to safely drive themselves until they reach ""Level 5.""

In January 2020, Lucid started taking online reservations in 15 European countries for its flagship Lucid Air sedan but the firm has not specified when the vehicles will be delivered.

Locations included Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The company, founded in 2007 and led by former Tesla executive Peter Rawlinson, went public through a SPAC deal in July that valued it at around $24 billion.

That month, it told investors that it expects to produce 20,000 Lucid Air sedans in 2022, generating more than $2.2 billion in revenue.

Four months later, Lucid's market value blew past Ford to $89.9 billion after executives told investors that reservations for its first vehicles had jumped and that its production plans for 2022 were still on track. At the time, it said it has more than 17,000 reservations for its Air sedan, up from 13,000 through the third quarter.

However, shares tanked around 20% last month when Lucid disclosed a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission likely into the company's SPAC deal to go public.

Lucid said although there is ""no assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter, the investigation appears to concern the business combination"" between the automaker and blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. IV.

Today, Lucid is valued at around $65 billion and its market cap is still far below Tesla, which surged to more than $1 trillion last year. Rivian, an EV start-up that went public in November, has a market cap of about $91 billion.","{'uri': 'nbcchicago.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC Chicago'}",[],https://media.nbcchicago.com/2021/10/106949031-16328667852021-09-28t213931z_1307921229_rc27zp9k9cej_rtrmadp_0_lucid-electric.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,0.1529411764705881,,True,0,0.1529411764705881,379086420,17

She still has the Silicon Valley mindset, after all: reality can be bent to your will. But what have we learned from the Theranos trial? Almost nothing.

Holmes was found guilty on four of 11 counts after about 50 hours of deliberation. Those counts could be grouped, roughly, into defrauding patients and defrauding investors. The jury found her not guilty of defrauding patients or conspiracy to defraud patients.

This is the result of decisions made by prosecutors who want to win. Patients testified for far less time than investors and spent a little more than an hour total on the stand. Prosecutors also didn't clearly tie the patients' Theranos tests to Holmes. In a way, this made sense: there were more intermediaries between Holmes and the individual patients. Besides the patients' individual doctors, there were also the personnel in the clinical lab, the lab directors, and so on. For the charges to stick, jurors had to believe Holmes had intended to defraud patients, not merely give them bad results.

When it came to the investors, prosecutors had Holmes dead to rights. Unlike with the patients, she was in the room. There were emails and recordings. Holmes' ties were clearer, and what she knew was clearer, too. The easiest part of this case to prove was about money, and that was where the prosecution spent the bulk of its time. Did Holmes lie to investors? The jury thought so on three counts, which represented a total of about $142 million from PFM Healthcare Master Fund, the DeVos family's Lakeshore Capital Management, and Daniel Mosley's Mosley Family Holdings. On three more investor counts, there was no verdict; a mistrial has been declared on those counts.

It has been curious to see Silicon Valley's reaction to the verdict: claiming Holmes wasn't really part of Silicon Valley at all, trial in San Jose notwithstanding. Theranos investors included Silicon Valley celebrities: Larry Ellison's Tako Ventures, Tim Draper's Draper Jurvetson Fischer, and Don Lucas, known for his early Oracle investment. ATA Ventures, a now-defunct fund that invested primarily in health software, and Crosslink Capital's Beta Bayview were also among the investors. Two founders of Silicon Valley investment firms also got in: Dixon Doll of DCM and Reid Dennis of IVP.

There are the cultural ties, too. Holmes appeared at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2014. While Andreessen Horowitz didn't invest, Marc Andreessen was a vocal cheerleader for Holmes -- even calling her the next Steve Jobs. From the extra-voting shares to the black turtlenecks, from Holmes' claims of sleeping at work to employees sleeping in their cars, the connection was there.

But the delusional optimism that Holmes' rise represented isn't limited to Silicon Valley -- at least, not anymore. It's spread widely. Elon Musk's success with Tesla kicked off a frenzy of electric vehicle SPACs, followed by a wave of fraud allegations. There's Nikola, whose founder Trevor Milton was indicted for fraud. Lordstown Motors is being frisked by the SEC for possibly misleading investors about preorders. Canoo, another recent SPAC, is also under investigation. So's Lucid Motors.

There's been a lot of talk about ""fake it til you make it"" as a founder credo, particularly in Alex Gibney's Theranos doc, The Inventor. You'd think this would make investors more likely to do their own technical due diligence, rather than relying on someone else's. But some venture capitalists told The Wall Street Journal early this year that they were spending less time on due diligence before investing -- the hot market makes it hard to compete.

That rush isn't just venture capital. Hedge funds and others have also moved into startups. One of the major sources of Thearnos' funding was family offices for notables such as Rupert Murdoch, Betsy DeVos, and the Walton family, of Walmart fame. In 2018, The Economist speculated that family offices controlled $3 trillion to $4 trillion in capital. Likely, that number is higher now.

Those investors received information packets that included Holmes' press appearances. Investors frequently testified about a 2013 article in The Wall Street Journal's opinion section that touted Theranos' tech as ""faster, cheaper and more accurate than the conventional methods."" That wasn't true. Investors also pointed to a 2014 Forbes article that said Theranos ""does not buy any analyzers from third parties,"" which wasn't true, either.

After Theranos, the tenor of Silicon Valley coverage changed, becoming more skeptical. Tech companies have at times objected to the increased scrutiny -- well, everyone is entitled to their opinions -- but in some ways, it makes sense. Investors aren't exactly motivated to expose wrongdoing, as it can tank their investment. Plus, it's embarrassing.

Nothing about the result of this trial is going to prevent the next Theranos from bilking investors because no one is punished when investors don't engage in due diligence. The onus is instead on the legal system -- and thus, the average taxpayer -- to get a guilty verdict in court. And because that's easier to prove than the behavior that's more likely to harm average people, that's where prosecutors will focus.

Because if we've learned anything, it's this: The startup founders exaggerating what their companies are capable of are the one who takes the fall, but only if they get caught red-handed, like Holmes did. Thankfully for investors -- and the startup hype cycle -- you don't go to jail for being a sucker.","{'uri': 'theverge.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Verge'}","[{'uri': 'elizabeth_lopatto@theverge.com', 'name': 'Elizabeth Lopatto', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_AAaMKaqiEkuJzOo890lgQa8muw=/0x0:4872x2436/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145751/1181871591.jpg,-0.1294117647058823,eng-7379670,False,0.6705882549285889,-0.1294117647058823,379086420,1

Up from the previous 163 mph, but there's room for more as Tesla has promised 200 mph.

When Tesla introduced the Model S Plaid last year, it touted an impressive top speed of 200 mph (322 km/h). However, you won't be able to go that fast since the EV is electronically governed at 163 mph (262 km/h). Those with the need for speed will be glad to hear a new software update loosens up the limiter to 175 mph (282 km/h), and while it's not the supercar-matching velocity we were promised, it's still an improvement.

Several new videos show a Model S Plaid with the latest OTA update, which comes along with a Track Mode. Mind you, the car will still be able to hit 175 mph even without the newly added mode selected. Per Tesla, the Track Mode turns off some driver assistance systems and should be used only on a track to ""experience the unmatched performance at many different venues.""

What does Track Mode do? According to the release notes, it boosts powertrain performance after dialing up the heat pump to cool ""more aggressively"" than before. Torque vectoring is also enhanced across the three electric motors for sharper cornering at higher speeds. In addition, regenerative braking is accentuated to recuperate extra energy.

Changes to the suspension are also made once Track Mode is activated. It automatically sets the car to its lowest mode and tweaks the adaptive dampers to minimize body roll and consequently improve handling. Upon activation, a dedicated screen pops up, showing a G-meter, lap timer, thermal monitor, and vehicle telemetry, along with turning on the dashcam.

As to why it still can't break the 200-mph barrier, Tesla has previously said the Model S Plaid needs better brakes. The attached footage shows the car coming to a complete halt from 175 mph with the standard brakes. A $20,000 carbon-ceramic set has been officially announced for a mid-2022 release.

Perhaps that is when another software update will unlock the 200-mph capability. Tesla said last year only cars equipped with the larger, optional 21-inch Arachnid wheels will be able to go that fast, which makes sense since the standard 19-inch set is probably too small to fit the wider rotors.

Even at a limited 175 mph, the Model S Plaid still has a higher top speed than the 162-mph Porsche Taycan Turbo S and the 168-mph Lucid Air. If money is no object and you're looking for a substantially faster EV, then look no further than the $2.4-million, 258-mph Rimac Nevera.

As a final note, the Plaid costs almost $155,000 once you add the bigger wheels and the carbon-ceramic brakes.

Electric vehicle (EV) stocks have wasted no time in 2022 making a splash. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 production and delivery numbers on Sunday, blowing expectations out of the water and launching the stock to within striking distance of its all-time high.

Tesla's share price shot up over 14% on the day, which had beneficial ripple effects extending to EV names like Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID). With such a hot start to the year, could EVs be 2022's best-performing industry? Let's look at where the sector could go from here and how investors should play it.

In 2020, solar energy captured the spotlight as the best performing industry. The Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEMKT:TAN), which contains a mix of solar energy players, rose over 230% in 2020. In 2021, the energy sector was the best performing sector in the S&P 500 with oil and gas companies benefitting from rising energy prices and stemming from the fact that it had room to rebound after a rough 2020 (the energy sector was the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 in 2020).

EV stocks did well in 2021, with Lucid gaining 280%, Ford Motor Company up 136%, and many other players outperforming the market. EVs were certainly one of the top industries, but the bulk of the broader market gains was driven by mega-cap tech stocks.

EVs have similar potential to growth industries such as renewable energy, cloud computing, software, cybersecurity, and the metaverse. EVs aren't necessarily a better place to invest, but the chance of success is arguably higher with EVs than, say, which cryptocurrency is going to take off next.

EVs have the potential to impact the daily lives of many in the near future in a personal and visible way. Given how capital intensive the industry is, it's also a long-term growth story that won't change overnight. Companies take time to develop vehicles and scale production. Buying and holding EV stocks could be rewarding from a financial standpoint and the investment thesis is easier for people to understand than say, tech companies working on the metaverse.

Tesla delivered over 308,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, which was 17% higher than the 263,000 expected. To put that number into perspective, consider that Tesla delivered more than two cars per minute in the fourth quarter.

Even more impressive is that Tesla delivered more cars in 2021 than it did in 2020 and 2019 combined. Deliveries increased 87% year over year and are up 924% in the last five years.

Data source: Tesla.

What separates Tesla from other automakers isn't just its torrid growth rate but its profitability. In just three years, Tesla has evolved from an unprofitable, unpredictable, and overpromising business to a polished company that sports the highest operating margin among major automakers.

Having a high operating margin means that Tesla converts roughly $0.15 of every dollar in sales into earnings before interest, taxes, and so forth. The auto industry is an incredibly capital-intensive field. Tesla's direct-to-consumer sales strategy and negligible advertising expenses minimize costs and do a big service to its profitability.

Lucid and Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) hope to follow in Tesla's footsteps by starting with lower-production, higher-margin models and then scaling production so that lower-priced vehicles can be profitable. In Lucid's case, it expects to produce and deliver 20,000 cars in 2022, which is how many Tesla delivered in less than the average week during its fourth quarter.

Lucid's numbers may seem paltry in comparison. But if Lucid is successful in rolling out four trims of its Air sedan at price points ranging from $77,400 to $169,000, it could become established as a formidable player in the luxury EV sedan market. As of its third quarter, Lucid said it has over 17,000 reservations, putting the emphasis on mastering mass production instead of sales.

Similarly, Rivian already has over 71,000 reservations for its R1T electric pickup truck. Its Illinois factory has a production capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year, with plans to expand that to 200,000. It's also building a plant in Georgia with an annual capacity of 400,000 vehicles per year.

2021 was the year Lucid and Rivian proved their technological prowess and went public. In 2022, they'll show whether they can produce and deliver their vehicles, and how they're progressing toward higher production and revenue growth. In 2023 or later, investors should have a better understanding of profit and positive operating cash flow.

Lucid, Tesla, and Ford easily beat the market in 2021. For EV stocks to continue outperforming in 2022, the established players will need to put up strong revenue and profit growth, and up-and-coming players like Lucid and Rivian will need to narrow the gap between their goals and their results.

Despite the potential for newcomers to disrupt the industry, it's important to remember that Lucid and Rivian are a long way from becoming ""the next Tesla."" In many ways, Lucid and Rivian are just the tip of the EV stock iceberg. There's never been a better time to invest in EVs because investors have more options than ever. Crafting your own basket of your favorite EV stocks is a great way to gain exposure to an exciting industry without betting the farm on a single prospect.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'daniel_foelber@fool.com', 'name': 'Daniel Foelber', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659797/1-blue-tesla-model-y_7QVYz2z.jpeg,0.3568627450980393,eng-7381244,False,0.686274528503418,0.3568627450980393,379084860,19

It took on a field of eight finalists, and came out on top after a shockingly brief argument among our editors.

Each of the nominees brought elements to the competition that we liked.

Those finalists were the most diverse we've had to date. With electric luxury sedans from both a startup and a stalwart of the industry to a blown V-8 hooked to a manual transmission, there was something for everyone.

In a perfect world the Rivian R1T would incorporate aspects from our other finalists. It's a flight of fancy, but it's fun to think about.

Follow along as we piece together the 2022 Frankencar, a vehicle with the best bits from the Motor Authority Best Car To Buy 2022 finalists.

Powertrain

The powertrain for the 2022 Frankencar combines internal combustion and electric elements. It's a hybrid of sorts, but in a very different, if not impossible, way. We want instant torque, so let's start with the Rivian R1T's quad electric motors, but up the output to the Lucid Air Dream Edition Performance model's 1,111 hp. For best fast charging, we'll wire in the Lucid's 800-volt electric architecture. Of course, we'd want the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range model's 521 miles of EPA-rated range.

Since we #GiveAShift, we'd somehow bake in the 6-speed manual transmission from the Cadillac Blackwings with their clean throws and easy-to-modulate clutch engagement. Yes, we know electric powertrains don't need a multi-speed transmission or require a clutch, but this is a fantasy, so let us have this.

On that note, we also appreciate the throaty bark of a large displacement V-8. The days of growling V-8s will end with electric powertrains, but artificial engine sounds are piped into gas-powered cars, so why not an EV as well? For the Frankencar, we'll choose the loud battle cry produced by the Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing's supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. For those special moments.

Styling

For this exercise we would keep the Rivian R1T's exterior design. Its innovative packaging could only be achieved by taking a clean-sheet approach to the design possibilities of an electric vehicle. It sports dimensions more inline with a Honda Ridgeline than a Ford F-150, which makes it easier to maneuver in a parking lot. But it still has a 54.0-inch composite bed with underfloor storage to haul stuff securely. Its charging port is located in the front bumper on the driver side, which makes it easy to pull up to a charging station while hauling a trailer. The killer app, the gear tunnel mounted behind the cab, must stay. With 11.6-cubic feet of water-tight storage and the ability to hold up to 300 lb of gear, it's the R1T's ace in the hole.

The Rivian R1T offers impressive dynamics for a vehicle that weighs nearly 7,000 lb, but it can't take a corner like the Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing. Perhaps some combination of the Caddy's magnetic dampers and the McLaren-style hydraulic suspension could give the Frankencar the CT4-V Blackwing's agility. We'll also take the Caddy's steering response and telepathic feel.

That gives us the handling, but we also want to retain the Rivian's off-road capability and air springs With up to 6.5 inches of travel thanks to the air suspension, the R1T can go as low as 7.9 inches or increase its ground clearance to 14.4 inches. We'd have to extend the travel so it could drop another few inches to get the on-road handling we want while retaining the tall ride height. The standard All-Purpose mode provides a rather tall 11.5 inches of clearance, and with no transfer case or differential bits hanging down, the Rivian can take lines other vehicles simply can't.

Interior

The Mercedes-Benz EQS has the most technologically advanced and best appointed interior, hands down. The available Hyperscreen features a 56.0-inch glass panel on the dashboard that covers three screens. The various screens show scores of information, including augmented reality, but Senior Editor Bengt Halvorson found the interface overwhelming, distracting, and migraine inducing. I thought the Rivian's simplified interior trimmed in ash wood was refreshing, with its warm and inviting feel. Your mileage may vary, but there's no arguing the quality of the Benz's interior, which sports leathered-covered everything, real wood, and if you're into that sort of thing, enough ambient LED lighting to rival a Virgin Airlines jumbo jet. It's the old-luxury benchmark. We'd mix in the rear seat leg and headroom of the Lucid Air for passenger comfort. Some of the creative storage solutions from the Rivian, such as the sun glasses cubby under the front seat, we'd bring to the Frankencar.

The R1T costs $67,500, which is appropriate for what you get. In fact, it seems downright reasonable compared to an $80,000 Jeep Wrangler. But in our make-believe scenario the Frankencar would be priced like the Hyundai Elantra N, which costs just $32,925.

And there it is. Our Frankencar is essentially a Rivian R1T with all its capability and utility, but with faster charging and a better electrical architecture, even more power (as if it needs it), a manual transmission (we're creating a ridiculous monster, stick with us), the ability to sound the battle cry of a large displacement V-8 engine when desired, the steering feel and corning capability of the Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing, the high-tech and old-world luxury of the EQS's cabin, and the compact car price of the Hyundai Elantra N.

Someone flip some switches, power up the tubes, and get this metal patient on the table to bring it to life.","{'uri': 'motorauthority.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Motor Authority'}","[{'uri': 'joel_feder@motorauthority.com', 'name': 'Joel Feder', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://images.hgmsites.net/hug/frankencar-2022-the-best-of-our-best-car-to-buy-nominees_100822847_h.jpg,0.2862745098039217,eng-7380498,False,0.6392157077789307,0.2862745098039217,379084020,6

Concerns over range anxiety have been well-documented among prospective electric-vehicle owners. Cases of range excess? Those are more difficult to find.

On the way home from a road trip designed to test the range limits of a prototype battery, that's exactly what an engineering team from a Michigan startup Our Next Energy Inc. encountered.

After starting the day in the Detroit suburb of Novi, Mich., on the morning of Dec. 17, the team traveled north in a Tesla Model S retrofitted with their own battery. They drove north for hours, finally turning around at the Cut River Bridge in the state's Upper Peninsula. Gradually on the return, they recognized that depleting the battery would take longer than anticipated.

""On the way back, we realized we were going to need to burn more energy off, so we decided to go to Lansing, and then after Lansing, we knew we still needed to burn more energy off,"" CEO Mujeeb Ijaz, along for the ride in a chase vehicle, tells Automotive News. ""So we went to Ann Arbor, and then we went to Detroit, and finally, we were like, 'Let's just go back home.'""

By the time they got home at 2 a.m., they had traveled 752 miles on their proof-of-concept battery without recharging. The real-world test occurred at an average speed of 55 miles per hour, and in temperatures that reached a high of 41 degrees Fahrenheit in southeast Michigan and while enduring occasional windy conditions.

That mileage roughly doubles the range of EVs in the market today. Depending on its configuration, the Tesla Model S achieves between 348 and 405 miles, per the latest stated figures from the Environmental Protection Agency. The Chevy Bolt reaches 259 miles in range, per the EPA. The Lucid Air has surpassed all of them with a range as high as 520 miles, albeit at a vehicle sticker price that starts at $77,400 and as high as $169,000.

Battling range anxiety

For Ijaz, the results of the sprawling road trip signaled that Our Next Energy (ONE) had reached an important moment in developing a range-extending battery that may one day ease consumer anxiety about range in EVs.

""One of the early goals we set out to accomplish a forward agenda on is to get more range to electric vehicles, because we really believe that range and adoption are linked together,"" Ijaz said. ""... The problem in electric vehicles today is that we're promising people a certain amount of range, but then the vehicles are not living up to that in the real world. So what we decided to do is go after doubling the amount of energy we could put on board.""

A third-party company validated the results, according to ONE, placing the same vehicle on a dynamometer. It achieved a range of 882 miles at 55 miles per hour.

ONE, which was founded in July 2020, has addressed that challenge with a hybrid battery approach. Engineers have created a workhorse battery intended to handle daily driving and withstand frequent charging. A second battery with a different chemistry will stretch the range for the occasional long trips.

The first battery, called Aries, is designed for durability and scheduled to enter production by the end of this year. The second, called Gemini, is the proof of concept ONE tested in its ride around Michigan. The roadtrip test results will help evolve the battery toward production, though Ijaz says R&D efforts remain ongoing.

In particular, the prototype Gemini battery contained cobalt. Ijaz is adamant about avoiding cobalt in his finished product, because of supply, price and range considerations.

""First and foremost, we want a new material set,"" he said. ""Let's focus on materials that are responsible, that are sustainable and able to be mined anywhere in the world, that are not geographically constrained.""

ONE closed a Series A round in October, receiving $25 million from investors that included Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate-focused venture capital fund started by Bill Gates. Others participating in the round included BMW i Ventures, Flex Ltd., Volta Energy Technologies and Detroit-based VC fund Assembly Ventures.

Breakthrough effort?

Ijaz, a veteran of Ford Motor Co., Apple and A123 Systems, said the landmark roadtrip was a memorable moment. Not necessarily because of the final range achieved, but because of the view he got on the road.

At one point, the gasoline-powered chase vehicle he observed the test from needed to exit the interstate and refuel. The electric car powered by his battery needed no such break.

""Watching that whole thing unfold was one of the highlights of my career,"" he said. ""That vehicle just kind of kept on going, day and night. I think that's a pretty remarkable thing.""","{'uri': 'autonews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Automotive News'}","[{'uri': 'pete_bigelow@autonews.com', 'name': 'Pete Bigelow', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/Gemini-MAIN_i.jpg,0.03529411764705892,eng-7379460,False,0.615686297416687,0.03529411764705892,379083840,1

Daimler has released details of a concept electric vehicle which uses solar technology and bio-based materials, with the German automotive giant saying it has a range of over 1,000 kilometers (around 621 miles) on one charge.

The Vision EQXX has 117 roof-based solar cells -- the idea is that they can help to boost the car's range -- while the vehicle's interior incorporates materials including a leather alternative called Mylo.

Mylo is produced using mycelium, which Daimler described as being ""the underground rootlike structure of mushrooms.""

""It is certified bio-based, which means it is made predominantly from renewable ingredients found in nature,"" Daimler said. Other materials used in the car include a ""cactus-based biomaterial"" called Deserttex and carpets made from bamboo fiber.

In a statement issued Monday, Markus Schafer, Daimler's chief technology officer responsible for development and procurement, said that the technology program behind the concept vehicle would ""define and enable future Mercedes-Benz models and features.""

Schafer had previously announced details of the vehicle's range in a LinkedIn post toward the end of last year. On Monday, Daimler said the range figures were ""preliminary and based on digital simulations in real-life traffic conditions.""

If an electric vehicle were able to travel over 621 miles on a single charge in real-world conditions, it would help dispel concerns about range anxiety. The term refers to the idea that EVs aren't able to undertake long journeys without losing power and getting stranded.

As technology develops, the range of electric vehicles is starting to grow.

Tesla's unique battery technology guaranteed success in this demanding market. High quality isn't enough; success demands something unique in your resume.

The assault in Europe on rarefied German premium auto market turf held by Mercedes, BMW and VW's Audi and Porsche, defeated Nissan's Infiniti, and has perplexed Stellantis's Lancia, DS and Alfa Romeo subsidiaries, and Jaguar. Toyota's Lexus , for all its success in the U.S., can't replicate it in Europe. Even mass manufacturers like Renault and Ford Europe have dusted down premium plans a few times and trashed hundreds of millions of euros of shareholder money on the way to failure.

If, like Tesla, you have a unique story to tell which will excite buyers, sunlit uplands beckon, but history tell us attempts to match the Germans without a charismatic story to back you up are doomed to failure.

Which is a shame because I recently spent a day driving Genesis's first offerings for the European market and they were very impressive. First of all, the scale of the ambition was obvious, as 5 new models were on view with the big G80 sedan, GV80 SUV, smaller G70 sedan, SUV and Shooting Brake. The sleek and handsome GV80 SUV was the highlight with a beautiful interior, fabulous paint job, and as impressive on the road as any pricey competitor. Also, the front grille had a definite hint of Bentley, perhaps not surprising given the Genesis design team's link with the British luxury brand. There's the promise of a range topping GV90 and G90 and a couple of electric cars later this year.

But analysts don't see much demand from the public, or rather the well-heeled minority that can afford vehicles like this or persuade their companies to fund leases for them.

Ian Fletcher, auto analyst for IHS Markit , said sales expectations are weak.

""In Western and Central Europe, excluding mainly Russia, we currently anticipate that its (Genesis) range will make up less than a 0.1% share of the (overall) passenger car market in the region by 2025 and will not fair better by 2030. By comparison, we see (Toyota's) Lexus as selling around 10 times the number of vehicles and taking a 0.4% share of the market in 2025, while Audi will take an around 4% market share, BMW 5% share and Mercedes almost 6%,"" Fletcher said.

Analysts at French auto consultancy Inovev reckon Genesis will take a 1% share of the European premium market in 2025, and 1.5% in 2030.

Inovev calculates that between 2000 and today BMW, Mercedes and Audi won between 69% and 78% of the European premium market, leaving maybe 20% to be fought over by the likes of Volvo, Tesla, Land Rover, Porsche, Lexus, Lancia, Jaguar, Alfa Romeo and DS. And now Genesis.

""The difficulty does not come from the products themselves which can be of a very high level of specification, quality and performance in some cases even superior to BMW, Mercedes or Audi. The difficulty is rather the creation of a brand history. The other possibility is to enter this market with disruptive products which offer something really new, as Tesla did or soon Lucid Air or even NIO of China might,"" Inovev said in an email reply.

""At this stage of Genesis's European proposal, we do not see any arguments that would lead us to believe that the brand could compete head-on with German premium brands, which will remain inaccessible for the next 10 years. Nor do we see any arguments that strongly distinguish the strategy of a brand like Genesis from another premium brand like Lexus, which has never managed to exceed 2% of the premium market despite its edge in hybridization and an extensive sales network distinct from Toyota,"" Inovev said.

In Europe, Genesis is eschewing dealerships and offering long-term service deals which include the collection of cars which require work with a guaranteed replacement. In the U.S., where Hyundai of Korea's Genesis luxury subsidiary has operated since 2015 with a similar formula, it is currently moving to standalone dealerships for the brand.

Genesis started selling in the U.S. in 2016 with 7,000 sales, advancing to 21,200 in 2019 then slipping to 16,400 in 2020. In 2021 sales zoomed to nearly 50,000. In contrast BMW U.S. sales in 2021 were nearly 370,000, according to Automotive News.

Pedro Pacheco, senior research director at Gartner Group agrees that it will be almost impossible for Genesis to eat into the German dominance, but it is possible if it is ""superb at everything and does so consistently"".

""Genesis needs to be known by European customers as clearly beating the German competitors and reinventing the premium car market, and using operational and business models that can provide clear benefits to customers. They must also build a firm grip on the company car market, and that means leasing, as most of the premium car market is fleet. For years the German players have left their competition in the dust by offering their cars with very competitive leasing rates. I know this seems a tall order but that's exactly what it is,"" Pacheco said.

IHS Markit's Fletcher said the no dealership/concierge idea might work. It did for Tesla.

""Tesla is a well-recognized alternative in the marketplace and the brands appeal is this break from the conventional, including the battery electric powertrains. While Genesis has its own unique look, it is still just a traditional, albeit high quality, product under the surface from an unrecognized brand,"" Fletcher said.

""Ultimately, Genesis's success in the market will be dependent on how deep Hyundai's pockets are and how long it is prepared to give Genesis to develop its presence. It could be a decade or more before it can be considered a credible alternative to the German premium brands and not just sell vehicles in the same space. You only have to look at how the market has treated longstanding, better recognized brands such as Jaguar and Alfa Romeo. To choose a Genesis, I think customers will have to really want an alternative to what is essentially the status quo and the alternatives already available,"" Fletcher said.

Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of Germany's Center for Automotive Research said it's all about qualities that are really unmeasurable.

""Genesis needs a strong story, a legacy. And this is exactly what it doesn't have now. It's a bit like Lexus, certainly very good quality, but where is the ""reason why"", why should a premium customer buy it? There are many good cars out there, but only a few have Charisma,"" Dudenhoeffer said.

Electric vehicle maker Lucid plans to start selling its cars in Europe this year.

The California-headquartered firm, which competes with Tesla, announced the expansion on Tuesday after a Twitter user asked if an image of some new Lucid owners were based in the U.K.

""Expansion to European markets will begin this year. Stay tuned for country-specific delivery information,"" the company tweeted in response.

Lucid did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for more information.

Lucid's first vehicle is called the Air sedan. It started delivering a $169,000 ""Dream Edition"" of the flagship car to customers in late October, following commercial production beginning a month earlier at a new factory in Casa Grande, Arizona. The car has an industry-leading range of 520 miles.

Like Tesla, Lucid is trying to develop autonomous driving technology that enables its cars to safely drive themselves.

Axel Schmidt, who heads up the automotive sector at consultancy firm Accenture, told CNBC Wednesday that tech companies have ""underestimated all the challenges"" when it comes to getting autonomous vehicles on the road.

He added that 60% to 70% of new cars will have ""Level 2"" autonomous driving capabilities by 2030. That means the cars will assist with steering, staying in the right lane and controlling speed but they won't be able to safely drive themselves until they reach ""Level 5.""

European reservations

In January 2020, Lucid started taking online reservations in 15 European countries for its flagship Lucid Air sedan but the firm has not specified when the vehicles will be delivered.

Locations included Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The company, founded in 2007 and led by former Tesla executive Peter Rawlinson, went public through a SPAC deal in July that valued it at around $24 billion.

That month, it told investors that it expects to produce 20,000 Lucid Air sedans in 2022, generating more than $2.2 billion in revenue.

Overtaking Ford

Four months later, Lucid's market value blew past Ford to $89.9 billion after executives told investors that reservations for its first vehicles had jumped and that its production plans for 2022 were still on track. At the time, it said it has more than 17,000 reservations for its Air sedan, up from 13,000 through the third quarter.

However, shares tanked around 20% last month when Lucid disclosed a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission likely into the company's SPAC deal to go public.

Lucid said although there is ""no assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter, the investigation appears to concern the business combination"" between the automaker and blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. IV.

Today, Lucid is valued at around $65 billion and its market cap is still far below Tesla, which surged to more than $1 trillion last year. Rivian, an EV start-up that went public in November, has a market cap of about $91 billion.

When Tesla introduced the Model S Plaid last year, it touted an impressive top speed of 200 mph (322 km/h). However, you won't be able to go that fast since the EV is electronically governed at 163 mph (262 km/h). Those with the need for speed will be glad to hear a new software update loosens up the limiter to 175 mph (282 km/h), and while it's not the supercar-matching velocity we were promised, it's still an improvement.

Several new videos show a Model S Plaid with the latest OTA update, which comes along with a Track Mode. Mind you, the car will still be able to hit 175 mph even without the newly added mode selected. Per Tesla, the Track Mode turns off some driver assistance systems and should be used only on a track to ""experience the unmatched performance at many different venues.""

What does Track Mode do? According to the release notes, it boosts powertrain performance after dialing up the heat pump to cool ""more aggressively"" than before. Torque vectoring is also enhanced across the three electric motors for sharper cornering at higher speeds. In addition, regenerative braking is accentuated to recuperate extra energy.

Changes to the suspension are also made once Track Mode is activated. It automatically sets the car to its lowest mode and tweaks the adaptive dampers to minimize body roll and consequently improve handling. Upon activation, a dedicated screen pops up, showing a G-meter, lap timer, thermal monitor, and vehicle telemetry, along with turning on the dashcam.

As to why it still can't break the 200-mph barrier, Tesla has previously said the Model S Plaid needs better brakes. The attached footage shows the car coming to a complete halt from 175 mph with the standard brakes. A $20,000 carbon-ceramic set has been officially announced for a mid-2022 release.

Perhaps that is when another software update will unlock the 200-mph capability. Tesla said last year only cars equipped with the larger, optional 21-inch Arachnid wheels will be able to go that fast, which makes sense since the standard 19-inch set is probably too small to fit the wider rotors.

Even at a limited 175 mph, the Model S Plaid still has a higher top speed than the 162-mph Porsche Taycan Turbo S and the 168-mph Lucid Air. If money is no object and you're looking for a substantially faster EV, then look no further than the $2.4-million, 258-mph Rimac Nevera.

As a final note, the Plaid costs almost $155,000 once you add the bigger wheels and the carbon-ceramic brakes.

In January 2020, Lucid started taking online reservations in 15 European countries for its flagship Lucid Air sedan but the firm has not specified when the vehicles will be delivered.

Locations included Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The company, founded in 2007 and led by former Tesla executive Peter Rawlinson, went public through a SPAC deal in July that valued it at around $24 billion.

That month, it told investors that it expects to produce 20,000 Lucid Air sedans in 2022, generating more than $2.2 billion in revenue.

Four months later, Lucid's market value blew past Ford to $89.9 billion after executives told investors that reservations for its first vehicles had jumped and that its production plans for 2022 were still on track. At the time, it said it has more than 17,000 reservations for its Air sedan, up from 13,000 through the third quarter.

However, shares tanked around 20% last month when Lucid disclosed a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission likely into the company's SPAC deal to go public.

Lucid said although there is ""no assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter, the investigation appears to concern the business combination"" between the automaker and blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. IV.

Rarely does a concept car create serious waves within the car industry, but the Mercedes Vision EQXX is no ordinary concept.

As Motor Trend puts it, the EV could be ""one of the most consequential concept cars of the early 21st century.""

""[It's] what folks who've been building automobiles for more than a century can do when they turn the might of their huge research and development budgets entirely to thinking about designing and engineering a better electric vehicle.""

Capable of traveling 620 miles on a single charge, the Vision EQXX can go much farther than anything on the market. That includes leaders like the Tesla Model S Long Range (405 miles) and the Formula E supplier Lucid's Air Dream Edition Range (520 miles).

The Merc also does so with a smaller battery pack than those two, making it significantly more efficient. And it was brought from the drawing board to road-ready fruition in just 18 months, thanks in-part to the expert engineering pedigree of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team.

""It would have been easy to just use a big battery to get the range,"" said EQXX drivetrain engineer Tim Wolfel. ""But we wanted that range in a compact vehicle.""

Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency. Power comes form a single 200-hp electric motor mounted to the rear axle, utilizing Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrain to ensure 95 percent of the energy sent from the 900V, ultra-dense battery goes to the wheels. There are also 117 solar panels in the roof, good for a 15-mile increase in range.

A tiny drag coefficient of .19 is achieved with drastically tapered cabin a rear track that's two inches narrower than the front. A long tail reduces turbulence, and an active diffuser lowers and extends at 40 mph to keep the speed of the air coming from undernearth the car is equal to air streaming off sides and top.

The interior, while containing some current Mercedes components, gets a huge curved 8K screen that runs between the A-pillars and displays video game-engine-powered graphics. All fabrics are made of either plant-based organic materials or recycled plastics, from biofabricated silk to animal-less leather and bamboo fiber.

""The Vison EQXX is an advanced car in so many dimensions - and it even looks stunning and futuristic,"" said Mercedes-Benz executive Ola Kallenius.

Instead of a new game, however, it's making a television series.

The announcement was made during Sony's CES 2022 keynote, alongside official details for PlayStation VR 2. However, details on the TV project are incredibly scarce, with Sony not sharing anything else beyond the news of its existence. This technically isn't new information either, as there have been reports of a Twisted Metal TV show being in development since 2019. But news about it has been so fleeting and sparse that people seemed to either forget about it or assume that it was only a rumor.

Sony originally confirmed a Twisted Metal TV series was in development during an investors meeting (via IGN) and, in February 2021, Variety revealed that it will be a live-action comedy series from Deadpool writers Rhett Reese and Paul Vernick.

The show will apparently see a ""motor-mouthed outsider"" be offered a chance at a better life, so long as he can successfully deliver a package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland. According to Deadline, The Falcon & the Winter Soldier star Anthony Mackie will play the lead role, although series mascot Sweet Tooth will make an appearance as well.

Twisted Metal is a vehicular combat game that debuted in 1995 for the PlayStation One. Think of it as an even more violent and darkly humorous Destruction AllStars. The series was something of a staple of the original PlayStation, receiving three sequels.

It was rebooted twice, once for the PlayStation 2 in 2001 and again for the PlayStation 3 in 2012, but has been completely neglected by Sony since, aside from Sweet Tooth making an appearance in the crossover fighting game PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

There have been rumors of a new Twisted Metal game, one made specifically to tie in with the TV show, for a while now. GamesBeat's Jeff Grubb claimed in September that one was in the works as part of a strategy by Sony to synergize its first-party games with its movies and TV shows (thanks VGC). He added that it will not involve series director David Jaffe, who left Sony in 2007.

VGC's own sources say that Lucid Games will develop it, which makes sense as this is the same studio that made the aforementioned Destruction AllStars. It will reportedly even adopt a similar free-to-play model and will supposedly launch alongside the TV show in 2023.

While a new Twisted Metal game hasn't been confirmed yet, the official announcement of a revival (albeit one for TV), certainly adds weight to the rumors of a new game.","{'uri': 'techradar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechRadar'}","[{'uri': 'michael_beckwith@techradar.com', 'name': 'Michael Beckwith', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VEfxQntBYQ54YvwjpWRyUj-1200-80.jpg,0.1058823529411765,eng-7392729,False,0.886274516582489,0.1058823529411765,379081200,1

During the eight years he spent building out Tesla's sales and retail strategy, Dustin Krause learned one key thing about electric cars.

""If you can get somebody to just give it consideration, and if your product can show how it's special, it'll end up selling itself,"" Krause said.

The former Tesla executive brings that mindset to Volkswagen, where he's now spearheading a $100 billion electrification push. ""The most well executed strategy and products are going to win,"" he told Insider.

That matches some of Krause's best advice for industry newcomers.

Krause joined Tesla in 2009 and in addition to leading retail, founded its used car business. He left Tesla and cofounded Current Automotive, a Chicago-based, online pre-owned EV retail startup, before becoming head of Volkswagen's electric mobility division in 2018.

Volkswagen's been reinventing itself in the aftermath of its $14.7 billion Dieselgate settlement, resulting from the scandal when it was found to have been cheating vehicles emissions tests. The company's spending $100 billion over the next five years and is planning for a quarter of its global vehicle sales to be electric by 2026.

Given his experience with Tesla and Volkswagen, Krause has four pieces of advice for those looking to join the industry.

Even established companies are undergoing unprecedented transformations, Krause said. That's what makes the industry so exciting to join.

""We're all a startup in this,"" he said. ""No matter what you're going to do, you're going to be going into green grass. And that's really exciting, because if you have a clear vision of what you want to accomplish in this, the sky's the limit.

""For somebody that's starting,"" he added, ""there's a lot of place to grow.""

Krause said Volkswagen recruits those with engineering and user experience backgrounds, but those aren't the only opportunities available.

""A beginner's mindset here is important because, sure, there's the core of what we do, and there's a lot of the VW soul in this product, but there's also a lot of new things. We're working on over the air updates. We're working on completely new user experiences in the car. We're looking at different driving aspects. We're looking at charging. It's the untapped opportunity that's out there.""

Transitioning trucks, delivery vans, and other commercial vehicles to electric, and getting most consumers into an EV will take time, Krause said.

""We're going to run into roadblocks. You're going to run into infrastructure roadblocks. You're going to run into different product segments that are difficult,"" he said.

""You have to make some mistakes, and that's actually okay, because you're going to learn from it, but you have to be able to pivot quickly.""

Aside from Tesla, Volkswagen is facing a lot of competition in the EV industry: incumbents Ford, General Motors, and even Toyota, alongside startups like Rivian and Lucid are all investing billions of dollars into EVs. But focusing on others can be harmful, Krause said.

""The best thing to do is to focus on what you've got, to not think about what everybody's doing,"" he said. ""I don't sit around to really think about what others are doing or what the industry is doing, because that would be a distraction.

""It's pretty clear: the transformation is upon us and everyone is trying to find their way in, but there will be winners and losers.""","{'uri': 'businessinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Business Insider'}","[{'uri': 'alexa_st_john@businessinsider.com', 'name': 'Alexa St. John', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.insider.com/61d4af375a119b00184b066a?width=1200&format=jpeg,0.05882352941176472,,True,0,0.05882352941176472,379080060,1

Among the biggest winners: Lucid Motors and Moderna! Among the losers: Zoom and Peleton.

ADAM SHAPIRO: Jared Blikre, University of Miami, Jared?

JARED BLIKRE: I went to Florida. I went to Florida International, so go Golden Panthers. However, I guess I would vote for- I would root for University of Michigan, just because they're the other UM, of course next to the University of Miami.

Let's go straight to the YFi Interactive. We want to do our year-end recap for 2021. And I got some stats to share here, really interesting.

I'll go through the majors first. Let's start with the S&P 500, up 20- almost 27% year to date, by the way, the NASDAQ 100 also up 27% not shown. What we do have is the NASDAQ composite, a little bit less here. That's about 21% for the year.

Finally, the DOW is a really big laggard here, if you can call almost 19% year to date a laggard- pretty impressive. Russell 2000, not a major index, the minor index came in with total returns of 13 and 1/2%. Now, I just want to point out these were not the best-performing indices around the world.

The CAC 40 up nearly 29% and finally the Tel Aviv market- oh, it doesn't want to cooperate here. But there we go, up 31%. So that is actually the big winner.

Now, I want to delve into our heat maps here. This is going to be the S&P 500 top winners and losers. So let's see here. Yeah, we got top winners and losers.

And not surprisingly, Lucid Monor- Lucid Motors, excuse me, up 280% tops the list not only for the S&P 500. And this is a SPAC, so I need to get on the right screen here. There we go. This is looking more like what I was expecting.

Energy names are dominating the S&P 500 biggest winners and losers. We've got the top 10 and the bottom 10 right here, Devon Energy up over 178%. We have Marathon Petroleum. That's up over- or Marathon Oil, that's up over 146%. That's the year to date total there.

And we also have FANG. That is Diamondback Energy. That's up 123%.

XLE, the S&P 500 energy sector ETF, just had its best year ever, up over 40%. Some other names at the top, we got Ford Motors. Bed Bath & Body Works, that's up over 132%. NVIDIA, somewhat of a laggard here among the top 10, but really impressive performance of 125%.

But let's cover those names to the downside because we got a couple of gambling names filling out the bottom three. PENN, that would be Penn National Gaming. That is down nearly 40% and then Las Vegas Sands down 37%, so not the best year for these particular gaming names.

We also have Global Payments. That's off over 37. Activision Blizzard, that's down over 28. And the list goes on.

I do want to go to the NASDAQ 100. A little bit of confusion on my part before because the top winner here and not the S&P 500 is Lucid Motors up 280%. That is followed by Moderna up 143%.

But something you'll notice about a lot of these names, they are well off their highs. These numbers could be substantially higher had we taken them- or had the year closed at their peak. But it didn't, so we'll look at the trends here at the top.

A couple of names that are pretty big here- NVIDIA, that became a mega cap stock this year, more than doubling in price up over 125%. Also Applied Materials rounding out some of the top movers here, that is up 82%.

It's the downside which really catches investors' attention here. Peloton, knocking off 75%, 76%, of its value this year- pretty tough story right there. China stocks are represented by Pinduoduo. That's down 67% this year.

And by the way, I don't even think that's the worst fare in that particular cohort. And then finally rounding out the dark red here, we got Zoom down 45%. But if we were to go down the list even further- Splunk, DocuSign- the software names really took it on the chin in the final months of the year. At least some of them did, having a rough go of it.

But overall, you take a look at what the trends have been this year. It's been one of winners and losers, the indices doing very well, the passive investors doing very well. But a lot of investors' portfolios this year were not tracking the indices. A lot of times the index would be up half a percent, 1%, in people's portfolios would be down multiple percents.

So it's been a tricky year. I just want to round out the discussion with the sector action. As promised XLE, the best-performing performing sector of the year, up over 46% followed by real estate, 41%. Then we got tech, financials, and consumer discretionary rounding out the top.

Everything's in the green. Utilities, staples, those round out the laggards, both up over 14%. If I didn't say it before, I just want to say XLE, the energy sector for the S&P 500 and the real estate sector for the S&P 500, having their best years ever, Adam.

Time to Sell? | The Motley Fool,"Lucid and Rivian could be better buys today given Tesla's valuation.

Monday kicked off the new trading year with a bang as the S&P 500 burst through to a fresh all-time high. Yet the most striking story was Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) blowout fourth-quarter 2021 and full-year production and delivery results. The company beat expectations, and its share price rose over 14% on the day.

As the fifth-largest company in the U.S. with a market cap of $1.2 trillion, is it time to sell Tesla after the big day? Or does the company's stock deserve to be higher?

Tesla gained $144 billion in market cap on Monday, which is roughly the combined value of Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) and Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN). Lucid and Rivian receive their fair share of criticism for being extremely expensive stocks since both companies have negligible revenue, unclear production roadmaps, and will most likely be unprofitable for several years. Yet were Tesla's better-than-expected production and delivery numbers really so impressive that they warrant the company to gain that much value in a single day? Yes and no.

Tesla delivered over 308,000 cars in Q4, which was 45,000 more cars than expected. That's more than the 20,000 cars Lucid expects to deliver in all of 2022. Rivian hasn't outlined exact production figures for 2022. Despite having a current production capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year, Rivian delivered just 386 trucks and SUVs in the third quarter of 2021.

Lucid and Rivian shouldn't be valued on their near-term production targets. Rather, these businesses are valued based on what they could become over time. To their credit, both companies have proved they have impressive technology and have carved out their own niches in the EV market. Lucid is taking a stab at the high-end luxury sedan market with industry-leading range and horsepower. Rivian is targeting the outdoorsy and adventurer market with powerful trucks and SUVs built for rugged terrain. To say that Tesla's quarterly delivery beat is worth the same as these two electric car companies is a stretch.

Another story published alongside the Tesla production and delivery numbers is the forced recall concerning 475,000 Tesla vehicles. Recalling a Tesla vehicle for an ongoing battery or self-driving problem would be serious. However, that's not what these recent recalls are for.

According to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports, the recall is simply for defective Model 3 backup cameras and Model S trunk latches. What's more, Tesla estimates that only 1% of the 356,309 Model 3s involved could have these defects. For the Model S, it's a similar story, as 14% of the 119,009 vehicles involved are estimated to be defective. Add it up, and that's just 20,224 cars that are estimated to be impacted from this recall, not nearly half a million.

To fix the problem, Tesla Service will inspect the issue and customers may be eligible for reimbursement through Tesla's General Recall Reimbursement plan. Recalls sound scary, but this one was overblown.

When investors buy shares of a company, they are ultimately saying they think the stock's current market cap is a fair price. Buyers who were willing to pay 14% more for Tesla stock on Monday were essentially validating the company was worth $144 billion more from the news. In this vein, a 50/50 split of Lucid and Rivian stock could be a better buy.

In its Q3 earnings report, Rivian said it raised $13.7 billion from its initial public offering. Lucid reported $4.8 billion in cash during its third quarter but has since landed $1.75 billion from convertible senior notes due in 2026. In sum, both companies have ample dry powder to fund a rapid production ramp.

While it's unlikely either will become the next Tesla, a distinct advantage Lucid and Rivian have over Tesla's early days is investor support and cash. When Tesla wasn't profitable or cash flow positive (a position Lucid and Rivian are likely to be in over the medium term), it had few choices other than to dilute its stock even as its share price fell. Today, investor sentiment and the auto industry, in general, are very optimistic about the future of EVs, suggesting Lucid and Rivian are just the tip of the EV stock iceberg.

Despite its high valuation, it's probably not a good idea to sell Tesla's stock now in hopes of locking in the best returns. Tesla hasn't even begun production at its Germany or Texas 'gigafactories.' Demand is stronger than ever, as the tailwinds of the EV industry gain momentum. Tesla is set up to have another big year in 2022 and keep the momentum going. As the industry leader, Tesla could certainly be included in a basket of EV stocks for investors taking that approach. And that's probably a smart strategy. With so many options to choose from today, other EV stocks offer more upside than buying just Tesla stock at current levels.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'daniel_foelber@fool.com', 'name': 'Daniel Foelber', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659805/1-rivian-r1t.jpeg,0.2470588235294118,eng-7381244,False,0.6352941393852234,0.2470588235294118,379078020,17

During the eight years he spent building out Tesla's sales and retail strategy, Dustin Krause learned one key thing about electric cars.

""If you can get somebody to just give it consideration, and if your product can show how it's special, it'll end up selling itself,"" Krause said.

The former Tesla executive brings that mindset to Volkswagen, where he's now spearheading a $100 billion electrification push. ""The most well executed strategy and products are going to win,"" he told Insider.

That matches some of Krause's best advice for industry newcomers.

Krause joined Tesla in 2009 and in addition to leading retail, founded its used car business. He left Tesla and cofounded Current Automotive, a Chicago-based, online pre-owned EV retail startup, before becoming head of Volkswagen's electric mobility division in 2018.

Volkswagen's been reinventing itself in the aftermath of its $14.7 billion Dieselgate settlement, resulting from the scandal when it was found to have been cheating vehicles emissions tests. The company's spending $100 billion over the next five years and is planning for a quarter of its global vehicle sales to be electric by 2026.

Given his experience with Tesla and Volkswagen, Krause has four pieces of advice for those looking to join the industry.

Even established companies are undergoing unprecedented transformations, Krause said. That's what makes the industry so exciting to join.

""We're all a startup in this,"" he said. ""No matter what you're going to do, you're going to be going into green grass. And that's really exciting, because if you have a clear vision of what you want to accomplish in this, the sky's the limit.

""For somebody that's starting,"" he added, ""there's a lot of place to grow.""

Krause said Volkswagen recruits those with engineering and user experience backgrounds, but those aren't the only opportunities available.

""A beginner's mindset here is important because, sure, there's the core of what we do, and there's a lot of the VW soul in this product, but there's also a lot of new things. We're working on over the air updates. We're working on completely new user experiences in the car. We're looking at different driving aspects. We're looking at charging. It's the untapped opportunity that's out there.""

Transitioning trucks, delivery vans, and other commercial vehicles to electric, and getting most consumers into an EV will take time, Krause said.

""We're going to run into roadblocks. You're going to run into infrastructure roadblocks. You're going to run into different product segments that are difficult,"" he said.

""You have to make some mistakes, and that's actually okay, because you're going to learn from it, but you have to be able to pivot quickly.""

Aside from Tesla, Volkswagen is facing a lot of competition in the EV industry: incumbents Ford, General Motors, and even Toyota, alongside startups like Rivian and Lucid are all investing billions of dollars into EVs. But focusing on others can be harmful, Krause said.

""The best thing to do is to focus on what you've got, to not think about what everybody's doing,"" he said. ""I don't sit around to really think about what others are doing or what the industry is doing, because that would be a distraction.

""It's pretty clear: the transformation is upon us and everyone is trying to find their way in, but there will be winners and losers.""","{'uri': 'markets.businessinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Markets Insider'}",[],https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/61d4c3865a119b00184b0cfb?format=jpeg,0.05882352941176472,,False,0,0.05882352941176472,379077300,1

When Tesla introduced the Model S Plaid last year, it touted an impressive top speed of 200 mph (322 km/h). However, you won't be able to go that fast since the EV is electronically governed at 163 mph (262 km/h). Those with the need for speed will be glad to hear a new software update loosens up the limiter to 175 mph (282 km/h), and while it's not the supercar-matching velocity we were promised, it's still an improvement.

Several new videos show a Model S Plaid with the latest OTA update, which comes along with a Track Mode. Mind you, the car will still be able to hit 175 mph even without the newly added mode selected. Per Tesla, the Track Mode turns off some driver assistance systems and should be used only on a track to ""experience the unmatched performance at many different venues.""

What does Track Mode do? According to the release notes, it boosts powertrain performance after dialing up the heat pump to cool ""more aggressively"" than before. Torque vectoring is also enhanced across the three electric motors for sharper cornering at higher speeds. In addition, regenerative braking is accentuated to recuperate extra energy.

Changes to the suspension are also made once Track Mode is activated. It automatically sets the car to its lowest mode and tweaks the adaptive dampers to minimize body roll and consequently improve handling. Upon activation, a dedicated screen pops up, showing a G-meter, lap timer, thermal monitor, and vehicle telemetry, along with turning on the dashcam.

As to why it still can't break the 200-mph barrier, Tesla has previously said the Model S Plaid needs better brakes. The attached footage shows the car coming to a complete halt from 175 mph with the standard brakes. A $20,000 carbon-ceramic set has been officially announced for a mid-2022 release.

Perhaps that is when another software update will unlock the 200-mph capability. Tesla said last year only cars equipped with the larger, optional 21-inch Arachnid wheels will be able to go that fast, which makes sense since the standard 19-inch set is probably too small to fit the wider rotors.

Even at a limited 175 mph, the Model S Plaid still has a higher top speed than the 162-mph Porsche Taycan Turbo S and the 168-mph Lucid Air. If money is no object and you're looking for a substantially faster EV, then look no further than the $2.4-million, 258-mph Rimac Nevera.

As a final note, the Plaid costs almost $155,000 once you add the bigger wheels and the carbon-ceramic brakes.","{'uri': 'motor1.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Motor1.com'}",[],https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/1mMG3/s3/tesla-model-s-plaid-in-red.jpg,0.2078431372549019,eng-7386071,False,0.8588235378265381,0.2078431372549019,379077180,1

DETROIT: Our Next Energy (ONE), a two-year-old Michigan startup, said on Wednesday it had tested a prototype of its new battery in a Tesla Model S, driving 752 miles (1,210 kilometers) before recharging.

ONE aims to begin producing battery packs that will deliver similar range - about double that of most existing electric vehicles - by late 2023, according to Mujeeb Ijaz, ONE's founder and chief executive.

""We plan to build (batteries) in North America, and believe it can be done economically,"" Ijaz said in an interview.

ONE has focused on developing an advanced long-range battery that uses safer and more sustainable materials, while packing more energy into a smaller, less expensive package.

Ijaz, a 30-year industry veteran, is a former senior executive at Apple and A123 Systems, where he led teams developing battery systems for electric vehicles.

For ONE's Gemini battery, Ijaz said: ""We want to eliminate both nickel and cobalt, but we don't want to give up energy density. We aim to re-invent battery chemistry as well as the cell architecture"" in order to provide at least 750 miles of range between charges.

""If you put that much energy on board, you are ready for anything the customer asks - a round trip from Detroit to Chicago, or towing a trailer.""

ONE's range target is well beyond even the best of current electric vehicles, including the Lucid Air, which offers just over 500 miles of range in the top version.

Ijaz said ONE chose a Tesla Model S to showcase its prototype battery because ""it has fairly high efficiency and a fairly large battery pack"" which provided enough space to fit ONE's battery.

The testing was done in a road test across Michigan in late December, at an average speed of 55 miles per hour, ONE said.

FALLON/AFP or licensors

One of the world's biggest trade fairs returns to Las Vegas on Wednesday in the shadow of the outbreak of the Omicron COVID-19 variant.

The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) will take place in person for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to go virtual last year, making it the first major in-person tech conference to take place in the United States since the start of the pandemic.

Although there is much excitement, the event will be much quieter than in previous years.

Multiple companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, BMW and Meta, formerly known as Facebook, reduced or cancelled their attendance due to fears over Omicron.

The Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which hosts the event, said more than 2,200 exhibitors and over 3,300 members of the media have registered for in-person attendance.

Masks and proof of vaccination are required at the event, which opens on Wednesday and ends on Friday, a day earlier than scheduled due to the surge in COVID-19 cases.

Although the CES may be dampened this year, it is giving room for start-ups to exhibit the latest technologies, and there is a lot to look forward to; from space travel and the metaverse to health tech.

Here is what we can expect to see this year.

One of the CES' space tech exhibitors is the Colorado-based Sierra Space. The company wants to build a space station with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin in this decade to replace the ISS as a commercial destination.

While those attending the CES will not get a free ticket to space, they will be able to get up close to Sierra Space's Dream Chaser space plane.

On Friday, the first head-to-head autonomous race car challenge will take place on the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

Driverless cars will hit speeds of nearly 260km/h.

""It's completely self-driven. There's software that tells the car what to do,"" said Paul Mitchell, president and CEO of Energy Systems Network, the organisers of the Indy Autonomous Challenge racing competition.

""It takes the information from the sensors and it tells the car whether to turn, whether to brake, accelerate or overtake another vehicle,"" he told AFP.

The tech is not only trying to break the boundaries of speed, it is also hoped that one-day driverless cars will be able to operate themselves on highways.

The pandemic is not just dominating the global agenda but health tech too.

The company Ible will unveil an air purifier which has built-in headphones. As part of its Airvida range, the Airvida E1 is able to purify the air around you while letting you enjoy music through a pair of noise-cancelling headphones.

Meanwhile, one COVID-19 mask has a ventilation system that is powered by a rechargeable battery that can be mounted under a face covering.

""The first way to use it is when you are on a plane or a train,"" entrepreneur Eric Fouchard told AFP. ""The second one is when you are working and you need to remove the mist on your glasses.""

Another COVID-19 mask that has an ""active"" filter capable of destroying fine particles and pathogens or pollutants will also be on display. It is much thicker than the surgical masks and promises to let barely any nasties in.

""Traditional masks are not 100 per cent airtight, air passes through the sides. Our mask is completely airtight,"" Trong Dai Nguyen, an engineer with Airxom, the company that makes the masks, told AFP.

The current model is due to be released in a few months, for about $340 (€300). But the company says in the long run it is cheaper than surgical masks.

Meanwhile, Withings is showing off its new Body Scan smart scale, which not only measures your weight but can also sense your heart rhythm and nerve activity in the feet.

The scale can also track body composition in separate body parts (such as arms, legs or torso) by breaking it down into whole-body fat and water percentages, visceral fat, muscle and bone mass, and extracellular and intracellular water.

And it can conduct ECG readings, which could be vital for understanding cardiovascular health.

""It (the scale) can help us better understand our body, by helping us lose weight and understand body composition and it can help with cardiovascular health,"" Withings CEO Mathieu Letombe told Euronews Next.

He predicts health tech monitoring products will become much more mainstream within two years and used more by medical professionals.

""Along with doctors being amazed with the health data that tech products can monitor, saying it had saved lives, the pandemic has really accelerated telemedicine,"" Letombe said.

If health tracking is your thing, then look no further than the smart lighting company Sengled. It has announced a trove of products for the CES, including its Smart Health Monitoring bulb, which can track your heart rate and how you sleep.

Samsung will unveil its Galaxy S21 FE. The smartphone is a slightly lower-cost version of the Galaxy S21. You can save about $100 (€88) but you lose RAM and it has a lower-resolution telephoto lens than the S21.

Television screens will be massive at this year's CES. Samsung will also show off its new MICRO LED and Neo QLED TVs. Not only will they offer a pretty picture but you can also discover, trade and purchase NFTS.

Mercedes-Benz will showcase a prototype car, an electric which has a range exceeding 1,000 km on a single charge. If it goes into production, it will rival Tesla's Model S and Lucid Air Dream and many other EVs in the industry which have an average range of 300 km.

The metaverse was a big talking point in 2021 and continues to be in the new year. As tech companies grapple with how to finesse the technology, one company will be showing off a wearable wireless vest that may connect you to the metaverse in a physical way.

The vest by Spanish company Owo is currently being tested for video games and works by delivering vibrations that simulate more than 30 different sensations your online avatar may be experiencing.

Also in display, will be the the Shiftall Megane X virtual reality headphones and mutalk microphone for metaverse experiences.

Cute tech

And then there is a plush cat that nibbles your fingers.

""We find it very comfortable and we want to bring it to the world,"" Shunsuke Aoki, CEO of Japanese firm Yukai Engineering told AFP.

Aoki said young dogs or cats will harmlessly do the same thing and it can be a source of comfort.

""In a COVID situation, with people staying home every day, it gives you very good comfort,"" he said.","{'uri': 'euronews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Euronews English'}",[],https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/34/96/96/1000x563_cmsv2_a6ef839a-fd5b-55f1-a2cf-6fd79987421a-6349696.jpg,0.03529411764705892,,False,0,0.03529411764705892,379075020,1

The strong fourth quarter of 308,600 vehicles gave Tesla full-year sales of 936,000, up 87 per cent from the 2020 total, and above the 900,000 mark that had been the target set by many analysts, according to CNN.

""Taking a step back, with the chip shortage a major overhang on the auto space and logistical issues globally these delivery numbers were jaw-dropping,"" Dan Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients.

He said Wall Street forecasts of 265,000 Tesla sales in the fourth quarter would have taken full-year sales to 892,000. The 900,000 sales target that Tesla easily cleared was a ""best case number in the eyes of the street,"" according to Ives.

Other automakers are all expected to report reduced fourth-quarter sales when they release US numbers this coming week. Tesla reports only global sales, but industry-wide, global auto sales are expected to be broadly lower in the fourth quarter.

Cox Automotive is forecasting that overall US fourth quarter sales will be down 24 per cent due to the shortage of computer chips that caused plants to temporarily shut, limited the inventory of vehicles in dealerships and drove up car prices to record levels.

""The industry ran out of vehicles, and sales stalled in the second half,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, chief economist for Cox Automotive. ""Total sales in the second-half of 2021 were the slowest in a decade. Demand is healthy, but supply and production disruptions kept the industry in check. You can't sell what you don't have.""

Tesla had its own chip shortage issues during the year but was able to manage through them. The EV maker's achievement was more impressive considering that it is facing increased competition from traditional automakers now offering more electric vehicle models.

For example, the Ford Mustang Mach-E had US sales of nearly 25,000 vehicles through November in its first year on the market. Ford recently announced plans to triple production to meet demand. There are also new EV-only automakers now selling vehicles, including Lucid and Rivian, which both recently won Motor Trend's car and truck of the year honors.

So while Telsa's share of the EV market might be declining somewhat in the face of new competition, the demand for EVs is growing even faster, allowing Tesla to continue to report strong growth.

""While there are many competitors in the EV space, Tesla continues to dominate market share as evidenced again this quarter while battling through the chip shortage,"" Ives said.

Tesla has forecast that with new factories near Austin, Texas, and Berlin about to start full-scale production in 2022, it should have annual global sales growth of 50 per cent or better for at least the next few years.

Investors have rewarded Tesla, lifting its share price 52 per cent in 2021. While that's modest compared to the 743 per cent gain shares achieved in 2020, it was still better than most automakers, including most other EV-only companies. And it was enough to give Tesla a market value greater than the combined value of the 12 largest global automakers, and to make it only the sixth company ever to be worth more than $1tn.","{'uri': 'businessday.ng', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Businessday NG'}","[{'uri': 'oladehinde_oladipo@businessday.ng', 'name': 'Oladehinde Oladipo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://149520306.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla.jpg,-0.01960784313725494,,True,0,-0.01960784313725494,379074960,1

OPEC, Russia and their allies agreed Tuesday to continue adding 400,000 barrels of oil a day to the global market each month. Demand is rising as we learn to live with COVID-19, and we will need more energy as economic activity exceeds 2019 levels.

Texas and Oklahoma oil executives are also ramping up, according to a quarterly survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

""Most executives expect their firm's capital spending to rise in 2022 compared with 2021,"" the Dallas Fed reported. ""Forty-four percent of executives said they expect capital spending to increase slightly, while an additional 31 percent anticipate a significant increase.""

More drilling means more jobs. The industry has already added more than 35,000 positions since January 2021, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. But there are headwinds, notably higher costs for labor, rigs and capital.

OPEC and its allies will also defend their market share by ensuring prices don't rise too high and trigger more investment in North American oil fields. The cartel is watching demand and price closely and adding capacity to keep them stable at an acceptable level for all.

Texas and Oklahoma drillers are budgeting $65 to $70 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate in 2022. But analysts expect prices to remain around the current level, $75 a barrel, which, if true, should put a damper on inflation next year.

Some headline-grabbing analysts say oil could hit $100 or more. But only a geopolitical crisis or market manipulation could trigger such a spike; there is no shortage of available supply.

Current prices are high enough, though, to make new electric vehicles more attractive. While battery prices remain high, the $1.10 a gallon equivalent for fuel makes EVs more price-competitive when gasoline averages $3.25 a gallon.

Market watchers predict global plug-in electric vehicle sales, including hybrids and EVs, will reach 6.5 million in 2021, up from 3.1 million in 2020. EV sales in November 2021 jumped 88 percent over the previous year.

EV market share will jump even more in 2022. Tesla could sell 1.5 million EVs alone, and China's BYD expects to sell 1.2 million. Ford has 200,000 preorders for the electric version of the best-selling automobile in America, the F-150. GM will release the electric Hummer pickup this year.

Automakers have pledged more than $100 billion to EV development. Battery makers are developing new chemistries and designs. Miners are finding new sources of raw materials. And entrepreneurs are developing new tools to improve efficiency across the supply chain.

EV makers are on pace to match the manufacturing cost of internal combustion vehicles by 2023. Once an EV purchase price is on par, the main differential will be range and refueling time. Since most people drive less than 40 miles a day, EVs will be more economical for most uses.

Road trippers will not have to wait long, though. Tesla already offers a 400-mile range, Lucid's first model this year has a 520-mile range, and Mercedes this week announced a new sedan with a 630-mile battery.

Oil companies, meanwhile, face only rising costs as crude reserves become more expensive to access and governments consider taxing carbon, adding to fuel costs.

Widespread adoption of EVs does not spell the end of the oil business. Some industries, such as aviation, will be difficult to decarbonize. People also tend to hold on to their vehicles for a decade or more, which means replacing all internal combustion engines will take generations.

TOMLINSON'S TAKE: Don't fall for Big Oil's propaganda on the future of energy

The wildcard for the oil industry is the weather. Almost every community has experienced or witnessed an extraordinary climate event in 2021. More places will experience deadly droughts, freak storms, extraordinary flooding, or fierce fires as the planet grows warmer.

Fossil fuel advocates argue their product lifts people out of poverty by supplying cheap energy. But how many people who experience climate change firsthand will stick with a product that destroys homes and livelihoods?

Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Phasing down our oil consumption only makes sense, both for the environment and our pocketbooks.

We need oil companies to keep pumping crude and delivering affordable fuels, for now. Big Oil can be part of the problem or join the transition to clean energy and sustain relevance. But the energy shift is unstoppable.","{'uri': 'houstonchronicle.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Houston Chronicle'}",[],https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/23/36/57/21883885/3/rawImage.jpg,-0.02745098039215688,,False,0,-0.02745098039215688,379074060,1

Alternatives to Consider,"SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, are companies with no commercial operations and form an alternative path to an initial public offering (IPO). They are created strictly to raise capital through an IPO to acquire an existing company. Also called a blank-check company, a SPAC is a shell company that raises money and trades on a stock exchange.

Even the hype can't veil what's really happening with SPACs, though investors still seem to want to dip their toes into the SPAC pool. The numbers show that most SPACs don't sail above and beyond expectations. In fact, an index of 25 companies that became public as the result of combining with a SPAC underperformed on the S&P 500 Index by more than 50 percentage points in 2021, according to Bloomberg.

What's lying in wait for SPACs in 2022? Let's find out, as well as some alternative options you may want to consider.

Let's untangle a few quick facts about SPACs.

Why the rise in popularity? More than 500 U.S.-listed SPACs have completed IPOs and are searching for a company to take public, according to Bloomberg. SPACs can offer a faster timeline, the ability to market the company's projections with public investors and the potential for greater proceeds than companies can get through an IPO. Finally, another perk: the management team and sponsor remains as a shareholder after the merger.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made stricter regulation of SPACs a priority. The SEC is investigating a handful of SPACs, including DraftKings, an American daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting operator, over its acquisition of SBTech, a sports betting technology provider based in Bulgaria. As another example, the SEC is also investigating Clover Health, a Medicare Advantage insurer, over violations based on the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a breach of company leaders' fiduciary duties.

The list goes on and on of other companies that have been investigated by the SEC. In December, electric vehicle startup Lucid Motors Inc. received an SEC subpoena about projections and statements from its SPAC deal. The merger valued Lucid at roughly $24 billion.

SEC investigations will likely continue to heat up regarding misleading disclosures which aren't allowed when companies go the traditional IPO route.

In the past two years, more SPACs have gone public than ever. This leads critics to say the pressure to get deals done before deadlines to return money to investors means transactions will get riskier or more expensive.

Not sure about investing in SPACs in 2022? You can still get in on the hype by thinking creatively. Consider two different ways to invest in newly formed companies.

If you want diversified exposure through a broad portfolio, why not consider SPAC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) instead? Investing in an ETF may reduce your overall risk and may give you access to an ETFs' diversity, tax-efficiency and liquidity.

In a direct listing, also called a direct public offering (DPO), a private company goes public by selling shares on stock exchanges without intermediaries. (An IPO requires a roadshow and underwriters, which can cost a lot of money for the company, which is one of the reasons some companies decide to avoid IPOs.)

Check out a few well-known companies that have opted for a DPO instead of an IPO: Asana, Palantir, Thryv, Roblox, SquareSpace and ZipRecruiter.

A direct listing takes away the need for underwriting, investment banks or a roadshow, which saves the company time and money and allows shareholders to sell their stake in the company as soon as it goes public. This effectively eliminates the holding period that comes with an IPO. Is a DPO risk free? Hardly.

In fact, there's often huge volatility because the listing does not use investment banks to underwrite the stocks and is completely dependent on market demand. For example, if no employees or investors want to sell their shares, then no transactions will occur because the range in which the stock is traded is less predictable.

Investors were crazy for SPACs in 2020 and 2021, but the amount of cash raised has underperformed expectations in the past two quarters.

The fact of the matter is that traditional IPOs mean that companies must offer up ample disclosures to both regulators and investors, which offers protections that don't come with SPACs (though it's true that the information goes on the S-4 when the SPAC merges). The result: Investors invest too much for shares not advertised like they should have been.

That's why the SEC has gotten involved, and it has already slowed SPACs, which is the direct opposite of how everyone intended. Direct listings also have safety challenges, because, like SPACs, they try to come out from under the long IPO process with the end result of saving money, though with an albeit more uncertain outcome.

Carefully consider whether IPOs, SPACs or DPOs make more sense for your situation (or another type of investment entirely) and never invest more money than you can afford to lose.","{'uri': 'marketbeat.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Market Beat'}",[],http://marketbeat.com/images/marketbeat-logo-400-400.png?v=2020b,0.07450980392156858,,True,0,0.07450980392156858,379072260,3

Mercedes-Benz has unveiled an electric concept car, Vision EQXX, which it says will be capable of exceeding a range of 1,000 km on a single charge.

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today's Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.)

The German automaker said it plans to take the range and efficiency of electric vehicles (EV) to a new level that will make them suitable for every journey.

""The Mercedes-Benz VISION EQXX is how we imagine the future of electric cars,"" Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kallenius said.

The concept car uses less than 10 kWh of electrical energy to travel 100 km. When translated into fossil-fuel consumption, this is around 1 litre per 100 km, Mercedes noted. Tesla's Model S 60 consumes 18.1 kWh per 100 km, which equates to about 2 litre per 100 km in fossil-fuel consumption, according to the company.

Vision EQXX's battery pack holds almost 100 kWh of energy, with an energy density of close to 400 Wh/l, and weighs around 495 kg. It has 50% less volume and is 30% lighter than the battery pack in the automaker's EQS electric sedan.

In addition to the battery, the electric system that powers many of the ancillaries in the prototype draws extra energy from 117 solar cells on the roof. This can add up to 25 km of range, according to Mercedes.

The concept car was developed by Mercedes' R&D centres together with engineers from its Formula 1 and Formula E programmes. The development process, which took about 18 months, included advances across all elements of its electric drivetrain as well as the use of lightweight engineering, resulting in a vehicle that weighs around 1,750 kg.

The Vision EQXX's 1,000 km range means it can be used to travel from Berlin to Paris on a single charge. During recent testing, the automaker's EQS 450+ electric sedan completed nearly 680 km on one charge. Then there are other EVs available in the market from companies like Lucid and Tesla with ranges up to 840 km and 650 km respectively.

Last year, Mercedes announced that it will go all-electric by 2030. The carmaker said it will have battery EVs in all segments by 2022, and from 2025 onwards, all newly launched vehicle architectures will be electric-only. Additionally, it committed about $47 billion in investments into EVs between 2022 and 2030.","{'uri': 'thehindu.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Hindu'}",[],https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/w1ov77/article38124347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mercedes-Vision-EQXX,0.1843137254901961,eng-7384949,False,0.7215686440467834,0.1843137254901961,379068780,1

Part of his outlook was Lucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID), one of the most intriguing electric vehicle stocks currently in the market. Even though Lucid is still a relatively new company, many investors are looking past this, and CNBC's Cramer doesn't think it's a good idea. 7 photos According to NASDAQ, Lucid Motors' stock has risen more than 68% in the last three months. The EV automaker's stocks skyrocketed after a merger earlier in the year with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Churchill Capital Corp IV but later gave up most of its gains. However, the stock rose again due to specific short-term catalysts.

Cramer quickly pointed out that many investors are out for the next Tesla, and Lucid seems like a viable option. However, he cautioned investors that Lucid Motors is still in the early stages of scaling up production.

The California-based electric vehicle company started commercial production in September and announced the kick-off of its Lucid Air electric sedan deliveries in late October. Peter Rawlinson, Lucid Motors CEO, told CNBC that the EV start-up has plans to build factories in the Middle East and China.

In 2021, Lucid Group shares rose 280%. ""Mad Money"" host feels the timing is incorrect, especially with another lockup expiration coming later in the month. ""As much as I love the story, I hate the timing."" He said.

After a successful launch of the Lucid Air, the California-based EV start-up will also bring an SUV called Gravity into its lineup in 2023. While both these announcements got a pompous reception, NASDAQ warns that investors need to be aware of the company's high volatility before investing any money into it.

NASDAQ InvestorPlace segment also noted that it is worth considering there are not many near-term catalysts left for investors to exploit. Therefore, Lucid stock will continue meandering before the penny drops, and as a result, the shares might experience previous lows.","{'uri': 'autoevolution.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'autoevolution'}","[{'uri': 'humphrey_bwayo@autoevolution.com', 'name': 'Humphrey Bwayo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/mad-money-host-jim-cramer-cautions-investors-about-lucid-stock-178292_1.jpg,0.01960784313725483,eng-7381244,False,0.7529411911964417,0.01960784313725483,379067160,16

Viktor Orbn is special - ExBulletin,"Hungarian autocrat Viktor Orbn was the first outgoing head of state to support Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016. Now Trump is returning the favor.

Viktor Orbn of Hungary really loves his country and wants the safety of his people, Trump wrote January 3 in an endorsement of Orbns' candidacy for re-election in the Hungarian presidential race to be held in April or May of this year. He is a strong leader and respected by all.

Early in Trump's political career, his praise of an authoritarian leader would have raised eyebrows. His admiration for Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un at first upset and infuriated Republicans. But after years of defending despots around the world, Trump's embrace of authoritarians has become a defining feature of his foreign policy. From Jair Bolsonaro to Orbn, Trump has become the leader of a group of cunning and ""soft"" authorities who delegitimize elections, demonize the press, and take a xenophobic approach to immigration.

I've spoken to authoritarian experts to understand why Trump's endorsement of Orbn isn't just more flattery.

Trump is known to have publicly praised authoritarians, from Turkish Recep Tayyip Erdoan to Chinese Xi Jinping. Does that say the silent aloud part of the authoritarians is sticking together?

It's no secret that Trump has a soft spot for authoritarians, and he has already shown his support for autocrats facing re-election. In 2020, Trump backed Polish President Andrzej Duda, who militarized homophobia to fuel his campaign. He continued the practice even after he stepped down and supported Brazilian far-right President Jair Bolsonaro in October 2021. Brazil is lucky to have a man like Jair Bolsonaro working for them, Trump wrote.

Trump admitted he saw himself in Orbn. According to David Cornstein, who served as US ambassador to Hungary during the Trump administration, the former president compared Orbn to a twin brother when the two leaders met in 2019.

Trump rightly believes that Orbn is fighting the same forces Trump fought in America: democratic institutions, a free press, an independent judiciary, ethical rules, and opponents who always try to insist on democracy and Right wing state. Birds of a feather come together, said Brian Klaas, associate professor of world politics at University College London and author of How to Rig an Election.

Have other former US presidents supported foreign leaders?

Yes. Former President Obama approved Emmanuel Macron in 2017 during the French presidential election which pitted Macron against the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. But it is not common practice for a US president to support a candidate in a foreign election after he leaves office.

Are there elements of the Hungarian authoritarian style reflected in Trump's way of governing?

Bosses learn from each other, Klaas wrote to me in an email. Their textbooks are inspired by similar tactics: attacking the press, demonizing opponents, especially if they are from ethnic or religious minorities, engaging in nepotism and cronyism, undermining the rule of law, stealing, blaming your opponents. for the things you are guilty of, and trying to overturn free and fair elections.

All of this is characteristic of both Orbn and Trump.

What about the GOP more broadly?

The embrace of Hungarian authoritarianism is not confined to Trump. It's a facet of the GOP, argues David Pepper, former Ohio Democratic Party chairman and author of Authoritarian Labs.

Hungary is a competitive authoritarian country where the facade of democracy hides an autocratic reality. Elections are held, but districts are heavily gerrymandered and postal voting rules favor Orbns supporters. The government controls the national election agency and fills the courts with conservative allies.

Pepper sees similar patterns in the United States. He underlines Ohio, where Republicans in the state legislature pushed to change the electoral process so that judges require party identification of candidates on the ballot. Or Wisconsin and Georgia where Republicans fought to gain control of state election commissions.

Orbn's hallmark of competitive authoritarianism is a system where they cling to maintaining an appearance of legitimacy while predetermining all outcomes, Pepper said. And that's, I think, the closest parallel to what we see in so many states, and if those states and people like Trump had what they wanted, what we would see nationally.

It is no coincidence that Hungary shares undemocratic strategies like gerrymandering with the United States. In fact, Hungarian autocrats have learned from the GOP, says Szabolcs Panyi, a Hungarian investigative reporter for the independent Direct36 newsroom.

I think that Orbn learned a lot from Republican policies and also especially from specialists of the Republican image. So it was Orbn who imported and implemented Republican tactics in Hungarian politics, and not the other way around, Panyi said.

Others in Trump's inner circle have recently been friendly towards Orbn. Tucker Carlson took a trip to Hungary last summer where his interview with Orbn made headlines. What does that say about the GOP and Trumpism right now?

Trump's support for Orbn ahead of the Hungarian election goes beyond his praise of Bolsonaro or Putin, Klaas argues. The authoritarian Republican base made Orbn something of a folk hero, he said. They created a mock caricature of Orbn as a sort of conservative who defends Western values, rather than a racist, anti-Semitic authoritarian who uses state power to destroy dissent while getting rich steadily.

In August 2021, Tucker Carlson took his viewers to Hungary to show what he claimed to be an example of conservative nationalism. In a full week of coverage and one-on-one interviews with Orbn himself, Carlson praised the immigration crackdown and the pro-family stance that has fostered blatantly homophobic policies.

Visiting the Hungarian capital in September 2021, former vice-president Mike Pence rented Orbns restrictive abortion policies.

Hungary has become the new model for the GOP in terms of racist population policy and electoral autocracy, said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, professor of history at New York University and author of Lucid, a newsletter on threats to democracy.

It's no coincidence, according to Ben-Ghiat, that the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the annual gathering of American conservatives, will be held in Budapest later this year.

What is the message that Trump and his entourage are sending?

In a way, Trump also endorses his own brand of authoritarianism, argues Pepper, the former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party.

I think that says they're all in this form of government, he said. This legitimizes Orbn, but it also legitimizes this form of politics.

Pepper is concerned that U.S. conservatives are taking notes on Orbn's authoritarian strategy. Tucker Carlsons visit to Hungary, the upcoming CPAC conference in Budapest, and Trump's endorsement are all signs the Tories are exploring how they can build something here where they have a minority party and a worldview locked in power. by a competitive Orbn-style autocracy.

Hungarians will not be swayed to vote for Orbn because of Trump's endorsement. So what does this mean for Hungary?

Hungary's presidential election between Orbn and the opposition is close, but it's hard to imagine anyone on the fence going to be convinced by Trump's endorsement. But that doesn't mean approval is unimportant.

Orbn has few allies in the European Union, and prior to the Trump administration, the Hungarian government was also at odds with the United States. But due to Trump's public support, Orbn can claim he has allies who share his autocratic worldview, according to Panyi, the Hungarian journalist.

This is material that Orbn and his people can use to fuel their propaganda, saying Oh, even Trump is backing us, Panyi said. He can still present himself as having some kind of support from influential people. But in reality, Trump is no longer in power, he added.

Hungary is a small country with a population the size of Michigan. But the support of a former US president allows Orbn to claim legitimacy and relevance on the international scene. Think of it this way: do you think Trump knows the name of the president of Estonia? Absolutely not. The fact that Trump knows Orbn shows that Hungary is exceeding its geopolitical clout, and Orbn and his supporters will try to exploit that to their political advantage, said Klaas, a political scientist at University College London.

So will Trump's endorsement add additional votes for Orbn? Probably not. But let's say the elections don't go the way Orbn wants them to. By refusing to accept the results of the 2020 U.S. election, Trump has created a roadmap for authoritarians to claim an unfavorable election was rigged. This intimate relationship between Orbn and Trump could set the stage for the Hungarian autocrat to make the same argument, said Orsolya Lehotai, a doctoral student in the policy department of the New School for Social Research. He basically endorses aspects of what happens when a political leader accuses his opponents of cheating with an election, Lehotai said.","{'uri': 'exbulletin.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ExBulletin'}",[],https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Orban-Trump-endorsement.jpeg,0.3725490196078431,eng-7380575,False,0.4588235318660736,0.3725490196078431,379065240,1

Chief executive Peter Rawlinson had said in October 2021 that the launch of the Lucid Air sedan was set to happen in the Middle East and Europe in 2022 and China in 2023.

Last month, the company received a subpoena from the US securities regulator seeking documents related to an investigation into its blank-check deal.","{'uri': 'rte.ie', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'RTE.ie'}",[],https://img.rasset.ie/00183ce3-1600.jpg,0.1450980392156862,,True,0,0.1450980392156862,379062960,6

The girl and the mirror-a subject that is older than history, older than time. The feminine form and the mirror belongs also to the art of a movement that would become traced from realism to the novel trend known as Modernism and beyond.

In that vein it is good to look at two Bengal Masters years apart- the former Director/Curator of National Gallery of Modern Art, author, essayist and sculptor Prodosh Das Gupta, and Jogen Chowdhury the famed Professor from Kala Bhavan Santiniketan. Both these masters have created drawings on the same subject.

Das Gupta's lucid lines

Prodosh Das Gupta's Untitled 1978 drawing created in Shantiniketan, of the woman and the mirror is lithe and lucid; it hints at subtle, yet different artistic styles and aesthetic responses. Das Gupta created his drawings with a sculptural intensity as he reflected retroactively, certain literary and artistic trends at the beginning of the twentieth century. In his drawing, we sense the erotic aura as well as the flight from the conventions of realism, and the adoption of the simplicity of fluid forms and styles in the modernist period. His is a minimalist rendering.

The feminine form's smoothly delineated profile, in delicately lithe lines, creates allusions to youth and old age, light and shadow all compressed into a single multivalent female form seated in graceful seduction. Das Gupta brings forward the age-old debate in which the nude is created with verve and vivacity, where it is not debased but it is presented as an embodiment of gentle beauty and languorous lyricism.

Sculpted strokes

In Jogen Chowdhury's 2020 drawing, of a luscious full-bodied, seated, feminine form we see a voluptuous, sculpted identity in which parallel strokes of contouring are undertaken to provide new meaning, to illuminate the female form in a different way, and to show different relationships within the observed world. For Chowdhury modernism rejected traditions that existed in the nineteenth century and sought to stretch the boundaries to find a new distinct language.

Chowdhury, creates his feminine form with a dazzling, visual and thematic complexity. In taking the primary subject of the time-honoured artistic theme of a woman and her mirror, he reinvents the composition in strikingly modern terms.Erotic elements surge, his detailing of her hair in a bun and the finely attuned attention to limbs in the frontal visage all add to a charisma that churns moments of moody edits.","{'uri': 'timesofindia.indiatimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Times of India'}","[{'uri': 'uma_nair@timesofindia.indiatimes.com', 'name': 'Uma Nair', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/042-scaled.jpg,0.1843137254901961,,False,0,0.1843137254901961,379062360,3

Will it carry on forever?

The sky-high valuations of companies such as Arrival, Canoo, Lucid, Nio and even Tesla are already deflating. Of 23 electric vehicle manufacturer stocks tracked by the Financial Times in a chart entitled Electric Bubble Watch, all are down on their peaks, some by more than 70% as we went to print (including Arrival, Faraday Future, Lordstown and Workhorse).

In one crazy moment this year, Tesla was valued at more than the next nine largest manufacturers while selling fewer vehicles than Isuzu.

If you organise global car makers based on their market capitalisation (the combined price of publicly and privately held stock), Tesla still comes way out in front of Toyota, with a $1 trillion (£750 billion) valuation in a snapshot taken on 7 December. But are we entering a phase where the stock valuation begins to align more closely with the physical realities of the start-ups?

After Toyota comes Chinese EV and battery maker BYD, and then in sixth, ahead of General Motors, is electric car, truck and van maker Rivian, at $87bn (£65.7bn). California- based luxury EV maker Lucid is eighth, at $78bn (£58.9bn), just ahead of Ford at $76bn (£57.4bn). Chinese EV maker Nio is 14th, ahead of Honda. And Fisker, another Californian effort, ranks 36th, at $5.2bn (£3.9bn), ahead of Mazda.

The catalyst for this pricing was of course Tesla, which genuinely disrupted the global car market.

No one else making EVs is close, reckons Patrick Hummel, head of European car research for investment bank UBS.

""In 2021, Tesla has gapped away further from all others in terms of volume growth and [profit] margins, and its lead should be undisputed in 2022,"" he wrote in an analyst's note.","{'uri': 'autocar.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Autocar'}",[],https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/99_rivian.jpg,0.04313725490196085,,False,0,0.04313725490196085,379059120,3

You can't buy it today, but a modified Tesla Model S drove that distance across Michigan last month. It was the work of a two-year-old Michigan startup, Our Next Energy (ONE), which says it is aiming to make safer and more sustainable batteries. ONE retrofitted the car with a battery holding twice the energy of Tesla's original -- while fitting entirely within the same space. It's a proof of concept for the company's own future battery design.

Faster Charging, or Bigger Batteries?

Two ways exist to assuage range anxiety among EV buyers. The first is ubiquitous, reliable, nationwide DC fast charging, like Tesla's Supercharger network. Unfortunately, only Tesla offers that today. Every other EV relies on a mishmash of private networks of varying reliabilities.

The second is to improve the range of EVs by a combination of large-capacity batteries and improving their efficiency. That's the approach used by the Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX, an ultra-efficient concept EV that was just unveiled Monday. Its goal is to provide 620 miles of range in a luxury sedan.

ONE's project didn't mess with anything to alter the Model S's efficiency, but employed a much higher-capacity battery. ""We want to accelerate the adoption of EVs by eliminating range anxiety, which holds back consumers today,"" said ONE founder and CEO Mujeeb Ijaz. He's a battery engineer with more than 30 years' experience, including stints at Apple, A123 Systems, Ford, and others.

ONE put its higher-capacity prototype pack into a Tesla Model S Long Range Plus, providing nearly 90 percent more range than its original 402-mile EPA figure. The demonstration car is actually the same vehicle (before ONE modified it) that won our EV 1000 long-range trip last spring. In our own highway range test last May, that car achieved 320 miles at a steady 75 mph, the farthest distance we've recorded. (That model has since been supplanted by the Model S Long Range, rated at 405 miles.)

The original Tesla battery had a capacity of 103.9 kilowatt-hours, while the prototype ONE battery that replaced it in the same space has 207.3 kWh. CEO Ijaz confirmed to C/D that ONE used ""a single pack retrofitted in the same space as the original battery."" So it's far more energy-dense, but delivered consumption (in miles per kWh) roughly equal to that of the original battery.

ONE's drive took place in mid-December in Michigan -- with chilly winter temperatures working against range maximization -- where the company drove up and down the length of the mitten state for nearly 14 hours, averaging 55 mph, before winding up back at its Novi headquarters in southeastern Michigan with the trip odometer showing 752.2 miles. Later, in a much less taxing test, the company put the Model S on a dynamometer at a steady 55 mph, where it ran for a staggering 882 miles on a charge.

The company dubs its prototype a proof of concept. The point is to show that real-world ranges far longer than an average driver's endurance (pit stops, ahem) can be achieved in the near future. The next step is for it to evolve into a new battery called Gemini, intended to go into production after 2023.

ONE says it focuses on battery chemistries that are ""safer"" and ""sustainable,"" using a ""conflict-free supply chain."" In practice, that means lithium iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which historically has energy density 30 percent lower than cobalt- or nickel-based chemistries (and, unfortunately, reportedly cold-weather issues). Its first product, Aries, will go into production late this year. It's a battery using prismatic LFP cells in a structural cell-to-pack architecture without separate modules, packing more cells into the pack to lower the energy disadvantage against cobalt cells.

One Battery, Two Cell Types

For Gemini, the company plans to supplement the lower-cost LFP cells with a range-extender portion of the battery for extreme power needs, to reduce stress and deterioration in the bulk of the pack. Range-extender cells will use an anode modified to eliminate graphite, which the company says ""makes more volume available for the cathode"" to boost the energy density of the range-extender cells.

The cathode will be made of a proprietary material rich in manganese that ONE says can be sustainably sourced at low cost. (The company has so far applied for 14 patents related to the Gemini pack.) The LFP cells cover 99 percent of the vehicle's duty cycle, Ijaz told C/D, and the range extender is used for just 1 percent.

As a proof of concept, however, the prototype pack used in the demonstration was powered by different cells. The capacity of more than 200 kilowatt-hours was provided by high-energy cobalt-nickel cells, while those intended for the Gemini line are still under development.

The point of this test, then, wasn't about ONE's future plans for new cells. Instead, it was to show that it's possible to pack considerably more energy into a battery the same size as today 's -- without, for instance, double-stacking a pair of packs, as GM is doing in its 2022 GMC Hummer EV.

Headlines about EVs with 752 miles of range, or the EQXX's target of 620 miles, or the 520 miles of the 2022 Lucid Air version now being delivered, should go a long way to reassure nervous buyers. People will start to believe that EVs capable of very long ranges are possible -- even if they end up opting for a more affordable 300-mile alternative in the end.

Ijaz, a 30-year industry veteran, is a former senior executive at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and A123 Systems, where he led teams developing battery systems for electric vehicles.

For ONE's Gemini battery, Ijaz said: ""We want to eliminate both nickel and cobalt, but we don't want to give up energy density. We aim to re-invent battery chemistry as well as the cell architecture"" in order to provide at least 750 miles of range between charges.

""If you put that much energy on board, you are ready for anything the customer asks - a round trip from Detroit to Chicago, or towing a trailer.""

ONE's range target is well beyond even the best of current electric vehicles, including the Lucid Air, which offers just over 500 miles of range in the top version.

Ijaz said ONE chose a Tesla Model S to showcase its prototype battery because ""it has fairly high efficiency and a fairly large battery pack"" which provided enough space to fit ONE's battery.

The testing was done in a road test across Michigan in late December, at an average speed of 55 miles per hour, ONE said.","{'uri': 'investing.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Investing.com'}",[],https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPEI0404M_M.jpg,0.2941176470588236,,True,0.6078431606292725,0.2941176470588236,379056600,1

Gusty winds will whip the snow around with the lowest visibility across the open fields of greater Minnesota. Travel will be slow with plowable snowfall amounts and winds gusting to near 40 mph. Be careful out there today.

Maya Angelou had it right: If you don t like something, change it. If you can t change it, change your attitude. Don t complain. And yet and yet: we are genetically engineered to complain, which often makes things better.

Weather is an exception. As proud as I am of my Doppler, I can't do a thing to stop arctic air.

Not yet.

The latest Siberian Spanking whips up plowable snow today (maybe 3-5"" with more north of MSP). Measuring that snow may be problematic as winds gust to near 40 mph, creating blowing and drifting, with ground blizzards over much of Minnesota. Take it easy out there.

Temperatures hold below zero Thursday and much of Friday before rebounding to near freezing Saturday. The latter half of next week looks relatively mild, but a few more subzero swipes are likely in mid and late January.

Going way out on a fragile limb I suspect most of the subzero air this winter will come in January, not February, like it did last winter. Just a hunch. No prolonged Polar Vortex signature showing up yet.

Probably Plowable - But Good Luck Measuring the Snow. It may be harder than usual figuring out exactly how much snow fell with considerable blowing and drifting today. ECMWF and 3KM NAM has bumped up expected snowfall amounts into the 3-5"" range, with a little more than that over central Minnesota.

Mostly Brisk. A few more subzero relapses are likely - one coming Thursday and early Friday; another bump of frozen air early next week. Saturday will feel OK with temperatures climbing to near 30F, but any sense of warmth will be illusory. Today's snowfall will probably be the last accumulating snow looking out a week or more.

Some Moderation Third Week of January? Insert additional question marks here. We'll see a few days in the low 30s the latter half of next week, and GFS guidance suggests more of a Pacific vs. Arctic flow returning for much of the USA the last 10 days of January. We'll see.

Top Five 2021 Weather Events in Minnesota. The Minnesota DNR State Climatology Office has the official list, including the top meteorological story of last year: ""...#1 Historic Mid-December Severe Weather and Wind Event, December 15-16, 2021. This runaway #1 would have been a top-five candidate any time of year, but its out-of-season timing, as much as its potency, made it a ""career"" or ""generational"" event that had never before been recorded in Minnesota. A powerful cyclone brought warm air, high dew point temperatures and summer-like severe weather into Minnesota. As of December 29, twenty tornadoes have been confirmed, the strongest of which, rated EF-2, struck the town of Hartland in Freeborn County. Damaging thunderstorm winds tracked across several states and qualified as a ""derecho,"" and the same system brought additional damaging non-thunderstorm winds due to the pressure gradient. The warm air out ahead of the storm brought the fastest snow melt seen in December in the Twin Cities. The snow depth went from 12 inches on December 11 to zero on the 16th...""

2021's Worst 10 Disasters Caused $170+ Billion Insured Losses: Climate Nexus has headlines and links: ""The ten worst extreme weather disasters in 2021 caused more than $170 billion in insured losses, according to a report from Christian Aid, a UK NGO. The full costs are certainly higher, however, because the $170.3 billion does not account for impacts not covered by insurance. The damages represent the rising cost of climate change as it worsens extreme weather, like Hurricane Ida which caused $65 billion in insured losses. ""The costs of climate change have been grave this year, both in terms of eyewatering financial losses but also in the death and displacement of people around the world,"" report author Kat Kramer said in a statement. ""Be it storms and floods in some of the world's richest countries or droughts and heatwaves in some of the poorest, the climate crisis hit hard in 2021."" In addition to Hurricane Ida, the report tallied costs of the European flooding, the Texas winter storm, flooding in China's Henan Province, British Columbia flooding, April's French wine freeze, and Cyclone Tauktae.""

Historic US Weather Events in 2021, by the Numbers. Capital Weather Gang examines the biggest extreme-weather stories of last year: ""From record-shattering heat to frigid waves of cold, torrential downpours to relentless drought, 2021 has been a year of extremes in the United States. As personal stories and images illuminate the devastation wrought by the events, the raw numbers also underline the widespread impacts and extraordinary nature of this year's weather...The United States experienced 18 billion-dollar weather disasters in the first nine months of 2021, totaling more than $104 billion. Driven largely by severe thunderstorms and a relentless hurricane season, this year has so far seen the second-most billion-dollar disasters of any year since 1980, and it could surpass 2020 for the record when events from October, November and December are tallied...""

We Can Build Homes to Survive Tornadoes. We Just Haven't. An Op-Ed at The Washington Post (paywall) caught my eye; here's a clip: ""...No one believes all tornado damage can be avoided. But most tornadoes -- more than 95 percent -- have ground-level wind speeds of 135 miles per hour or less. Researchers from Texas Tech University who conducted the post-tornado surveys in Lubbock stated that while best estimates suggested maximum wind speeds at ground level were 200 miles per hour, most of the damage was caused by winds in the range of 75 to 125 miles per hour. With better building construction, we can narrow the width of the most catastrophic destruction -- the distance away from the tornado's centerline -- so that homes, while possibly experiencing damage, remain occupiable immediately after a tornado. For a house to withstand wind loads, which pull up against the building's structure and away from the ground against gravity, they must have strong, continuous lines of mechanical connections that tie every component, from the roof through the walls, down to the foundation...""

The Causal Effect of Environmental Catastrophe on Long-Run Economic Growth from 6,700 Cyclones. A new paper at NBER highlights the ""long-tail"" effect of tropical cyclones on local economies; here's an excerpt of the summary: ""... Income losses arise from a small but persistent suppression of annual growth rates spread across the fifteen years following disaster, generating large and significant cumulative effects: a 90th percentile event reduces per capita incomes by 7.4% two decades later, effectively undoing 3.7 years of average development. The gradual nature of these losses render them inconspicuous to a casual observer, however simulations indicate that they have dramatic influence over the long-run development of countries that are endowed with regular or continuous exposure to disaster. Linking these results to projections of future cyclone activity, we estimate that under conservative discounting assumptions the present discounted cost of ""business as usual"" climate change is roughly $9.7 trillion larger than previously thought...""

The Wild Idea to End Droughts by Triggering Artificial Rain. The Daily Beast focuses on the difficulties of nudging Mother Nature one way or another: ""...Studies have shown cloud seeding may increase precipitation by anywhere from 5 to 15 percent. Friedrich cautions, however, that this can vary wildly, and we still don't have a great sense of what interfering with condensation and precipitation in the atmosphere will actually lead to. ""Once you manipulate the cloud, you don't really know what this cloud would have produced in terms of precipitation without the manipulation,"" Friedrich said. ""It's really important to run models where you can maybe simulate the impact of these different technologies...""

How to Prepare for Power Outages. A post at WIRED.com (paywall) has some good advice; here's a clip: ""...The worst part of an outage is when night falls, and in the winter months that can come early in the evening. Without power your place is enveloped in darkness, and basic tasks like just walking to the kitchen can result in slips, bumps, and unnecessary injury in general. The first thing I keep on hand -- in strategic places around the house -- are LED lanterns. They're low-cost, use very little power, and can go for months without having to replace the batteries. Keep one near a stairwell or on the kitchen counter so you can navigate your now-enshrouded home safely. And if you need to go somewhere else in the house? They're portable. While being able to traverse your own place safely is important, the secondary effect is eliminating the need for the flashlight app on your phone, which is usually a battery vampire...""

The 20 Best EVs Coming in 2022. WIRED.com takes a look at a new crop of all-electric options, and the variety will just keep on growing over time: ""...To say the Lightning electric pickup truck is a huge deal for Ford is, frankly, putting it mildly. After all, the regular internal-combustion F-150 has been the best-selling vehicle of any kind in the US for over 40 years. This may explain why the look has largely been left untouched. However, everything else has changed. Some 563 hp and 775 pound-feet of torque are provided by dual electric motors.

Climate Stories...

To Fight Climate Change, First You Have to Measure It. A post at WIRED.com (paywall) is a worthy read: ""From devastating wildfires to polar bears clinging to melting ice floes, there's no shortage of shocking images to illustrate the need for action on climate change. But collecting reliable data to track the rate of change -- and help determine how to tackle it -- is much less straightforward. Scientists at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, South West London, are using precise monitoring equipment to measure pollutants and track our impact on the planet more accurately than ever before. The lab's latest tool is Boreas, a laser spectrometer designed to collect and analyze methane -- a greenhouse gas emitted by dozens of human activities, from agriculture to burning fuel. At an unassuming telecommunications tower in Heathfield, Surrey, Boreas works 24 hours a day in all weather conditions to sample large volumes of air...""

Climate Satire 'Don't Look Up' Tops Netflix: I've seen the movie and it strikes the right tone when it comes to science-denial, something climate scientists have been dealing with for decades. Climate Nexus has details and links: ""Netflix's star-studded satirical climate allegory Don't Look Up debuted for streaming on Christmas Eve as the platform's top movie. Reactions were mixed about the thinly-veiled allegorical saga of politicians ignoring scientists about the threat of an impending planet-killing comet before a tech billionaire tries to mine it. The volume of discourse generated by the film -- fueled in part by a cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett, and Meryl Streep -- illustrates popular culture demand for art and media on the climate crisis.""

Climate Change is Making Your Seasonal Allergies Worse, According to New Research. It seems allergy season is nearly year-round now. A post at Martha Stewart (please don't laugh) explains: ""Itching, sneezing, and watery eyes are all things you're familiar with if you struggle with seasonal allergies. While these cold-like symptoms are triggered by outdoor and indoor allergens -- think pollen and dust mites -- that are typically more rampant during spring, a new study suggests that climate change has lengthened hay fever season. The research, which was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals that global warming is causing extra weeks of seasonal allergies. To obtain their findings, the researchers analyzed measurements of airborne pollen and mold across the United States and Canada between 1990 and 2018 as documented by the National Allergy Bureau. The measurements were collected between those years and hand-counted by staff at 60 stations across both countries...""

Future Hurricanes Will Roam Over More of the Earth. YaleNews has a press release; here's an excerpt: ""A new, Yale-led study suggests the 21 century will see an expansion of hurricanes and typhoons into mid-latitude regions, which includes major cities such as New York, Boston, Beijing, and Tokyo. Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, the study's authors said tropical cyclones -- hurricanes and typhoons -- could migrate northward and southward in their respective hemispheres, as the planet warms as a result of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. 2020's subtropical storm Alpha, the first tropical cyclone observed making landfall in Portugal, and this year's Hurricane Henri, which made landfall in Connecticut, may be harbingers of such storms. ""This represents an important, under-estimated risk of climate change,"" said first author Joshua Studholme, a physicist in Yale's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and a contributing author on the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sixth assessment report published earlier this year...""

Chrysler unveiled its first pure-electric vehicle, the Airflow Concept, at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, with plans to deliver its first production battery-electric vehicle by 2025. Chrysler's future goals are even more ambitious - aiming to have a full all-electric lineup by 2028. By contrast, many manufacturers already have BEVs on the road with more coming down the pipeline soon from Volkswagen, Nissan, Ford, BMW, and new EV players like Rivian, Lucid, and Imperium - to name a few.

The move is part of a bigger commitment from parent company Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest auto maker. Stellantis plans to invest 30-billion euros ($43-billion) through 2025 on new EVs and technologies across its 14 brands, which include Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, RAM and Maserati. ""The Chrysler Airflow Concept represents the start of Chrysler's revitalization as we intend to transform clean mobility and seamlessly connected customer experiences,"" said Chris Feuell, Chrysler CEO, during the CES digital unveil.

By that point, the EV market will be saturated with new entries. General Motors, for example, plans to introduce 30 new global electric vehicles by 2025 including the all new Hummer EV, in truck and SUV forms, the all-electric Silverado pickup truck, and Cadillac Lyriq. Volkswagen is expanding its all-electric ID family with not just the ID.4, but ID.6, ID.8 three-rowed SUV, and the ID.Buzz van. Hyundai will have the Ioniq5 and a three-rowed Ioniq7. And then there's the leader of the pack with Tesla and its big plans for a Cybertruck, a roadster, a supercar, and a less expensive US$25,000 electric car - all before 2025.

The Chrysler Airflow Concept is a four-door crossover SUV with seating for four. It has all-wheel-drive capability and is powered by two 150 kWh electric drive motors, one in the front and one in the rear. The battery is expected to deliver approximately 560 - 640 kilometres of range on a single charge as well as fast-charging capabilities. Details on the battery pack capacity and horsepower haven't been released.

Penned by Stellantis's chief design officer Ralph Gilles, the Airflow Concept has a sleek, streamlined look with a low-ride height, wide track, and a slightly sloping roofline. Attractive design cues include a massive panoramic roof, beefy 22-inch wheels and tires, and an updated twist on Chrysler's famed wing logo at the front, which blends into a horizontal light blade illuminated with crystal LED lighting. Similarly, at the rear, the lighting motif continues with a crystal LED tail light running the width of the vehicle. It gives this concept a cohesive, distinctive look that's instantly recognizable.

The cabin is spacious and futuristic with large screens in the front and rear. The driver has access to a large centre infotainment screen; while the front passenger has his or her own display screen on the right and the two rear-seat passengers have individual entertainment systems attached to the back of the front headrests. The layout and technology are designed to create a connectivity hub on the road so passengers can connect their personal and work lives seamlessly in one spot. The screens can be customized and personalized to access a number of features including the navigation system, entertainment features, apps and downloads. Information on the screens can be shared with all passengers, too. Each seat even has a built-in camera, so passengers can participate in a group video conference call from the cabin. And the backbone of the user experience, which is the new electrical and electronic hardware and software dubbed STLA Brain by Chrysler, enables over-the-air software updates and Level 3 semi-autonomous driving capabilities, which will also be upgradable via over-the-air updates.

The interior is like no other Chrysler. It's filled with upscale touches including a circular crystalized start-stop button, cool ambient lighting, a unique flat-bottomed and flat-topped steering wheel, and perforated slim seats, covered in vegetable-tanned leather. Recycled materials are also used in the floor mats, fabric and carpeting in the cabin and cargo area for a more sustainable image moving forward. While the gloss black screens are a stark contrast to the Arctic White interior body, it's a nice, unexpected modern look that gives it a more premium feel, not expected in a Chrysler.

For now, Chrysler only has one plug-in vehicle, the Pacifica hybrid minivan, on the road so it has a lot riding on the Airflow Concept and its plans for an all-electric future.","{'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}",[],https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/0hSBozWQa2uLjjCvhl6K_9TWIVk=/560x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tgam/6VMZNXWF75GCZOAG2Z6627CFGM.jpg,0.1686274509803922,eng-7384614,False,0.7098039388656616,0.1686274509803922,379056000,1

ONE has focused on developing an advanced long-range battery that uses safer and more sustainable materials, while packing more energy into a smaller, less expensive package.

Ijaz, a 30-year industry veteran, is a former senior executive at Apple and A123 Systems, where he led teams developing battery systems for electric vehicles.

For ONE's Gemini battery, Ijaz said: ""We want to eliminate both nickel and cobalt, but we don't want to give up energy density. We aim to re-invent battery chemistry as well as the cell architecture"" in order to provide at least 750 miles of range between charges.

""If you put that much energy on board, you are ready for anything the customer asks - a round trip from Detroit to Chicago, or towing a trailer.""

ONE's range target is well beyond even the best of current electric vehicles, including the Lucid Air, which offers just over 500 miles of range in the top version.

Ijaz said ONE chose a Tesla Model S to showcase its prototype battery because ""it has fairly high efficiency and a fairly large battery pack"" which provided enough space to fit ONE's battery.

The testing was done in a road test across Michigan in late December, at an average speed of 55 miles per hour, ONE said.

AFP

Detained Tunisian ex-justice minister Noureddine Bhiri of the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, who is refusing food or medication after his transfer to hospital, is suspected of ""terrorism"", the interior minister said on January 3.

Bhiri, deputy president of Ennahdha - viewed by President Kais Saied as an enemy - was arrested by plain clothes officers on December 31and his whereabouts were initially unknown.

Ennahdha had played a central role in Tunisian politics until a power grab by President Kais Saied last year.

Tunisia was the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago, but civil society groups and Saied's opponents have expressed fear of a slide back to authoritarianism a decade after the revolution that toppled longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

""There were fears of acts of terrorism targeting the country's security and we had to act,"" Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine said late on January 3of the arrest.

A member of a delegation that visited Bhiri in hospital said on January 3 that he was refusing food or medication.

On January 2, activists and a former Ennahdha legislator said Bhiri was in a critical condition and facing death.

But the source said that Bhiri, 63, is ""not in critical condition for the time being"".

The source, asking not to be named, said that a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the UN rights commission visited Bhiri at hospital in the northern town of Bizerte on January 2.

He is ""lively and lucid"", and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward.

Since December 31, however, Bhiri has ""refused to take any food or medication, prompting his transfer to hospital"" two days later, the source said.

Samir Dilou, a lawyer and ex-Ennahdha member of Parliament, condemned Bhiri's arrest as ""political"" and an abuse of the justice system.

He told a Tunis news conference that he is lodging a ""kidnapping"" charge against Saied and the interior minister Charfeddine.

The interior minister said late on January 3 that evidence had been sent to the justice ministry regarding Bhiri's activities, but that the prosecution ""delayed"" action on the matter.

This, Charfeddine said, prompted him to ""quickly apply . . . judicial control"" over Bhiri, in a context where he was suspected of ""falsifying"" identity papers, including for a Syrian woman.

The interior minister said he had ""personally verified"" that the detainee was being ""treated well"".

Bhiri's wife, Saida Akremi, also a lawyer, told reporters he had suffered ""a heart attack"", and that she was being denied access to him because she refused to sign documents as demanded by security services.

Mondher Ounissi, a doctor and member of Ennahdha's executive bureau, said on January 2 that Bhiri suffers from several chronic illnesses, including diabetes and hypertension.

He has been ""deprived of his medication"" and ""his life is threatened"", Ounissi said, adding that Bhiri usually takes 16 pills a day.

The interior ministry on December 31 said that two individuals had been ordered under house arrest, without identifying them.

It said the move was a ""preventive measure dictated by the need to preserve national security"".

The anti-torture group INPT has identified the second person detained as Fathi Baldi, a former interior ministry official.

The president ""bears full responsibility for the life of Mr Bhiri"", the anti-Saied group ""Citizens against the coup"" said December 2 on Twitter.

It said he had been ""rushed to the hospital in a very serious condition"".","{'uri': 'phnompenhpost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Phnom Penh Post'}","[{'uri': 'agence_france_presse@phnompenhpost.com', 'name': 'Agence France-Presse', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/noureddine_bhiri_right_former_tunisian_justice_minister_and_deputy_president_of_the_islamist-inspired_ennahdha_party_opposed_to_president_kais_saied_noureddine_bhiri_was_arrested_last_friday._a.jpg,-0.2862745098039216,eng-7385583,False,0.800000011920929,-0.2862745098039216,379052700,1

On Monday Tesla announced that it delivered 308,600 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021, and 936,172 EVs in all of 2021, crushing analyst predictions on both counts. And while that might sound like pretty good news for the popularity of EV stocks in general, it might actually only be good news for Tesla stock in particular.

Consider: Last quarter, Lucid reported losing $524.4 million on less than $1 million in revenue as it struggled to ramp up production. On the one hand, Lucid says it has 17,000 preorders for its electric cars. On the other hand, the fact that it needs to invest in production to fulfill those orders means that Lucid will probably be losing money for quite some time. (According to analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, it will be losing money at least through 2024.)

In contrast, Tesla is both growing production and earning a profit while doing it -- so much profit, in fact, that Elon Musk says he doesn't even need government subsidies anymore, and that ""all subsidies should be eliminated.""

With each passing quarter, Tesla is racing ahead to capture more and more EV market share, while Lucid is still struggling to get out of the gate. Although I don't think we can write Lucid off in this race just yet, the longer it takes to ramp up production, the more dominant a rival Tesla is going to become.

The road ahead isn't at all clear for Lucid -- and I cannot say that the investors selling Lucid stock today are wrong to do so.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'rich_smith@fool.com', 'name': 'Rich Smith', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659881/red-stock-arrow-trending-down-on-a-blue-background.jpg,0.1764705882352942,eng-7381244,False,0.8039215803146362,0.1764705882352942,379051800,12

Track-counting luminosity measurements in low-luminosity operations are performed to study the effect of low collision rates on luminosity determination. The luminosity measured in a calibration transfer procedure using the track-counting technique is used to correct the pile-up dependence observed in ATLAS's main luminosity detector called LUCID. A search in the final state of a lepton, jets and missing transverse energy, where the final state is produced from a pair of top quarks and a spin-0 scalar/pseudoscalar mediator, is presented. A dedicated signal region is designed to target this final state in which the mediator decays into dark matter particles. The signal region covers the search in the mass plane of the mediator and the dark matter particle. Dedicated control regions are designed to estimate the top-quark background events, as well as the events where a Z boson is produced in association with the top quarks. The signal region event counts in the data have not been unblinded yet, but expected exclusion limits at 95% confidence level as a function of mediator mass are presented. Scalar and pseudoscalar mediators are expected to be excluded up to 200 and 250 GeV, respectively, for the dark matter mass of 1 GeV, and the coupling strengths of the mediator to the dark matter and Standard Model particles of 1.","{'uri': 'avhandlingar.se', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'avhandlingar.se'}",[],,0.1215686274509804,,False,0,0.1215686274509804,379050540,1

IN psychology, family problems represent a unique, but common category of adjustment disorder that makes people seek all kinds of solutions including spiritual and psychological treatments anywhere. Problems can develop in a family because of an unresolved social or medical or psychological issue in either parent, or in both or in one of their children. Parent-child problems can also create distress within a family. Lack of trust, poor communication, constant conflict, lack of closeness, sexual dysfunction, in-law intrusion and indiscipline within the family can cause family problems. These problems, if not addressed or tackled head on, can lead to broken home, divorce, extra-marital affair and stepfamily.

Iheanacho Golden's 'Brink of Collapse', a collection of three short stories, written in first person narrative presents two spellbinding tales of familial problems and another thrilling tale of academic trouble, and explores features of adolescent behaviours and youthful exuberance to educate the reader on trust, authentic hope, love, hatred, lust, confidence, self-respect and home training. The collection also deals with indecent behaviour, sexual harassment, sex-for-grade issue and assassination thereby weaving several themes together to create interesting plots with twists and turns, suspense and academic and marital tension. The dialogues in this collection are so robust and lucid.

This 111-page collection, a 2021 publication of OAK Initiative, the publishing arm of OAK Foundation, a charity organisation aimed at supporting indigent students, widows and the fatherless in Africa has the following three short stories, 'The Retrial', 'Vindication', and 'Hope'. The three stories have one thing in common - they all have happy endings.

The first story, 'The Retrial', which has its setting in Femi's household, is divided into four parts.

The story has Ebunoluwa, Femi's wife as the protagonist. They have two daughters and a son - Omotoke/Elizabeth, Modupeoluwa and Tobiloba respectively. Their marriage is at the brink of collapse due to poor communication and lack of trust. Boredom, the common cold of the psyche, has set in turning love to hatred and leading them straight to sexual dysfunction in their relationship that has produced three children. This crack in the wall of Femi's family almost allows wall-geckos access to the household. First, their eldest child, Omotoke nurses a desire for sexual experimentation and later goes for the real sexual training in Chris' house. Secondly, Femi's behaviour of coming home late with no apology to anyone leads to a suspicion of another woman outside, which later pushes Ebunoluwa to almost do the unthinkable using the opportunity of the date with her boss, Adekunle. At the end, it is improved communication that ditches the glitch of their relationship, repairs the cracked wall of the marriage, and saves the family from the brink of collapse.

'Vindication', the second and shortest story in this collection is divided into three parts. It has a university campus as its setting with Sewa Babatunde, a 400-level student, who purportedly fails ACC 412 paper, as the protagonist.Sewa who decides to query the lecturer in charge of ACC 412, Professor Emmanuel Gbadero Ajayi about the mark he allotted to her. She later meets the lecturer in his office, and to her chagrin, Professor Ajayi is a lecturer who engages female students in illicit sexual behaviour of sex-for-grade practice. But she is desperate not to have an extra year, so she strikes a deal with Professor Ajayi. Few hours after striking the deal, Professor Ajayi shuffles off the mortal coil in a suspicious manner and she becomes the prime suspect with a clear-cut motive. She is suspended from school, arrested by the police and charged to court. She is later granted bail. At the end of this thrilling story, Sewa is miraculously vindicated. The twist in this story is that his father's lawyer, Mr. Oshekun, who is defending her in the case is found to be the murderer of Professor Ajayi. The death of Professor Ajayi has a political undertone.

The third story in this collection, 'Hope', is the longest and very histrionic. It is a moving story of seven parts with two protagonists - Bankole (Baba) and Dara, one of Bankole's twin daughters. The first-person narrative style revolves around the two protagonists. While Dara narrates four parts, Bankole narrates three parts. Bankole's household is a troubled home with Ronke (Iya) suffering from postpartum psychosis, a severe mental illness characterised by extreme difficulty in responding emotionally to a new-born baby -- it can even include thoughts of harming the child. This has been with her since the birth of twins, Dara and Ladun, and the family has also been trying to cope, hoping for the best. The twins always seek refuge in their Uncle Mayowa's place whenever Iya is in crisis, leaving Baba to deal with the situation through injection, dog's tranquiliser. The twist in this story is that Baba is also found to be sick, his sickness empowers him to kill. Both parents are sick, psychologically sick, and the twins are in dangerous situation.

Iheanacho Golden's 'Brink of Collapse' has two highly tense spellbinding stories that highlight harsh realities of life and living for many families today. While the two families in 'The Retrial' and 'Hope' seem to survive the ordeals, some families out there are still battling and struggling with theirs. And what Sewa passes through in the thrilling story 'Vindication may consume any other student. Just like Iheanacho presents it in a fictional form, may God allow providence and luck to smile on every family and student passing through trials and travails now. The feeling of satisfaction and gladness the characters in the stories make the reader feel is rewarding, endearing and enduring and shows that it's possible to get through what seems impossible. I recommend this unputdownable collection to every family and female student.","{'uri': 'tribuneonlineng.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Tribune Online'}",[],https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Book-Two.jpg,-0.2941176470588235,,False,0,-0.2941176470588235,379050240,1

He was 99.

The cause of death of Cheong-Leen, a politician and businessman, yesterday morning at his home was not made public.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor praised the ""Mayor of Hong Kong"" for his contribution to education development.

Cheong-Leen was born in 1922 in Georgetown in the then British Guiana, where his father was a Chinese immigrant. His family moved to Hong Kong when he was nine. He studied at La Salle College.

""Uncle Hilton has contributed to Hong Kong in innumerable ways,"" a spokesman of the Hong Kong Council of Early Childhood Education and Services said in June last year when he retired after six years as its chairman. Cheong-Leen's condition at the time was said to be ""frail"" though he was ""alert and lucid.""

Before Cheong-Leen started his political career, he was a businessman in the import trade in 1945 and specialized in bringing in Swiss watches.

Cheong-Leen was honorary life president of the Hong Kong Watch Manufacturers Association. His company - H Cheong-Leen & Co (HK) - has been a member of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce since 1946.

Cheong-Leen cofounded the Hong Kong Civic Association, the city's oldest surviving political group, in 1954. Three years later, he joined the defunct Urban Council, which was dissolved in 1999, and became its longest continuously serving elected member - 34 years from 1957 to 1991.

That was when he was dubbed the ""Mayor of Hong Kong,"" being the first Chinese chairman of the council from 1981 to 1986.

Cheong-Leen was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1973 for six years. He was then elected to the chamber in 1985 and held a seat for close to three years.

""His relentless push for replacing the overheated, substandard rooftop schools built after 1953 resulted in the government adopting a nine-year free education program in 1978,"" the CECES said.

Cheong-Leen also called for banning child labor in factories and restaurants in Hong Kong.

He held several official titles, such as chairman of the Hong Kong Arts Development Council.

Lam, on behalf of the government, expressed her deepest sorrow for Cheong-Leen's passing and sent her condolences to his family.

""Mr Cheong-Leen had actively participated in public services for a long time ... He commanded the respect of different sectors. He was committed to community services and was particularly concerned about the development of local education,"" said Lam.

""He actively promoted the construction of schools and implementation of free education, and served in the Hong Kong Council of Early Childhood Education and Services for many years, making significant contributions to society.""

Cheong-Leen is survived by his four children. His youngest offspring, Flora Cheong-Leen, is a ballerina-turned-fashion designer.","{'uri': 'thestandard.com.hk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Standard'}",[],https://www.thestandard.com.hk/newsImage/20220105/50067910contentPhoto1.jpg,0.01960784313725483,,False,0,0.01960784313725483,379043820,1

The vehicles used are the Lucid Air Dream Edition and the Tesla Model S Plaid, and the video goes over where the two vehicles do well and where they do not so well. Motor Matchup also threw the Rivian R1T as an additional reference point for comparison in the first section.

Some of the components looked at by Motor Matchup were air resistance, rolling resistance, and even a detailed look at a few documents by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to see exactly how efficient both vehicles are supposed to be. The first thing the video dives into is road load, which are all of the negative forces that have an impact on the vehicle while it's being driven. The components are rolling resistance and air resistance. The EPA document mentioned is a road load coefficient that is published for every vehicle.

The host pointed out that these are the most accurate data available for vehicle characteristics. The reason for that is if these values are proven to be incorrect, manufacturers could face some serious fines.

The video starts with the road load of the Tesla Model S using an equation F(v)=A+Bv+Cv^2. The ABC represent the three different coefficient values Tesla provided to the EPA. F represents force at a certain speed and v represents a combination of velocity and miles per hour.

Using the data from the EPA and the above equation, the video shows that Tesla's road load for the Model S is 102.62 pounds of force.

The two vehicles used in the comparison are the Tesla Model S Plaid and the Lucid Air Dream Edition. Both vehicles have 19-inch wheels. For an additional reference point, the host also included data for the Rivian R1T.

Following the road load calculations, the video compares power consumption versus speed for both vehicles using the equation Power =Force x Velocity while using the conversion rate of one meter per second = 2.237 mph and 1 pound = 4.448 Newtons on earth. This gives another simple equation -- power in watts is equal to 4.448F*V/2.237.

Once the pound-force values were converted to power values, the video shows just how many kilowatts per hour each vehicle needs in order to overcome the road load at 60 miles per hour.

The power usage can also be used to show the efficiency value of speed versus consumption. The host converted power to watt-hours per mile:

The host pointed out that it should be noted that these values are based on the forces acting on each vehicle and not the efficiencies each vehicle is putting down to the ground. To calculate the exact range and efficiency of the car, one would need to take into account actual power and drivetrain losses when converting battery power to power that's going to the ground. He noted that these values reflect an assumption of 100% battery-to-wheel power efficiency.

The next part of the video comparison shows the calculation forces of the Tesla Model S Plaid and Lucid Air Dream Edition. Using the air resistance, rolling resistance, and power equations along with the specs of the vehicles -- such as the curb weight, coefficient of drag, and coefficient of rolling resistance -- he describes in detail in the video how he uses these calculations to come up with the values and calculations for each vehicle.

For the Tesla Model S Plaid, he calculated that the power consumption needed at a steady 60 miles per hour was 12.295 kW which was really close to the EPA's calculated power of 12.2 kW. He also calculated the range of the vehicle with the same values. If you were to drive the vehicle at a steady 60 miles per hour for just over 8 hours, this gives a range of 487 miles assuming 100% power efficiency. The EPA rating for the Plaid with 19-inch wheels is 396 miles.

For the Lucid, power consumption at a steady 60 miles per hour requires 12.46 kW to overcome forces at 60 miles per hour. This is a bit higher than the EPA's calculated power, which is 10.0 kW, so the host wanted to figure out why that is.

An important component of the efficiency equation, he emphasized, is the rolling resistance of the tires.

""Even though the wheel sizes are the same, the tires are actually pretty different. The Model S has Pirelli P-Zero with 255/45s on the front and 285/35s on the rear. That first number -- 255, 285 -- is the actual width of the tire in millimeters.

""On the Lucid, it has 245/45s all around, and so you're actually seeing 40 millimeters less of width on the rear tire and 10 millimeters less width on the front tire. Also, I'm not 100% sure on this, but I do believe the Pirelli compound on the Lucid is different from the compound on the Tesla. I think the Lucid is using some low-resistance all-season tire. That's less sticky and has less resistance than the Tesla.""

The video also covers a tire comparison between the two vehicles, a new Lucid forces calculation, and a battery comparison.

CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday broke down some of the best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 in 2021, offering his thoughts on how investors should approach them in the new year.

""Many of these Nasdaq winners have fallen out of favor and become incredibly dangerous, but the more tangible ones ... can work here,"" the ""Mad Money""' host said.

Lucid Group shares rose 280% in 2021, and Cramer said he knows many investors are justifiably looking for ""the next Tesla."" However, he cautioned that Lucid is still in the early stages of scaling up production.

""As much as I love the story, I hate the timing, especially with another lockup expiration ... coming later this month,"" he said. ""The last one crushed the stock.""

Cramer jumped to the fifth-best performer, Marvell Technology, because he discussed numbers 2-4 -- Moderna, Fortinet and Nvidia, respectively -- on Monday's episode of ""Mad Money"" as part of a segment on the top S&P 500 stocks.

For Marvell, Cramer noted he's long been a fan of the semiconductor company, which has undergone a reinvention under the leadership of President and CEO Matt Murphy. ""I think it can keep working in 2022 because this is a real company with real products and real profits. Notice, it was barely off today even as the rest of tech melted down,"" Cramer said.

Cramer said he believes investors should look to own Applied Materials, shares of which rose 82% in 2021, or one of its fellow semiconductor equipment makers such as KLA Corp. and ASML. KLA was the ninth-best performer in the Nasdaq 100, while ASML was No. 11.

Cramer cited the long-term demand trends, as semiconductors become integral to a growing number of products from cell phones to automobiles. ""Think of them as the limited arms dealers in the semiconductor cold war. I'd buy them on any dip, however shallow,"" he said.

Cramer said even though Datadog is considered a best-of-breed company in the world of cloud-based data analytics and monitoring, he believes investors are better suited in a different part of the stock market right now.

""This thing lost 8% of its value yesterday for no particular reason and then tumbled another 3.7% today. ... It's not the kind of stock you can afford to own when rates are on the rise,"" Cramer said.

Cramer said he believes Intuit -- which has TurboTax, QuickBooks and Credit Karma in its product suite -- has the best chance of any company on the list to repeat its ""terrific"" 2021 performance this year. Cramer touted Intuit's aggressive acquisition strategy in recent years and said it's become an indispensable company for small and medium-sized businesses. It rose nearly 70% in 2021.

Google-parent Alphabet saw its stock jump 65% last year. While some may say it's just catching up to its mega-cap tech peers, Cramer said the stock's story is more complicated than that. The company benefited from the rebound in advertising spending from industries such as travel, Cramer said, adding that investors are also expecting big things from the Google Cloud division.

Cramer said he's a fan of Atlassian, which makes tools for software developers, as a company.

""I like the product, seems indispensable to many,"" Cramer said. ""But this is one that's just totally out of style, so if you want to stick with it, you need to get used to pain.""

Similarly to Atlassian, Cramer said he likes Zscaler as a company but believes the cybersecurity stock, which rose 61% in 2021, is tough to own at this current moment.

Chipmaker AMD rose 57% last year, and Cramer said he thinks the stock has become one that investors should own, not trade.

The German carmaker said its Vision EQXX prototype consumes less than 10 kilowatt hours of power per 100km due to sleeker design, greater efficiency and higher density batteries.

Most electric cars can travel just under 320kms before needing to recharge but Mercedes-Benz said its new design puts an end to ""range anxiety"". The fear of running out of power on the road is considered a key barrier to wider adoption of electric cars even though most journeys are relatively short.

Unveiling the prototype at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, Mercedes said its prototype ""demonstrates just how efficient, sustainable and luxurious electromobility can be"".

The design is expected to form the basis for cars going on sale in 2024 or 2025, although Markus Schafer, the chief technology officer, declined to specify when the 1,000 km-range battery would be ready for production.

""We will likely be the first to show a 1,000 km-range car in real life, with such a small battery,"" he said.

Mercedes needed to determine what range buyers expected and how much they are willing to pay before deciding when to start selling a car like the Vision EQXX, Mr Schafer added.

The prototype comes less than two months after Chinese carmaker GAC Group unveiled its Axion LX Plus SUV, which it claims will be able to travel 1007 kms (626 miles) on one charge.

In September, California EV start-up Lucid started producing its 500-plus-mile range Air.

Major carmakers have been overhauling their operations to produce electric vehicles in line with the shift away from fossil fuels, with several countries planning to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. The UK will ban such sales from 2030.

In July, Mercedes-Benz announced plans to invest more than US$47 billion (£34bn) by 2030 to take on Tesla and wind down spending on fossil fuel engine technology this decade.

The Vision EQXX also features an interior made using sustainable materials including mushrooms, bamboo, cactus and vegan silk.

""These show that it is still possible to achieve the utmost in automotive luxury without using animal products, whilst creating an inimitable feeling of premium comfort. This fascinating journey has halved the carbon footprint of the leather alone,"" Mercedes said.

The prototype comes as BMW appeared to have overtaken its arch rival in the global sales race for the first time since 2015.

Pieter Nota, BMW's sales chief, wrote on LinkedIn: ""Proudly claiming number one position in the global premium automotive segment for the BMW brand in 2021.""

The car marker will not report its annual sales figures until January 12, a spokeswoman said, but BMW delivered 1.7m vehicles for the first nine months of 2021, beating Mercedes-Benz by more than 112,000 vehicles.

BMW has been less affected by the global semiconductor shortage that has snarled production lines globally.","{'uri': 'newstalkzb.co.nz', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NewstalkZB'}","[{'uri': 'daily_telegraph_uk@newstalkzb.co.nz', 'name': 'Daily Telegraph Uk', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/gbcl5pjm/mercedes-vision-eqxx.jpg?mode=crop&width=635&height=395&rnd=132858637463700000,0.2,eng-7380045,False,0.5098039507865906,0.2,379039920,1

Wallbox introduces its second-generation Quasar bidirectional electric vehicle charger at CES this week. The Quasar 2 is designed specifically for the North American market and utilizes the CCS (Combined Charging System) standard.

Two years ago at CES 2019, Wallbox introduced its first version of the Quasar and we were there to report the news. That unit was only available in CHAdeMO and the plan was to launch it in Europe later that year and then offer it in the US shortly after. While it did become available in select European markets for the price of about $4,000, it was never offered in North America.

Now we know why. Wallbox decided to redesign the Quasar, increase the power delivery from 7.4 kW to 11.5 kW, and switch the connector from CHAdeMO, which is being phased out in North America and Europe, to the dominant standard in those markets, CCS.

The additional power delivery is significant, and not only for EVs that can accept 11.5 kW on level 2 charging but for all EVs. That's because the Quasar 2 is a DC charger, so it delivers power directly to the vehicle's battery. The power doesn't need to go through the vehicle's onboard charger, and thus, isn't limited to its maximum output.

Therefore, the Quasar 2 will deliver up to 11.5 kW to EVs like a BMW i3 or a Chevy Bolt that are normally limited to 7.7 kW while charging at home on level 2. The Quasar 2 connects to the myWallbox app through Wifi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, or 4G.

However, the feature that really makes the Quasar 2 interesting is its Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) bidirectional power capabilities. The Quasar 2 allows owners with compatible EVs to use their car as an emergency generator in instances of power outages. But we need to stress ""compatible EVs"". Just because an EV uses the CCS standard and can be charged with the Quasar 2, doesn't mean it is capable of bidirectional power delivery.

In fact, outside of the Lucid Air, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, and Kia EV6, we don't believe any EV available today is ready for CCS bidirectional power flow. The Ford F-150 Lightning will soon be able to, but there's also the question of whether or not these vehicles will communicate properly with the Quasar to perform the task. We're sure Wallbox has thought about these issues, but questions remain, nonetheless.

Blackout Mode will also require additional equipment, like an automatic transfer switch to isolate the house from the grid during power outages. That's necessary so the power the vehicle is supplying to the home doesn't back-feed the grid. If it did, it would pose a danger to utility workers that are working on the power lines to restore power.

""The average American experienced more than eight hours of power interruption in 2020,"" said Douglas Alfaro, General Manager of Wallbox North America. ""Whether it's caused by an earthquake, hurricane, wildfire or simply related to an overload on the power grid, a power outage can have a detrimental impact on homeowners that can last for hours or even days. With blackout mode, we are able to offer EV owners some relief by helping mitigate the impact of a major energy disruption in the home.""

With Blackout Mode, users will also be able to use their EV battery to store excess energy produced by their solar array or from the grid during off-peak hours when electricity is cheap and power their homes during peak hours when electricity is most expensive. This is exactly what many people do with Tesla Powerwalls and other stationary energy storage systems.

We asked Wallbox to give us a list of EVs available today that will work with Blackout Mode and the answer was vague: ""We are targeting broad compatibility with upcoming bidirectional capable vehicles"". Therefore, we really don't know how useful Quasar 2's V2H feature will be - initially, at least

We also don't have any pricing details. Considering the original Quasar cost $4,000 two years ago, we expect the 2nd generation to be at least the same price. That's really expensive for an 11.5 kW home charging station.

However, it's not unreasonable if you can use the Quasar 2 with your EV to perform V2H duties and power your home during a power outage. But you'll still need to purchase another piece of equipment to automatically disconnect your home from the grid first, and we don't have any information on how much that equipment will cost to purchase and install. Still, the system should cost much less than a Powerwall, or comparable home energy storage system.

We're hoping to get a hands-on demonstration as well as a loaner unit to review and Wallbox has promised to make that happen as soon as it's possible.

Let us know what you think about the Quasar 2 in the comment section below. Assuming you can get one and the necessary automatic transfer switch hardware installed for $5,000 to $6,000 total, would you be interested?

Ford's stock jumped more than 11% to its highest level since 2001 after the Detroit automaker said it will nearly double production capacity for its red-hot F-150 Lightning electric pickup to 150,000 vehicles. It said the model has already attracted nearly 200,000 reservations ahead of its arrival this spring at U.S. dealers.

GM rallied 7.3% a day ahead of its public debut of the Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup, which is slated to go on sale in early 2023. GM CEO Mary Barra is set to unveil the Silverado EV at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Tesla's announcement on Sunday that it delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter, crushing analysts' forecasts of 263,026, also heightened excitement about electric vehicles, one of the hottest investment themes on Wall Street. Tesla shares climbed more than 13% on Monday, but gave back 4.4% on Tuesday.

Ford has now gained nearly 17% over two days, a strong start to the year after surging 136% in 2021. GM has climbed 12% over two sessions, adding to its 41% gain last year.

Not all of Wall Street's EV makers got a lift on Tuesday. Rivian dipped 0.8%, leaving its gain since its initial public offering in November at 31%. Lucid Group lost 4%, while Nio dipped 5%.

The rally in GM shares came even after Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp released data showing it outsold GM in the United States in 2021, marking the first time the Detroit automaker has not led U.S. auto sales for a full year since 1931.

Ford CEO Jim Farley in early December told CNBC host Jim Cramer that Ford had to stop taking reservations for the Lightning.

TSLA investors have seen the stock rise more than 80% in the last six months. And if the first few days of 2022 are any indication, they'll see more gains ahead.

Tesla is one of the most popular stocks among traders and investors on the main online discussion forums. So let's list some of the top reasons why the electric vehicle (EV) stock has a great year ahead.

Tesla's market cap is over $1 trillion. The company is priced according to the technology it offers, not necessarily by the number of units it delivers.

It's currently among the top 10 most valuable companies in the world and trades at the highest price-to-earnings multiple: 360 times. That's five times more than runner-up Amazon (AMZN) - Get Amazon.com, Inc. Report.

But trends show that Tesla's output will start justifying its high valuation.

The company recently reported it delivered a record-breaking number of cars in the fourth quarter of 2021. Tesla delivered 308,600 vehicles. This represents year-over-year growth of 87%.

Analysts had expected fourth-quarter deliveries to be around 267,000.

As for full-year 2021, Tesla reported it delivered a total of 936,000 vehicles, versus an estimate of 897,000. For 2022, the company is expected to deliver 1.3 million vehicles. This should be no problem for Tesla, especially with its gigafactories in Texas and Germany coming online.

Mad Money's Jim Cramer recently threw in his two cents on Tesla's record-breaking delivery report. He pointed out that Tesla should be viewed as a great technology company above all else. Although many analysts consider its valuation expensive, Cramer thinks it will seem cheap in the near future:

""If you think about [Tesla's car delivery] rate, in 2025, this company is going to make 10 million cars. That's how you have to look at [Tesla's valuation].""

In a market driven by high-speculation assets such as cryptocurrencies, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), and other disruptive technology trends, investors often seem willing to overlook fundamentals and focus on far-out potential.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is one of the wealthiest people on Earth. And for better or for worse, his voice has been very influential on the markets.

His Bitcoin- and Dogecoin-related tweets have caused buying and selling frenzies. And Tesla is under the iconic CEO's influence, too.

However, putting aside Elon Musk's meme potential and tapping into his genius, the market is looking forward to Tesla's new products this year. Musk is expected to unveil new vehicle models such as a semi-truck, a ""supercar,"" and a cheap electric car in 2022. He should also deliver more information about the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck on the company's next earnings call.

Any positive announcements from Musk should lift his company's stock.

Currently, when it comes to electric vehicles produced worldwide, Tesla is the major player. The company has a market share of 15%, followed by Volkswagen and General Motors (GM) - Get General Motors Company Report.

In 2021, the size of the electric car industry was $287 billion. Third-party research firms expect this to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2028, at an impressive CAGR of 24%.

Tesla is the biggest player in this industry due to its cutting-edge technology and customer loyalty. That means it will naturally be a beneficiary of this industry's growth.

However, keep in mind that strong competition from other big EV players like Lucid (LCID) - Get Lucid Group, Inc. Report and Rivian (RIVN) - Get Rivian Automotive, Inc. Class A Report, as well as from traditional automakers like Ford (F) - Get Ford Motor Company Report, can pose a threat to Tesla's frenetic growth.","{'uri': 'thestreet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TheStreet'}","[{'uri': 'bernard_zambonin@thestreet.com', 'name': 'Bernard Zambonin', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/t_share/MTg1NzIxNDMzNjUxOTQ3MTM2/cali-naughton-atj2zooauym-unsplash.jpg,0.2549019607843137,eng-7377007,False,0.5607843399047852,0.2549019607843137,379039080,3

CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday broke down some of the best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 in 2021, offering his thoughts on how investors should approach them in the new year.

""Many of these Nasdaq winners have fallen out of favor and become incredibly dangerous, but the more tangible ones ... can work here,"" the ""Mad Money""' host said.

Lucid Group shares rose 280% in 2021, and Cramer said he knows many investors are justifiably looking for ""the next Tesla."" However, he cautioned that Lucid is still in the early stages of scaling up production.

""As much as I love the story, I hate the timing, especially with another lockup expiration ... coming later this month,"" he said. ""The last one crushed the stock.""

Cramer jumped to the fifth-best performer, Marvell Technology, because he discussed numbers 2-4 -- Moderna, Fortinet and Nvidia, respectively -- on Monday's episode of ""Mad Money"" as part of a segment on the top S&P 500 stocks.

For Marvell, Cramer noted he's long been a fan of the semiconductor company, which has undergone a reinvention under the leadership of President and CEO Matt Murphy. ""I think it can keep working in 2022 because this is a real company with real products and real profits. Notice, it was barely off today even as the rest of tech melted down,"" Cramer said.

Cramer said he believes investors should look to own Applied Materials, shares of which rose 82% in 2021, or one of its fellow semiconductor equipment makers such as KLA Corp. and ASML. KLA was the ninth-best performer in the Nasdaq 100, while ASML was No. 11.

Cramer cited the long-term demand trends, as semiconductors become integral to a growing number of products from cell phones to automobiles. ""Think of them as the limited arms dealers in the semiconductor cold war. I'd buy them on any dip, however shallow,"" he said.

Cramer said even though Datadog is considered a best-of-breed company in the world of cloud-based data analytics and monitoring, he believes investors are better suited in a different part of the stock market right now.

""This thing lost 8% of its value yesterday for no particular reason and then tumbled another 3.7% today. ... It's not the kind of stock you can afford to own when rates are on the rise,"" Cramer said.

Cramer said he believes Intuit -- which has TurboTax, QuickBooks and Credit Karma in its product suite -- has the best chance of any company on the list to repeat its ""terrific"" 2021 performance this year. Cramer touted Intuit's aggressive acquisition strategy in recent years and said it's become an indispensable company for small and medium-sized businesses. It rose nearly 70% in 2021.

Google-parent Alphabet saw its stock jump 65% last year. While some may say it's just catching up to its mega-cap tech peers, Cramer said the stock's story is more complicated than that. The company benefited from the rebound in advertising spending from industries such as travel, Cramer said, adding that investors are also expecting big things from the Google Cloud division.

Cramer said he's a fan of Atlassian, which makes tools for software developers, as a company.

""I like the product, seems indispensable to many,"" Cramer said. ""But this is one that's just totally out of style, so if you want to stick with it, you need to get used to pain.""

Similarly to Atlassian, Cramer said he likes Zscaler as a company but believes the cybersecurity stock, which rose 61% in 2021, is tough to own at this current moment.

Chipmaker AMD rose 57% last year, and Cramer said he thinks the stock has become one that investors should own, not trade.

""Quality means doing it right when no one is looking."" -- Henry Ford

In today's automotive marketplace of fast-moving electric vehicle start-ups and legacy OEMs trying to keep pace, speed to market seems to be the watchword. Customers are drawn to hip new technologies and gadgetry in the cockpit, and the exhilaration of mind-boggling acceleration and torque that electric vehicles can deliver. Meanwhile, though high quality and excellent reliability is expected by consumers, these criteria may be taking a back seat by manufacturers due to the ""need for speed.""

But as the electric vehicle market expands rapidly from the roughly 70 BEV and PHEVs available just in the US today to more than 165 by the end of 2025, quality and product reliability will unquestionably take a front seat as a key differentiator. And as consumers move beyond the initial thrill of owning their first EV, many will have little to no patience with software and hardware problems and demand much higher quality vehicles.

Multiple new EV-only automakers that have emerged in recent years, including Tesla, Rivian and Lucid, are creating a sense of urgency to launch new competitive EVs that just didn't exist within the legacy OEM marketplace. In the case of a company like Tesla, which had a reputation of speed first, its ""ship it fast and fix it later"" mentality has served them well and has propelled the Silicon Valley company (recently moving its headquarters to Austin, Texas) into the dominant EV maker worldwide.

Up to now, Tesla owners belong to what is called the innovators or tech enthusiasts of the classic product adoption curve, which is characterized by putting up with glitches and problems that are par for the course of being a trailblazer. The EV market is now entering the next phase of the adoption curve, however, characterized by early adopters or visionaries and this group will not have the same patience with buggy software or hardware failures.

Meanwhile, legacy automakers such as Volkswagen have recognized the need to move more quickly to better compete with OEMs like Tesla that are built from the ground up as tech-centric, hardware and software companies without the noose around their neck of a fleet of ICE vehicles that they need to continue producing. While he took much flak for it from many fronts, VW CEO Herbert Diess recently told his employees some hard truths (which incidentally almost cost him his job), including that they needed to have a greater sense of urgency and the company itself needed to move more quickly.

According to an article in Bloomberg, Diess apparently shared with employees in VW's Wolfsburg, Germany factory that ""Tesla is improving its build quality and will be able to build a vehicle from start to finish in 10 hours, triple the time it takes Volkswagen's main factory to spit out an electric car.""

Manufacturers are struggling with the very concept of building vehicles equipped to be digital services platforms. Smart device technologies are rooted in electronics and software technology where development cycles tick at a faster rate than the mechanically engineered car."" -- Bill Russo, CEO of Automobility Ltd

Of course, one of the key drivers and changes in building highly reliable products for electric vehicles is the fact that EVs simply need many fewer parts than gas-powered vehicles and increasingly those parts are built as electronic modules. But the other side of that coin is the reality that as EVs become more like hardware and software on wheels, they also typically use 3-to-1 more electronic components than ICE vehicles.

And, as I outlined in the previous article in this series, field failures are depending heavily on OTAs (over-the-air updates), but OTAs are limited in what they can do when the hardware fails. Swapping in and out hardware modules on paper is a brilliant idea, but much more complicated in practice. Case in point is that some OTAs have to cycle through several, if not all, modules to be successfully installed. But if there is a glitch somewhere in the chain, the update fails.

It may not always be clear whether the root cause is a hardware or software issue. A bad board, for example, due to a short or faulty component, is going to require a physical repair.

But as OTA updates become an ever increasingly important tool that can help keep EVs optimized and running, because many things can be the cause of an issue, they are not a silver bullet.

Along with the push for greater speed in getting electric vehicles to market more quickly, OEMs are laser-focused on reducing costs throughout the supply chain, powertrain components, and assembly process. And a current challenge with EVs is their higher cost compared to similar ICE vehicles, driven by the double whammy of lower production volume and the high cost of batteries.

""Chips are just one of a multitude of extraordinary disruptions the industry is facing -- including everything from resin and steel shortages to labor shortages. There's no room for error for automakers and suppliers right now."" -- Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at industry consultant AlixPartners.

In the current environment of supply chain challenges, shortages go beyond just microchips and include everything from seats to steel. ""Supply chain anxiety"" is driving OEMs to think very differently about who and how they work with suppliers.

In fact, the automotive supply chain is undergoing a massive disruption and being turned on its head as lower barriers of entry are opening the doors for many new players, both big and small. The Tier 1 automotive suppliers (e.g., Visteon, Valeo, Continental) no longer have a captive customer base of OEMs due to the historic complexity of building ICE vehicles; instead they are now going head-to-head with EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Service) companies (e.g., Flex, Foxconn, Pegatron) that traditionally built predominantly for consumer electronics, like cell phones, laptops, and smart home appliances.

Many of these new suppliers look nothing like Tier 1 companies and may be anything from a large multinational -- such as a Pegatron -- to a small ""mom and pop"" shop that may not have the same engineering resources but nevertheless can be a player in the EV space since they are often more nimble in getting a key prototype assembly to their customer. Speed is again the focus of the OEM while quality and reliability may be, for the time being, taking a back seat.

As a supplier to electronic assemblies, my industry that works largely behind the scenes is already seeing issues of scale-up that would have likely been caught through a more rigorous and experienced Tier 1. Frankly speaking, some of the new supply chain companies for EVs have little to no automotive experience and it is not uncommon to find some of the non-legacy start-ups with minimal experience themselves. After all, EVs are simply a computer on wheels, right? Terry Gou, the founder and former chairman of Foxconn, once said, ""If we can make iPhones, why can't we make EVs? It is an iPhone with four wheels.""

Having worked with Foxconn for more than 20 years, I don't doubt for a moment they will succeed, but that is beside the point. Quality and reliability are going to be, without question, real hot button issues for many OEMs as new EVs hit the road for the first time. An iPhone that stops working is an inconvenience. A critical EV module that fails, however, could be an accident or much worse.

I often say to my colleagues in electronics assembly, this is the most excited I have been for our industry since the entry of smartphones. Almost a week doesn't go by when you don't hear about yet another new OEM entrant in the EV space. But let's not kid ourselves. While some of these companies may in fact become the next Tesla, many of these automakers will not make it.

No one wants a great idea to fail, especially when issues like quality problems could have been avoided. At Indium Corporation, we bring decades of experience in automotive electronics materials and assembly and we have a significant role to play in not just providing reliable, scalable and proven products, but helping OEMs, Tier 1s, EMS, and the like make the best choices that lead to the lowest cost of ownership.","{'uri': 'emsnow.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'EMSNow'}","[{'uri': 'jennifer_read@emsnow.com', 'name': 'Jennifer Read', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.emsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Indium_Brian-OLeary.jpg,0.1215686274509804,,False,0,0.1215686274509804,379034040,1

Bhiri, deputy president of Ennahda -- viewed by President Kais Saied as an enemy -- was arrested by plainclothes officers on Friday and his whereabouts were initially unknown.

Ennahda had played a central role in Tunisian politics until a power grab by President Kais Saied last year. Tunisia was the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago, but civil society groups and Saied's opponents have expressed fear of a slide back to authoritarianism a decade after the revolution that toppled longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

""There were fears of acts of terrorism targeting the country's security and we had to act,"" Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine said late Monday of the arrest.

A member of a delegation that visited Bhiri in hospital said on Monday that he was refusing food or medication.

On Sunday activists and a former Ennahda legislator said Bhiri was in a critical condition and facing death.

But the source told AFP that Bhiri, 63, is ""not in critical condition for the time being.""

The source, asking not to be named, said that a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the United Nations rights commission visited Bhiri at hospital in the northern town of Bizerte on Sunday. He is ""lively and lucid,"" and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward.

Since Friday, however, Bhiri has ""refused to take any food or medication, prompting his transfer to hospital"" two days later, the source said.

Samir Dilou, a lawyer and ex-Ennahda MP, condemned Bhiri's arrest as ""political"" and an abuse of the justice system. He told a Tunis news conference that he is lodging a ""kidnapping"" charge against Saied and Interior Minister Charfeddine.

The interior minister said late Monday that evidence had been sent to the Justice Ministry regarding Bhiri's activities, but that the prosecution ""delayed"" action on the matter.

This, Charfeddine said, prompted him to ""quickly apply ... judicial control"" over Bhiri, in a context where he was suspected of ""falsifying"" identity papers, including for a Syrian woman.

The minister said he had ""personally verified"" that the detainee was being ""treated well.""

Bhiri's wife, Saida Akremi, also a lawyer, told reporters he had suffered ""a heart attack,"" and that she was being denied access to him because she refused to sign documents as demanded by security services.

Mondher Ounissi, a doctor and member of Ennahdha's executive bureau, said on Sunday that Bhiri suffers from several chronic illnesses, including diabetes and hypertension.

He has been ""deprived of his medication"" and ""his life is threatened,"" Ounissi said, adding that Bhiri usually takes 16 pills a day.

The Interior Ministry on Friday said that two individuals had been ordered under house arrest, without identifying them.

It said the move was a ""preventive measure dictated by the need to preserve national security.""

The anti-torture group INPT has identified the second person detained as Fathi Baldi, a former interior ministry official.

The president ""bears full responsibility for the life of Mr. Bhiri,"" the anti-Saied group ""Citizens against the coup"" said Sunday on Twitter.","{'uri': 'arabnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Arab News'}",[],https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/main-image/2022/01/04/2998556-1088617242.jpg,-0.2941176470588235,eng-7377822,False,0.8313725590705872,-0.2941176470588235,379033620,1

IPOs to watch in 2022 after an active 2021

Over the last year, the markets have contended with a global shipping crisis, the ongoing pandemic, and creeping inflation. Despite those risks, a huge number of companies made their public debuts in 2021.

We're talking Coinbase (COIN), Rent the Runway (RENT), Robinhood (HOOD), and, of course, electric vehicle makers Lucid (LCID) and Rivian (RVIN). Not every company that went public performed well, though. While some 399 initial public offerings raised $142.5 billion in 2021, the majority of IPOs ended the year below their initial returns.

And while the 2022 market will start off slow thanks to the continuing pandemic and chip shortage, plenty of big-name firms are primed to hit the public markets this year.

Think Reddit, Flipkart, and Mobileye to name a few. And it doesn't stop there. Yahoo Finance spoke with Avery Spear at Renaissance Capital, who gave us the lowdown on the hottest initial public offerings coming to the markets in 2022.

Vinfast

At the top of the 2022 IPO list is Vietnamese automaker Vinfast. A spinoff of Vingroup, a Vietnam-based conglomerate dealing in everything from real estate to health care, Vinfast is pivoting to electric vehicle manufacturing with its eyes on the U.S. and European markets.

""As you've seen with Rivian, [electric vehicles are] a very hot space right now,"" Renaissance's Spear told Yahoo Finance. ""They've already started taking preorders, which is kind of around where Rivian was when it was coming to the market.""

The company debuted two electric vehicles, the VF e35 and VF e36, at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November and plans to open a whopping 60 showrooms in the U.S. in 2022. The company plans to begin taking pre-orders for its vehicles in the first half of next year and have them on the road by the tail end of 2022.

With a projected $60 billion valuation, Vinfast will enter a U.S. market that's riding a wave of EV investments -- whether that's Tesla (TSLA), which saw its valuation skyrocket in 2021 to $1 trillion, or Rivian, which IPO'd in November, raising nearly $12 billion.

Sticking with the automotive industry, Intel (INTC) is planning to spin out its Mobileye business in 2022. Acquired by Intel in 2018 for $15 billion, Mobileye is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) with an eye toward developing the technology needed to power self-driving cars. The IPO could be valued at as much as $50 billion, and prove to be a boon for chip giant Intel.

In December, the company launched a robotaxi pilot program testing its autonomous capabilities on the streets of Paris. The move will allow employees of the Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann to request a ride to work via the robotaxis four days a week. A safety driver will be behind the wheel.

If you didn't know what Reddit was before 2021, the meme stock craze powered by the popular WallStreetBets subreddit changed that. The sprawling message board boasts more than 50 million daily active users, 100 thousand subreddits, and 50 billion monthly views. Yeah, it's kind of a big deal. It's no wonder the site is often referred to as the internet's front page.

Reddit has been around since 2005 offering users the chance to chat about everything from small town happenings to the best strategies to beating their favorite video games. But WallStreetBets brought even more attention to the service, and played a major roll in the retail investor boom.","{'uri': 'f319.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'f319.com'}",[],,0.02745098039215677,,False,0,0.02745098039215677,379032720,1

Ford's stock jumped more than 11% to its highest level since 2001 after the Detroit automaker said it will nearly double production capacity for its red-hot F-150 Lightning electric pickup to 150,000 vehicles. It said the model has already attracted nearly 200,000 reservations ahead of its arrival this spring at U.S. dealers.

GM rallied 7.3% a day ahead of its public debut of the Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup, which is slated to go on sale in early 2023. GM CEO Mary Barra is set to unveil the Silverado EV at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Tesla's announcement on Sunday that it delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter, crushing analysts' forecasts of 263,026, also heightened excitement about electric vehicles, one of the hottest investment themes on Wall Street. Tesla shares climbed more than 13% on Monday, but gave back 4.4% on Tuesday.

Ford has now gained nearly 17% over two days, a strong start to the year after surging 136% in 2021. GM has climbed 12% over two sessions, adding to its 41% gain last year.

Not all of Wall Street's EV makers got a lift on Tuesday. Rivian dipped 0.8%, leaving its gain since its initial public offering in November at 31%. Lucid Group lost 4%, while Nio dipped 5%.

The rally in GM shares came even after Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp released data showing it outsold GM in the United States in 2021, marking the first time the Detroit automaker has not led U.S. auto sales for a full year since 1931.

Mercedes-Benz says it has designed an electric car capable of travelling 1000 kilometres on a single charge, about three times the average range of most rechargeable vehicles.

The German carmaker said its Vision EQXX prototype consumes less than 10 kilowatt hours of power per 100km due to sleeker design, greater efficiency and higher density batteries.

Most electric cars can travel just under 320kms before needing to recharge but Mercedes-Benz said its new design puts an end to ""range anxiety"". The fear of running out of power on the road is considered a key barrier to wider adoption of electric cars even though most journeys are relatively short.

Unveiling the prototype at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, Mercedes said its prototype ""demonstrates just how efficient, sustainable and luxurious electromobility can be"".

The design is expected to form the basis for cars going on sale in 2024 or 2025, although Markus Schafer, the chief technology officer, declined to specify when the 1,000 km-range battery would be ready for production.

""We will likely be the first to show a 1,000 km-range car in real life, with such a small battery,"" he said.

Mercedes needed to determine what range buyers expected and how much they are willing to pay before deciding when to start selling a car like the Vision EQXX, Mr Schafer added.

The prototype comes less than two months after Chinese carmaker GAC Group unveiled its Axion LX Plus SUV, which it claims will be able to travel 1007 kms (626 miles) on one charge.

In September, California EV start-up Lucid started producing its 500-plus-mile range Air.

Major carmakers have been overhauling their operations to produce electric vehicles in line with the shift away from fossil fuels, with several countries planning to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. The UK will ban such sales from 2030.

In July, Mercedes-Benz announced plans to invest more than US$47 billion (£34bn) by 2030 to take on Tesla and wind down spending on fossil fuel engine technology this decade.

The Vision EQXX also features an interior made using sustainable materials including mushrooms, bamboo, cactus and vegan silk.

""These show that it is still possible to achieve the utmost in automotive luxury without using animal products, whilst creating an inimitable feeling of premium comfort. This fascinating journey has halved the carbon footprint of the leather alone,"" Mercedes said.

The prototype comes as BMW appeared to have overtaken its arch rival in the global sales race for the first time since 2015.

Pieter Nota, BMW's sales chief, wrote on LinkedIn: ""Proudly claiming number one position in the global premium automotive segment for the BMW brand in 2021.""

The car marker will not report its annual sales figures until January 12, a spokeswoman said, but BMW delivered 1.7m vehicles for the first nine months of 2021, beating Mercedes-Benz by more than 112,000 vehicles.

BMW has been less affected by the global semiconductor shortage that has snarled production lines globally.

Mercedes said on Monday that supply problems will continue to affect the industry during the first half of this year.","{'uri': 'nzherald.co.nz', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NZ Herald'}",[],https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/NdfFZyWBr3sFJ_uLJwF46ahleSw=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/UMUXJSTBBCAXULOLZKMG2R7QJQ.jpg,0.223529411764706,,True,0,0.223529411764706,379026900,1

It said the model has already attracted nearly 200,000 reservations ahead of its arrival this spring at U.S. dealers.

GM rallied 7.3% a day ahead of its public debut of the Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup, which is slated to go on sale in early 2023. GM CEO Mary Barra is set to unveil the Silverado EV at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Tesla's announcement on Sunday that it delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter, crushing analysts' forecasts of 263,026, also heightened excitement about electric vehicles, one of the hottest investment themes on Wall Street. Tesla shares climbed more than 13% on Monday, but gave back 4.4% on Tuesday.

Ford has now gained nearly 17% over two days, a strong start to the year after surging 136% in 2021. GM has climbed 12% over two sessions, adding to its 41% gain last year.

Not all of Wall Street's EV makers got a lift on Tuesday. Rivian dipped 0.8%, leaving its gain since its initial public offering in November at 31%. Lucid Group lost 4%, while Nio dipped 5%.

The rally in GM shares came even after Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp released data showing it outsold GM in the United States in 2021, marking the first time the Detroit automaker has not led U.S. auto sales for a full year since 1931.

Ford CEO Jim Farley in early December told CNBC host Jim Cramer that Ford had to stop taking reservations for the Lightning.

Mercedes unveils Vision EQXX concept, aiming to boost EV range, lower costs","Mercedes-Benz is firing a shot across the bow of Tesla and other EV rivals with the virtual unveiling of the Vision EQXX concept. It is a compact car that can, according to the company, travel more than 1,000 kilometres on a single charge.

Most electric vehicles typically have a driving range of 300-500 kilometres. While some are capable of 600 kilometres, no mass-market EV on the road today has broken the 1,000-kilometre barrier.

Mercedes, however, claims its compact four-seat EQXX concept car can go the distance. It could, in theory, take you from Toronto to New York City, or from Vancouver to Banff without needing to be recharged. Rather than simply fitting the EQXX with a huge, heavy, expensive battery, Mercedes focused on efficiency to increase range and reduce costs.

Crucially, this isn't just some pie-in-the-sky concept car. The key technologies developed for the EQXX that enable such extreme driving range - a new battery, electric motor and a slippery aerodynamic design - will find their way into roadgoing Mercedes EVs beginning in 2024, according to Markus Schäfer, chief technology officer at Daimler AG, who oversees the development process of new Mercedes-Benz vehicles.

""What you can expect is much more range for a more-or-less similar price level,"" Schäfer said, speaking about Mercedes' next-generation EVs, arriving in 2024 and 2025.

Battery-related issues - their high costs, limited driving range, and a lack of recharging infrastructure - are among the main reasons why people aren't choosing EVs, according to Canadian survey by KPMG published last year.

""Battery technology is really at the forefront of all this,"" said Peter Hatges, national sector leader for automotive at KPMG in Canada. ""Who does [EVs] better? Who's going to have the longest range? Who's going to have the faster charging?"" Offering cheaper, smaller, more efficient batteries is key.

Tesla was, until recently, the only brand offering true long-range EVs, but other companies are rapidly catching up. The Air sedan from upstart Lucid Motors is rated for 837 kilometres by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Mercedes' own EQS sedan recently covered 679 kilometres on a single charge in an independent test by Edmunds.

Market share among established automakers is going to shift as some companies offer superior products, Hatges added. So, car companies are racing to improve battery technology in order to grab a bigger slice of the market, or at least to avoid losing an existing slice.

Mercedes didn't reveal exactly what type of batteries it's using for the EQXX, but compared to the brand's flagship EQS electric sedan, the concept car's battery is half the size and 30-per-cent lighter with almost the same total capacity, roughly 100 kWh. Developed with Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains - which builds the hybrid motors for Mercedes' Formula 1 racecars - the EQXX's battery is key to its long-range ability. It uses improved chemistry which increases the energy density of each battery cell by 20 per cent, Schäfer said. The cells are then packaged together more efficiently into an air-cooled battery pack.

In fossil-fuel terms, the company claims the EQXX uses the equivalent of just one litre of gas per 100 kilometres, or less than 10 kWh of electricity per 100 kilometres. For reference, the highly-efficient Tesla Model 3 Long Range is rated at 16 kWh per 100 km in Europe.

Later this year, a prototype road-legal version of the EQXX will try to prove it can indeed cover more than 1,000 kilometres in real-world driving.

Other features from the concept will end up in future production cars as well. Roof-mounted solar panels that provide extra range, active aerodynamics parts to help cut through the air, and a 900-volt charging system that can add 300 kilometres of range in just 15 minutes could all be part of future production cars, Schäfer explained in an interview.

""All the elements that we see in this car will make it into series production,"" he said. But, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be able to buy a 1,000-kilometre compact four-seat electric sedan from Mercedes in the near future.

""Probably we don't need all this range in a compact car,"" Schäfer said. This latest battery and motor technology is a toolbox. ""The toolbox efficiently can deliver 1,000 kilometres in real range, but if we don't need it, we can scale it down, scale down the battery,"" he said. In theory, that could lower costs for consumers, and for Mercedes.

Hydrogen fuel cells are another promising technology for long-range vehicles. But, hydrogen fuelling stations are even fewer and farther apart than EV chargers.

Whether or not there is demand for ultra-long-range 1,000-kilometre EVs largely depends on charging infrastructure, Schäfer said. Driving range won't be such a major concern once fast-chargers are readily available across the country, but Canada is still a long way from that.","{'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}",[],https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/aQbaZG-U87FcesyDB1IUzT8JwPk=/560x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tgam/GZNB3DMCW5FXTESJIJSJ4E57KM.jpg,0.01960784313725483,eng-7380045,False,0.6078431606292725,0.01960784313725483,379024380,1

Mercedes-Benz wants vanquish EV range anxiety in style -- at least in theory.

On Monday, the luxury marque unveiled a new battery-powered concept, the Vision EQXX, as part of the lead up to this year's Consumer Electronics Show. And, if it ever hit the road, it could succeed in pushing aside any driver's worries about driving range. That's because the new compact sedan would travel 621 miles on a single charge under real-world driving conditions, according to the automaker.

To hear the brand tell it, the EQXX was born out of a desire to design the most efficient Mercedes of all time. And if the specs prove accurate, the marque may have done just that. If the EQXX were to go into production today, it would easily be the longest range EV on the market, besting the current title holder, the Lucid Air Dream Edition, by more than 100 miles. The car will also use just 10 kWh of energy per 62 miles, according to Mercedes. That's the bonkers equivalent of a gas-powered car that can get 235 miles to the gallon. While charging stations are only expected to become more common in the coming years, this is an EV you could confidently take on a road trip right now, even where superchargers are few and far between.

Of course, it should be noted that the EQXX's range hasn't been certified by the EPA or reached under Europe's more-forgiving WLTP test cycle. Instead, it is based on ""internal digital simulations in real-life traffic conditions,"" according to the brand.

The EQXX can achieve its range feat thanks to an all-new powertrain that can produce 201 hp. That may not sound like much -- especially with some EV hypercars delivering 1,000-plus hp -- but the electric drive unit was engineered with the goal of achieving more with less. The engine, which is based on the powertrain in the upcoming Mercedes-AMG One hypercar, was designed entirely in-house, with some help from the brand's successful Formula 1 and Formula E programs.

Technical details are relatively scarce, but at the heart of the single-motor setup is an ultra-dense nearly 100 kWh battery pack that is 50 percent smaller and 30 percent lighter than the pack that powers the brand's current flagship EV, the EQS (that EV's powertrain produces up to 516 horses and has a range of 340 miles). It's aided by an innovative thermal management system that only kicks in when needed. This ""cooling-on-demand"" approach significantly reduces cooling drag. The prototype is also equipped with a heat pump that sucks up heat waste from the drive unit and surrounding air and uses it to heat the interior cabin. Finally, there's 117 solar cells installed in its roof that can add more than 15 miles of range on a sunny day.

Almost as impressive as the EQXX's range is its sleek, minimalist exterior. The low-slung four-door is decidedly futuristic, with clean flowing lines from front to back. Somehow, though, it also recalls classic sports cars from the '60s and '70s. That's due, in part, to a sloping roofline that tapers directly into the rear, creating a back end that seems to marry a McLaren Speedtail with an old Ferrari.

That shape is no accident. An EV can use almost two-thirds of its battery capacity cutting through the air, so Mercedes has sought to make the EQXX as streamlined as possible. It has a drag coefficient of 0.17, making it 15 percent more efficient than the EQS (0.20), which is already the world's most aerodynamic production car. In fact, its drag coefficient is even lower than that of a football (0.18).

The EQXX features a state-of-the-art cabin style similar to that seen in the Vision EQS, the concept the EQS is based on. Its centerpiece is a seamless dashboard-spanning infotainment screen that measures a whopping 47.5 inches across and has an 8K (7680×660 pixels) resolution. The display is the home to a voice-activated ""star-avatar"" that Mercedes calls your ""non-judgmental road trip assistant."" The marque says the screen will aid in navigation and also manage information for both drivers and passengers. It's safe to assume it would also offer an array of entertainment options.

Beyond the tech, Mercedes appears to envision a future where car cabins are made without animal products. The EQXX's interior will be outfitted with a variety of sustainable materials. This includes two types of vegan leather, one derived from mushrooms and the other from cacti. It will also have 100 percent bamboo-fiber carpets and trim made from recycled plastics.

As exciting as the Vision EQXX may sound, it's unclear whether or not it will ever hit the road. While we're seeing more and more concepts make the leap to series production -- like the Vision EQS and the BMW Concept i4 -- Mercedes hasn't announced plans to do the same with its latest prototype. The lack of technical details doesn't make us hopeful. On the other hand, the automaker is calling the vehicle ""new technology blueprint for series production,"" so don't be surprised to see some of EQXX's features inside Mercedes EVs in the years to come.","{'uri': 'robbreport.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Robb Report'}","[{'uri': 'bryan_hood@robbreport.com', 'name': 'Bryan Hood', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://robbreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/eqxx01.jpg?w=1000,0.2784313725490195,eng-7380045,False,0.658823549747467,0.2784313725490195,379024320,1

While a 300-mile range is more than enough for most drivers, that number is expected to increase in the coming years. Mercedes-Benz gave a preview of the future with the debut of its latest concept, the Vision EQXX, which is a sleek electric sedan that can travel over 620 miles on a charge.

With that much range, the Vision EQXX even beats the Lucid Air's 520-mile range, which is currently one of the longest-range electric vehicles (EVs) available. According to Mercedes-Benz, with a range of over 620 miles, drivers would only need to recharge the Vision EQXX twice a month. Mercedes-Benz has not released any big details about the EQXX's battery other than stating it has less than 100 kilowatt-hours of charge storage. The battery pack is also 50% smaller and 30% lighter than the one in the new Mercedes-Benz EQS electric sedan.

The EQXX is powered by a single electric motor with 201 horsepower and Mercedes-Benz says the powertrain is so efficient that 95% of its energy is sent to the wheels. The powertrain also features 900-volt architecture. On top of the roof, there's a solar panel with 117 cells, which powers the EQXX's ancillary electric systems, like the infotainment system, climate control, and lights. The solar panels can add up to 15 miles of range on a nice sunny day. Solar panels have been used by other vehicles, like the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid and Toyota Prius, but Mercedes' latest system has a much bigger impact on the vehicle's range.

On the outside, the EQXX features compact dimensions with a length that is just a few inches shorter than the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. With only one electric motor, the EQXX is not positioned as a sporty electric car, like the Porsche Taycan or Tesla Model S, instead, it's primarily focused on efficiency. Its sleek, aerodynamic exterior helps it slip through the air with a low drag coefficient of 0.17, which contributes to that long driving range.

""One of the best ways to improve efficiency is to reduce losses,"" explains Eva Greiner, chief engineer of the electric drive system at Mercedes-Benz. ""We worked on every part of the system to reduce energy consumption and losses through system design, material selection, lubrication and heat management.""

Inside there's a massive 47.5-inch display that spans the entire width of the dashboard. It has an 8k resolution and its navigation system has 3D graphics. The navigation system, which was created with NAVIS Automotive Systems, can depict a city from a satellite view down to a height of 33 feet.

There are also sustainable materials inside that are made of plant-based organic materials or recycled plastics. This includes vegan leather made from mushrooms, leather made from pulverized cactus fibers, and carpet made from bamboo. Recycled PET bottles are used in the floor area and there is artificial suede made from 38% recycled PET.

""The Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX is how we imagine the future of electric cars. Just one-and-a-half years ago, we started this project leading to the most efficient Mercedes-Benz ever built. The Vision EQXX is an advanced car in so many dimensions - and it even looks stunning and futuristic. With that, it underlines where our entire company is headed: We will build the world's most desirable electric cars."" said Ola Källenius, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz AG.

Although the Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX is technically a concept car, many of the technologies showcased in the concept will eventually find their way into the brand's production vehicles.","{'uri': 'treehugger.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Treehugger'}",[],"https://www.treehugger.com/thmb/ruwzfRlCyawVPbraEYK4sS6T9oc=/2236x1200/filters:fill(auto,1)/Mercedes-BenzVisionEQXX-9feac6e0c02f41eba72b373b91352916.jpeg",0.2392156862745098,eng-7380045,False,0.729411780834198,0.2392156862745098,379022040,1

2021 was another banner year for stocks. Major indices like the S&P 500 (up 27.23% year-to-date) and Nasdaq Composite (up 22.45% year to date) delivered another year of above-average returns. But stock market profits in 2022 may not be as easy as buying the index. Instead, it may come down to knowing which stocks to buy.

Why? There's a lot on the table that could put pressure on stocks across the board. Inflationary pressures could weigh on earnings. The prospect of rising interest rates could further dampen interest in growth stocks. As for pandemic recovery plays? Omicron has already impacted their performance, and could continue to do so. With this, it seems very unlikely indices will deliver another year of 20%-plus returns.

So, if stock picking is the way to go this year, which areas should investors focus on? As value investing could make a comeback this year, such names are a solid place to look for opportunities. That's not to say value stocks should be written off completely, however. Several underappreciated electric vehicle (EV) plays could break out in 2022. So too could some growth names that experienced big declines during 2021.

As we ring in 2022, consider the following 10 names, a mix of growth and value plays, stocks to buy. Each one has high potential to deliver stunning returns:

Over the past year, up 100% year-to-date, sporting goods retailer Academy Sports and Outdoors may seem like a name set to deliver more muted returns in 2022. Yet while the sell-side community expects it to see its earnings decline in the next fiscal year (ending January 2023), that doesn't mean shares will necessarily see a decline as well.

First off, despite its strong performance, ASO stock is cheap. Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 6.73x. Yes, that's on par with its peers, like Hibbett (NASDAQ:HIBB), which trades for 6.81x earnings. Still, trading at such a low multiple of its earnings, the company's debt repayment and share repurchase plans (detailed by our Louis Navellier in November) will have a significant impact on increasing the underlying value of each share.

Second, the retailer's performance next year may not be as bad as once expected. The team at Bank of America recently raised their FY23 earnings forecast for Academy. The sell-side analysts also ""see potential for accelerated store growth.""

With this, the investment bank reiterated its ""buy"" rating. It also raised its price target to $68 per share (it's at around $43 per share today). At depressed prices, due to the expectation that earnings will drop following the pandemic recovery, ASO stock has big upside if this thesis is proven wrong.

A few weeks back, my InvestorPlace colleague Josh Enomoto recommended CVLT stock, a cybersecurity play, as one of the best small caps to buy for the coming year. Taking a look at the details, it's easy to see why.

Namely, because it's cheap. At least, relative to its potential to deliver steady growth in the coming years. Yes, shares got hammered back in October, due to an earnings miss and weak revenue guidance. But as a Seeking Alpha contributor argued just after it announced its bad results and outlook, these issues may be temporary, a product of the supply chain headwinds the software industry is experiencing now.

In 2022, growth could bounce back. In large part, due to the success of CommVault's Metallic SaaS platform, a product line that's seeing significant growth. This could help send the stock, at almost $70 per share today, back to its 52-week high ($84.22). After that, perhaps up to new multi-year highs.

Earnings growth, along with multiple expansion, could easily send it up to $100 per share. Still beaten down by its late October earnings miss, consider it one of the best stocks to buy for 2022.

After spiking following passage of Congress's infrastructure bill, EV charging play EVgo has given back these gains. At $10.10 per share, the former special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is now back down below its SPAC offering price.

Nevertheless, EVGO stock has high potential to break out in the coming year. How so? While overshadowed by better-known charging plays like ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT), the company has leading market share in a key segment of the charging space (DC fast charging sites). Put simply, this makes it a much more formidable contender in the charging wars than it seems at first glance.

Along with this, EVgo's partnerships with General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) could help drive growth in the years ahead. Fading enthusiasm for EV plays is keeping it down. Analyst coverage on it is mixed as well, although the average analyst price target for it comes in at nearly 90% above its current stock price.

Even as a recovery hinges on the market's bullishness for EV stocks coming back, keep EVGO stock on your radar. If there's renewed interest in charging names, there may be time to buy it before it takes off once again.

Like EVGO stock, admittedly GGPI stock is only going to soar in price if ""EV Mania"" experiences another wave in 2022. If you're unsure this will happen, you may want to skip out on it. Yet if you're bullish EV stocks will perform well next year, as the trend isn't going away?

At today's prices, the implied value of Polestar is reasonable compared to its peers. I wouldn't buy it with the expectation it makes the same sort of moves Lucid and Rivian made in 2021. But with high potential to see moderate acceleration, it's one of the best EV stocks to buy, if you're confident such plays will again become popular among investors.

With historically high rates of inflation, and the supply chain headwinds, investors have low expectations for department store stocks. That's why the market has priced them at what best could be described as bargain basement valuations.

Kohl's stock is a prime example of this, with its super low P/E ratio of 8.88x. Sure, like other low-priced stocks, Wall Street has given it this valuation. Primarily, on the expectation that earnings in the coming fiscal year will see a sharp drop. But if its latest quarterly earnings and guidance are any indication, this concern may be overblown.

Beating analyst earnings per share (EPS) consensus by a wide margin last quarter (actuals of $1.65, versus 70-cent estimates), the retailer could continue to surprise over the next few quarters. This may enable KSS stock, up around 21.85% over the last year to see another surge in price in 2022.

That's not all. With activist investors rattling its cage, Kohl's could make moves in the coming year to help unlock underlying value as well. Such moves include a sale of the company to a private equity buyer, a spinoff of its e-commerce unit, or monetization of its real estate assets. Trading just under $50 per share today, this is another stock that could perform well over the next year.

PINS stock struggled throughout 2021, as the pandemic recovery brought with it a slowdown in user growth for the social media platform. Other factors, like a rumored buyout of it by PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) that failed to pan out, weighed on it as well.

So, with investors who got in about a year ago well underwater, what makes Pinterest a buy for 2022? User growth still could re-accelerate, as the company carries on with its international expansion. Revenue growth will likely carry on as well, as it continues to ramp up monetization efforts, to increase average revenue per user (ARPU).

Granted, PINS stock may seem pricey at a forward P/E of 34.6x. But this valuation may be underpricing the stock, relative to growth projections. Despite its reputation as a busted growth story, analysts estimate the company will see 24.9% sales growth, and a similar level of earnings growth, during 2022.

Again, like with other growth plays discussed above, I'll concede that rising interest rates, and the multiple compression that could follow, is a concern. While ""cheap"" relative to other social media plays, it could get ""cheaper"" if there's a further exodus out of growth stocks. That said, if you are of the opinion that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes will not sink stocks? You may want to buy Pinterest stock.

Its glory days as a meme stock have long since passed. Yet cannabis play SNDL stock remains an interesting opportunity for two reasons. First, of course, is the U.S. legalization angle. Even as investors have been disappointed thus far, the political winds are still shifting in the direction of legalization.

With more Republican politicians now pushing for pot law reforms, legalization could still be just around the corner, no matter who controls the U.S. Congress after the midterm elections. News of progress with making marijuana fully legal in the U.S. could send shares in this Canada-based pot company ""to the moon"" once again.

However, that's not the only way SNDL stock could get to higher prices. Success with its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) strategy, or with the debt/equity investments it's making in other cannabis companies, there's something else in play that could send it from the 62 cents per share it trades for today, back to prices well over $1 per share.

Sundial isn't the only appealing pot play out there. Another beaten down name, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), also looks appealing, for similar reasons. Consider either of them stocks to buy, ahead of a possible comeback over the next year.

A few weeks back, I had a mixed take on AT&T stock. While in agreement with the bulls that there was big upside potential from its spinoff/turnaround plans, souring sentiment due to its planned dividend cuts signaled to me that further moves lower were ahead.

Yet as it appears investors have warmed up to it lately, I may have jumped to the wrong conclusion. The media and telecom giant's move back to near $25 per share, after slipping to the low of $20s per share, could mean that dividend investors teed off about the pending cut may have now finally left the scene.

In turn, investors long T stock today may be in it for the potential upside that may arise when its large-scale restructuring plan is complete. As you may know, the company plans to divest its WarnerMedia segment next year. The media segment will merge into Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), with the combined company becoming Warner Bros. Discovery.

AT&T will then distribute the majority stake it'll receive in the combined entity to its shareholders. After that, ""Ma Bell"" will become a telecom pure play once again, likely with a lower but still above-average dividend yield. The value of the stock broken up could be significantly higher than what it trades for today. You may want to grab it now, as it may now be more likely to zoom back to $30 per share, rather than retreat back to near $20 per share.

During the first half of 2021, confidence in its turnaround sent auto parts maker Tenneco to as much as $22.75 per share. But over the past six months, the global chip shortage has impacted its performance. At around $12.81 per share today, it's down around 35% in the past six months.

However, if you've been looking for a way to wager that this issue will resolve in the coming year? This may be one of the best vehicles to do so. If the crisis resolves, and auto production gets fully back to normal? The auto part maker has a strong chance of delivering earnings over the next four quarters in line with analyst expectations.

With analyst consensus calling for earnings of $4.65 per share, TEN stock is a steal at today's prices. Even as auto parts makers typically trade for low multiples, if the stock simply maintained its current multiple of 2.08x, a move to $25 per share may be possible.

Considering its highly leveraged balance sheet, and the cyclical nature of the auto parts business, be careful. A continuation of the chip shortage could send it even lower. Risk-hungry investors, though, may find it to be an worthwhile opportunity.

ViacomCBS is one of many ""old media"" stocks trading at deep value prices, due to concerns their respective streaming game plans will fail to make up for shrinking audiences for legacy properties. Among the pack, this one may not be the cheapest. For example, AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) trades for just 4.66x earnings. This media stocks trades at a higher, but still relatively low forward multiple (8x).

Yet given the success it's had so far with streaming, VIAC stock appears mispriced. With the company planning to report streaming as its own segment starting next quarter, investors will soon have a better idea how much new media makes up its top and bottom line.

If this accompanied with better-than-expected results, and an indication that streaming is more than making up for TV's secular decline? A move to a much higher valuation could happen over the next year.

At $33 per share today, shares traded for as much as $101.97 per share right up until the Archegos fund blowup -- caused its collapse in price. I would count on a full move back to $100. However, as even a partial recovery would mean big gains for those buying it today, consider it one of the best stocks to buy right now.

Electric vehicle company Tesla was the most searched for ticker on Benzinga Pro in 2021, which likely isn't a surprise to readers. The ticker was the most searched for in the second quarter and ranked second in the first quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter.

Apple ended the year with a market capitalization of $2.9 trillion, coming close to the $3 trillion mark. The world's most valuable publicly traded company was the second most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro in 2021. Apple was the most searched for ticker in the third and fourth quarters, and ranked fourth in the first quarter and third in the second quarter.

Movie theater chain AMC had one of the biggest stories of 2021 with the company became part of a David vs. Goliath story of retail investors versus hedge funds and short sellers. The stock rallied with the ""ape"" community pushing the way. AMC was the fourth most searched for ticker in the first quarter and the third most searched for ticker in the second quarter.

One of only two stocks in the top ten most searched for tickers that ended the year negative was Chinese electric vehicle company Nio. The electric vehicle company could be in for an eventful 2022 with increased competition and China cutting EV subsidies. Investors will be watching to see if expansion into European countries and a rumored U.S. launch could help boost the stock.

SPACs were a hot topic in 2021 and one of the hottest SPAC mergers of the year was one between Churchill Capital IV and Lucid Motors. Combining the tickers CCIV and LCID, Benzinga Pro users made the electric vehicle company the fifth most searched for ticker in 2021. The company was the fifth most searched ticker in the first quarter and the second half of 2021.

Another popular stock in 2021 was video game retailer GameStop, which like AMC was in the middle of the retail investor versus hedge funds and short sellers storyline. Shares of GME were up significantly in January and February. The ticker was the most searched for on Benzinga Pro in the first quarter and ranked seventh in the second quarter. The ticker dropped out of the top ten in the second half of the year.

Software and data company Palantir was the seventh most searched for ticker in 2021, its first full year as a public company after a September 2020 IPO at $10 a share. The company was one of the most talked about companies throughout the year and ranked as a top ten searched for ticker in the first and second quarters on Benzinga Pro. The stock was one of two of the top ten most searched tickers with a negative return in 2021.

With over $450 billion assets under management, SPY is the largest ETF globally. The ETF mirrors the S&P 500, which holds a basket of 500 of the largest companies in the U.S. One of the common indices used to determine market strength, the S&P 500 beat both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq in 2021, making it the top performing of the three widely used benchmarks. The S&P 500 also hit record highs on 70 occasions in 2021. The ticker was the fourth most searched name on Benzinga Pro in the second half of 2021.

Biotech company Ocugen may be the surprise of the top ten and also the smallest by market capitalization at $906 million. Thanks to a COVID-19 vaccine called COVAXIN, the stock was widely discussed on top stock forums in 2021.

The semiconductor company ranked in the top 25 for searches in the first and second quarter. AMD was the eighth most searched stock in the second half of 2021, which could set the company up nicely for a strong 2022.

Viktor Orbán is special - Coda Story,"Trump endorsed the Hungarian president. Orbán has more in common with the GOP than you might think

Hungarian autocrat Viktor Orbán was the first incumbent head of state to endorse Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Now Trump is returning the favor.

""Viktor Orbán of Hungary truly loves his Country and wants safety for his people,"" Trump wrote on January 3 in an endorsement of Orbán's bid to be reelected in Hungary's presidential race to take place in April or May of this year. ""He is a strong leader and respected by all.""

Early on in Trump's political career, his praise of an authoritarian leader would have raised eyebrows. His admiration of Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un at first vexed and infuriated Republicans. But after years of coming to the defense of despots around the world, Trump's embrace of authoritarians has become a defining characteristic of his foreign policy. From Jair Bolsonaro to Orbán, Trump emerged as the leader of a group of wily, ""soft"" authoritarians who de-legitimize elections, demonize the press and take a xenophobic approach to immigration.

I spoke to experts on authoritarianism to understand why Trump's endorsement of Orbán isn't just more flattery.

Trump is known for publicly praising authoritarians from Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to China's Xi Jinping. Is it saying the quiet part aloud -- authoritarians stick together?

It's no secret that Trump has a soft spot for authoritarians, and he has shown his support for autocrats facing reelection before. In 2020, Trump endorsed Polish President Andrzej Duda, who weaponized homophobia to fuel his campaign. He continued the practice even after he left office and endorsed Brazil's far-right president Jair Bolsonaro in October 2021. ""Brazil is lucky to have a man such as Jair Bolsonaro working for them,"" Trump wrote.

Trump has admitted that he sees himself in Orbán. According to David Cornstein, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to Hungary under the Trump administration, the former president compared Orbán to a twin brother when the two leaders met in 2019.

""Trump correctly believes that Orbán is fighting the same forces as Trump fought in America: democratic institutions, a free press, an independent judiciary, ethics rules, and opponents who still try to insist on democracy and rule of law. Birds of a feather flock together,"" said Brian Klaas, an associate professor of global politics at the University College London and author of ""How to Rig an Election.""

Have other former U.S. presidents endorsed foreign leaders?

Yes. Former President Obama endorsed Emmanuel Macron in 2017 during the French presidential election which pitted Macron against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. But it's not a common practice for a U.S. president to endorse a candidate in a foreign election once they've left office.

Are there elements of Hungary's style of authoritarianism reflected in Trump's way of governing?

""Authoritarians learn from one another,"" Klaas wrote in an email to me. ""Their playbooks draw on similar tactics: attack the press, demonize opponents, particularly if they're ethnic or religious minorities, engage in nepotism and cronyism, undermine rule of law, steal, blame your opponents for the things that you're guilty of, and attempt to subvert free and fair elections.""

All of this is characteristic of both Orbán and Trump.

What about the GOP more broadly?

The embrace of Hungarian-style authoritarianism isn't limited to Trump. It's a facet of the GOP, argues David Pepper, the former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party and author of Laboratories of Authoritarianism.

Hungary is a competitive authoritarian country where the facade of democracy hides an autocratic reality. Elections take place, but districts are heavily gerrymandered and mail-in voting rules favor Orbán's supporters. The government controls the national election agency and packs the courts with conservative allies.

Pepper sees similar patterns in the U.S. He points to Ohio, where Republicans in the state legislature pushed to change the election process for judges to require candidates' party ID on the ballot. Or Wisconsin and Georgia where the Republicans have fought to take control of the states' electoral commissions.

Orbán's brand of competitive authoritarianism is ""a system where they cling to keeping an appearance of legitimacy while predetermining all the outcomes,"" said Pepper. ""And that's, I think, the closest parallel to what we see in so many states, and if those states and people like Trump have their way, what we would see nationally.""

It's not a coincidence that Hungary shares anti-democratic strategies like gerrymandering with the U.S. In fact, Hungarian autocrats have learned from the GOP, argues Szabolcs Panyi, a Hungarian investigative journalist with the independent newsroom Direct36.

""I think Orbán learned a lot from Republican policies and also mostly from Republican spin doctors. So it's Orbán who has been importing and implementing Republican tactics into Hungarian politics, not the other way around,"" said Panyi.

Other people in Trump's inner circle have been friendly towards Orbán recently. Tucker Carlson took a trip last summer to Hungary where his interview with Orbán made headlines. What does this say about the GOP and Trumpism right now?

Trump's support of Orbán ahead of Hungarian elections goes beyond his praise of Bolsonaro or Putin, argues Klaas. ""The authoritarian Republican base has made Orbán into a sort of folk hero,"" he said. ""They have created a false caricature of Orbán as some sort of conservative who defends Western values, rather than as a racist, anti-Semitic authoritarian who is using state power to destroy dissent while steadily enriching himself.""

In August 2021, Tucker Carlson took his viewers to Hungary to show off what he claimed was an exemplar of conserviatve nationalism. In a full week of coverage and one-on-one interviews with Orbán himself, Carlson praised the crackdowns on immigration and the pro-family stance that has fostered blanently homophobic policies.

On a visit to the Hungarian capital in September 2021, Former Vice President Mike Pence praised Orbán's restrictive abortion policies.

""Hungary has become the GOP's new model in terms of racist demographic politics and electoral autocracy,"" said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University and author of Lucid, a newsletter on threats to democracy.

It isn't a coincidence, Ben-Ghiat argues, that the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the annual gathering of American conservatives, will be held in Budapest later this year.

What's the message Trump and his inner circle are sending?

In a way, Trump is endorsing his own brand of authoritarianism too, argues Pepper, the former former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party.

""I think it says that they're all in on this form of governing,"" he said. It legitimizes Orbán, but ""it also legitimizes that brand of politics.""

Pepper is worried conservatives in the U.S. are taking notes on Orbán's authoritarian strategy. Tucker Carlson's visit to Hungary, CPAC's upcoming conference in Budapest and Trump's endorsement are all signs that conservatives are ""studying how they can build something here where they have a minority party and view of the world locked into power through an Orbán-style competitive autocracy.""

Hungarians aren't going to be swayed to vote for Orbán because of Trump's endorsement. So what does this mean for Hungary?

The Hungarian presidential election between Orbán and the opposition is tight, but it's hard to imagine that someone on the fence is going to be convinced by Trump's endorsement. But that doesn't mean the endorsement is unimportant.

Orbán has few allies in the European Union, and prior to Trump's administration, the Hungarian government was on the outs with the U.S. too. But because of Trump's public support, Orbán can claim he has allies who share his autocratic worldview, according to Panyi, the Hungarian journalist.

""This is material that Orbán and his people can use to fuel their propaganda, saying that 'Oh, even Trump supports us,'"" said Panyi. ""He can still portray himself as having some kind of backing from influential people. But in reality, Trump's out of power,"" he added.

Hungary is a small country with the population the size of Michigan. But a former U.S. president's support allows Orbán to claim legitimacy and relevance on the international stage. ""Think about it this way: do you think Trump knows the name of the president of Estonia? Absolutely not. The fact that Trump knows Orbán shows that Hungary is punching above its geopolitical weight, and Orbán and his followers will try to exploit that for their political gain,"" said Klaas, the political scientist at University College London.

So will Trump's endorsement add extra votes for Orbán? Probably not. But let's say the election doesn't go the way Orbán wants. By refusing to accept the results of the U.S. 2020 election, Trump created a roadmap for authoritarians to claim unfavorable elections were rigged. This cozy relationship between Orbán and Trump might set the stage for the Hungarian autocrat to make the same argument, said Orsyi Lehotai, a doctoral student in the Politics Department at The New School for Social Research. ""It basically endorses aspects of what happens when a political leader accuses its opponents of cheating with elections,"" said Lehotai.","{'uri': 'codastory.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Coda Story'}","[{'uri': 'caitlin_thompson@codastory.com', 'name': 'Caitlin Thompson', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Orban-Trump-endorsement.jpeg,0.3647058823529412,eng-7380575,False,0.7490196228027344,0.3647058823529412,379019340,1

Indigo's ground-breaking robotic wheels enable new sorts of electric vehicles that are substantially smoother, more spacious, and cost less to operate than any other vehicle in their class. When compared to the Toyota Rav4 and Ford Transit Connect, the FLOW and FLOW PLUS will be significantly better in all of these areas. With only a 40kWh battery, both FLOW and FLOW PLUS will give more than 250 miles of range.

With the rapid expansion of on-demand deliveries and ridesharing, as well as firms like Uber and Amazon joining the Climate Pledge, making efficient and capable EVs that drivers can afford is critical. Gig drivers can't afford today's heavy EVs because they're inefficient and expensive, but reducing mass to save money has meant compromising spaciousness and comfort due to traditional propulsion and suspension systems.

""Indigo invented robotic wheels that uniquely enable more space and comfort for small urban EVs,"" says Will Graylin, CEO of Indigo. ""Without the transmission and motor between the wheels, Indigo FLOW has a low, flat floor that provides more cargo space than any vehicle of its size. And the active suspension in each wheel makes for an amazing ride comfort at an affordable price that people will love.""

Automotive Innovators Join Indigo's Team

Indigo has made an announcement. Indigo has hired Volker Kaese, the former Audi Head of Innovation Product Management, as Chief Technology Officer. Kaese brings over 20 years of vehicle innovation to Indigo's automotive initiatives, having directed the development of the Volkswagen XL1 (310 MPG) and Audi e-Tron show cars.

""I am excited to deliver the highest impact on both driver experience and the environment,"" said Kaese. ""From the voluminous interior to the sliding doors Indigo FLOW will allow drivers to be more efficient at their jobs. Ultimately they will be able to earn more while also doing good for our planet.""

Eric Obers, formerly of Porsche and Lucid, and Hugh Robinson, formerly of Porsche and General Motors, will both join Indigo to lead design for the FLOW product range.

Furthermore, rising crude oil prices and initiatives to reduce carbon emissions should propel the industry's growth. Driven in part by these tailwinds, Tesla (TSLA), Lucid (LCID), XPeng (XPEV), Li Auto (LI), and Fisker (FSR) were the best performing pure-play electric vehicle stocks of 2021. So, let's take a closer look at these names. Read on.

Government initiatives to stimulate the transition to a zero-emissions future, such as providing tax incentives to electric vehicle (EV) purchasers, should drive the EV market's growth over the next couple of decades. The market share for the global electric car market surged to a new monthly record of 11.5% last November

Although 2021 was favorable for EVs, 2022 is expected to be even better as EV makers expand from midsize vehicles to minivans, SUVs, and even trucks. Furthermore, more than 50 new electric cars, trucks, vans, and SUVs have already been announced for arrival by 2024 and beyond. Investors' optimism about EV stocks is evidenced by the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF's (DRIV) 13.8% gains, versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF's (SPY) 9.4% returns over the past three months.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Lucid Group, Inc. (LCID), XPeng Inc. (XPEV), Li Auto Inc. (LI), and Fisker Inc. (FSR) were among the best performing pure-play electric vehicle stocks of 2021. So, we think one could consider adding them to one's watchlist.

Investors broadly agree on the thought that electric vehicles (EVs) are the future of transport. What they are divided on, however, is whether EV stocks make a good buy right now considering their high valuations.

As an example, consider Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID). The EV start-up started deliveries of its first cars in October 2021. For 2022, the company expects to produce 20,000 vehicles. Yet, Lucid stock is currently trading at a market capitalization of more than $60 billion. Notably, that's down significantly from a valuation of more than $90 billion that the stock was sporting in November. Lucid stock rose 280% in 2021. Let's discuss the key factors that may drive the stock in 2022.

The first big factor that's going to drive Lucid stock in the new year is the company's ability to deliver in line with its targets. Lucid aims to deliver 20,000 cars in 2022. After delivering an impressive car with a top range, performance, and design, Lucid's next task is to deliver vehicles at scale. If the company progresses well with its delivery plans, the stock could see continued momentum in 2022.

At the time of Lucid's third-quarter results, the company showed confidence in its ability to deliver cars as per its plans. The company's factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, has a production capacity of 34,000 vehicles per year.

Furthermore, Lucid plans to launch the Grand Touring, Touring, and Pure versions of the Lucid Air in 2022. In 2023, Lucid plans to start production of its SUV called Gravity.

Lucid has delivered an electric car with a longer range than that available in the market. Notably, that wasn't only due to a larger battery pack. The efficiency -- the distance a vehicle can travel using a specific amount of electricity -- of Lucid's batteries is also higher. The Lucid Air enjoys a battery efficiency of more than 4.5 miles per kilowatt-hour, higher than Tesla's Model S's efficiency of 4 miles/kWh.

Lucid has been working on its battery technology for more than 10 years. Its batteries are used by teams in Formula E, the world's premier EV racing series. Cutting-edge EV technology is a clear plus for Lucid.

Beyond technology, Lucid has solid growth plans. It plans to increase its vehicle deliveries to 50,000 in 2023. Over time, the company aims for 500,000 annual vehicle deliveries. To achieve that, Lucid plans to expand its target market. First, the company plans to enter the Middle East and China markets. Second, it plans to target the mass markets by introducing lower-priced vehicles.

The Lucid Air's Dream Edition starts at $169,000. By comparison, pricing of the Air Pure, which the company plans to launch in 2022, will start at $77,400. Lucid believes that as its batteries are more efficient, it can achieve the same range as other available electric cars in the market at a lower cost. This will not only help it in offering attractively priced vehicles for the mass market, but also generate a higher margin than its competitors.

With very few deliveries so far, Lucid stock's market capitalization of more than $60 billion looks gigantic. However, if we consider the company's plan of generating nearly $23 billion in sales in 2026, the valuation doesn't look too unattractive. Many electric vehicle stocks are lately trading at such high valuations.

A widely held belief is that EV companies can generate recurring revenue through software and subscription services, which differentiates them from legacy auto companies. Whether this turns out to be true or not remains to be seen. In addition to the high valuation, another risk that Lucid faces relates to execution. If the company's costs exceed its expectations, its margins might potentially get hurt.

In short, Lucid stock faces risks, but that is true for nearly every EV stock out there. So, if you have a high tolerance for risk, Lucid stock could be a great addition to your EV portfolio in 2022.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'rekha_khandelwal@fool.com', 'name': 'Rekha Khandelwal', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659633/lucid-air-exterior-02.jpg,0.1529411764705881,eng-7381244,False,0.8470588326454163,0.1529411764705881,379010940,38

Bhiri, deputy president of Ennahdha -- viewed by President Kais Saied as an enemy -- was arrested by plainclothes officers Friday and his whereabouts were initially unknown.

Ennahdha had played a central role in Tunisian politics until a power grab by President Kais Saied last year.

Tunisia was the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago, but civil society groups and Saied's opponents have expressed fear of a slide back to authoritarianism a decade after the revolution that toppled longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

""There were fears of acts of terrorism targeting the country's security and we had to act,"" Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine said late Monday of the arrest.

A member of a delegation that visited Bhiri in hospital told AFP on Monday that he was refusing food or medication.

On Sunday activists and a former Ennahdha legislator said Bhiri was in a critical condition and facing death.

But the source told AFP that Bhiri, 63, is ""not in critical condition for the time being"".

The source, asking not to be named, said that a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the United Nations rights commission visited Bhiri at the hospital in the northern town of Bizerte on Sunday.

He is ""lively and lucid"", and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward.

It was a phoenix moment for Nio (NYSE:NIO) when it emerged from penny stock status in 2020 to highs of $67 in early 2021. However, the last few quarters have been disappointing from a stock performance perspective. Over the 12-month period, NIO stock has declined by roughly 34%.

I believe that this dip provides a golden opportunity for accumulation, however. On the correction, there are two important points to note.

First and foremost, a multi-fold rally has been followed by a 35% correction. Over a 24-month period, NIO stock is still among the best performers. Furthermore, Nio has used its stock upside to create a strong cash buffer. Recently, the company raised $2 billion from an at-the-market offering.

Really, the weakness in NIO does not represent any big business headwind. In fact, deliveries have been robust. And more importantly, there seems to be some big catalysts lined up for 2022 and 2023, making this name an attractive bet.

One reason to like Nio is its pipeline of new launches for 2022. Specifically, the company's ET5 is set for launch in September 2022. That model will likely be a significant rival to Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 in China.

The initial bookings seem to be encouraging as well; the ET5 is the most pre-ordered model of Nio vehicles. As its commercial launch nears, the order book should swell.

Pricing is one major reason why. Before government subsidies, the ET5 will likely be priced at $51,450. With Nio's battery-as-a-service (BaaS) plan, the price will also likely come down to $40,470.

Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu believes that the ET5 can outsell the ET7 by 2023. This puts the potential growth in deliveries into perspective.

It's also worth noting that Nio has a total of three models for launch in 2022. This includes the ET5 and an SUV. The new models will be on the Nio Technology Platform 2.0.

Clearly, the current year should be bright for this company. I would not be surprised if growth accelerates meaningfully from 2023 to 2025.

Back in September 2021, Nio forayed into the international markets with the ES8 SUV. But the company's launch in Norway is just the beginning of its ambitious expansion plans into markets around the world.

In 2022, the company has plans to enter Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, for instance. Further, Nio is likely to expand to 25 countries by 2025. Including the at-the-market offering, Nio already has a cash buffer that's in excess of $9 billion. This will help in accelerating its global presence.

It's also worth mentioning here that Nio is focused on technology and innovation to drive growth. Recently, Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) announced that its first car, the Lucid Air, has been rated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a range of 520-miles.

According to Nio, the ET5 has a range of 1,000 kilometers (or 621-plus miles) with its 150-kilowatt hour Ultralong Range Battery. Going into the international markets, the company is equipped with the latest in terms of technology. This includes range, autonomous driving (AD) and augmented reality (AR) technologies.

Overall, Nio appears to be well-positioned to cater to the needs of a bigger addressable market. This will ensure sustained growth in vehicle deliveries and the top line. Sure, with international expansion, margins will likely be impacted due to higher sales and marketing. But the markets will focus instead on the company's broadening audience. Things seem optimistic on that front for NIO stock, considering the technology perspective.

NIO stock looks attractive after a meaningful correction. In the next 12 months, the company has three new model launches planned. At the same time, manufacturing capacity expansion will support its international growth plans.

Nio will also continue to benefit long-term from positive industry tailwinds. The company has boosted its balance sheet cash and seems well-positioned to capitalize on the growth momentum in electric vehicles (EVs) globally.

The best time to buy a quality stock is when sentiments are down. NIO stock looks to be positioned for a strong reversal in trend.

On one hand, 2021 was the year of LCID stock, with shares returning just a hair under 279%.

But on the other end of the scale, the equity unit's performance over the trailing month - down nearly 26% - left prospective buyers scratching their heads.

If you fall into the latter camp, I think it's a reasonable sentiment. It's not just that EVs still represent a rather nascent industry with plenty of risk factors affecting it. Rather, it's also because if LCID stock lost this much, it raises the prospect that a greater discount is in store.

While I'm not going to give price targets, it's possible that if LCID stock can't get above its 50-day moving average - a common gauge of nearer-term market strength - then weak-handed stakeholders could reduce their exposure. With the Federal Reserve signaling rate hikes in 2022 to address soaring consumer prices, it's not out of the question for investors to rotate into safer, more reliable investments.

Such a circumstance could see LCID stock dip to its 200-day moving average, a common longer-term market health gauge. But if that were to pan out, I'd really be tempted to take a nibble. Unlike so many other EV-related competitors to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Lucid started its operations with a viable strategy.

I'd argue - given where EV technology is now - it was the only strategy to go up against a giant like Tesla.

With many other Tesla rivals - including the upstarts and the traditional automotive manufacturers - you get the impression that they're reacting to the burgeoning EV sector rather than considering adding something distinct to its development.

That's no knock against these competitors. If anything, Tesla should be praised for lighting a fire under the feet of the entire auto industry. Sometimes the best change happens under pressure.

However, what stands out for those willing to take a stab at LCID stock is the underlying ethos. According to a May 2017 article by TechCrunch, Lucid's vice president of design Derek Jenkins envisioned how its EVs would integrate with another burgeoning sector, the sharing economy. Per the report:

That guided the design of the car from the very start, with Lucid aiming to create the first luxury car that was actually made from the ground-up with car-sharing in mind. It's why when you sit in the backseat (the top trim back seat, at least), you feel like a first class passenger. But since it's a car designed to span both the age of the driver and the age of driverless vehicles, with eventual plans to upgrade its software to offer full autonomy, the cockpit also feels comparable to luxury driver-focused vehicles.

But the harsh reality is that until it scales up significantly, the sharing economy largely benefits the well-to-do folks. I mean, people nowadays dial up ride-sharing services, I get that. However, those who take advantage of such rides frequently - along with other services like food deliveries - have the money to do so.

That's why I can't help but like LCID stock despite its challenges. The underlying company had the right idea from the get-go.

That's not to say that Lucid won't eventually compete for more budget-minded consumers. As well, I don't want to outright impugn the viability of EV manufacturers vying for average-income households. However, the current cost and scale of EVs and battery technology has meant that the latter category faces tough challenges.

Arguably, the least of those challenges is competition. After all, if average-income consumers can't afford EVs, it really wouldn't matter how many similar-priced options are available.

But LCID stock also gains fortuitously from the coronavirus pandemic. As consumers panicked and basically bid up used car prices due to the global supply chain crunch, it's possible that EV integration may have been delayed several years as a result.

After paying such outrageous prices, I doubt that most Americans will then transition to EVs. First, they'll run their combustion vehicles they acquired at a premium to the ground (where it would then make sense to pay such a premium in the first place), then they'll consider going electric.

But you know who doesn't care about such problems? Rich people. And they're exactly the category Lucid is targeting, which bodes well for LCID stock.

You couldn't script a more shock and awe way to start 2022 than the fifth-largest U.S. company by market cap, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), surging 14% on Monday thanks to record-high Q4 and full-year 2021 production numbers.

Let's compare how Tesla's production numbers stack up to legacy automakers like Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) and determine if Tesla is a good stock to buy now.

The data isn't out yet for every automaker, but we do know that Ford delivered 1.73 million vehicles from January to November 2021, GM delivered 1.78 million vehicles in the U.S. alone in the first nine months of 2021, and Toyota delivered a staggering 7.99 million vehicles from January to October 2021. It's worth noting that Toyota, which has done a better job navigating the global chip shortage than GM, delivered 1.86 million vehicles in the U.S. in the first nine months of 2021 and is on track to dethrone GM as the largest automaker by sales in the U.S. for full-year 2021.

Tesla's record delivery numbers are incredible considering they represent an 87% increase from 2020. Tesla has yet to disclose its delivery numbers by region, but investors will be able to glean more information on Tesla's 2021 performance and deliveries during its next earnings call. Until then, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that Tesla could become the best-selling automaker in the U.S. within the next five years or so.

This optimistic attitude toward the future of Tesla is one of the main reasons why the electric car stock is worth nearly three times more than Ford, GM, and Toyota combined. Yet there's a good argument why buying a basket of stocks consisting of equal parts Ford, GM, and Toyota is a better strategy for investors than going all-in on Tesla.

Ford and GM are investing heavily in EVs. Recognizing the challenging battle they've been waging with European and Asian automakers, both companies see EVs as a way to generate growth from a less competitive playing field. A headstart combined with desired products could give both companies what they need to become relevant players in the EV market.

Ford plans to generate 40% of its 2030 revenue from EVs by building massive EV production facilities as well as its batteries in-house. On Tuesday, Ford announced it was doubling its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck production to 150,000 vehicles per year in response to a reservation count that is quickly approaching 200,000. Ford had to stop taking reservations for the Lightning in December due to better-than-expected demand.

GM has announced it will launch 30 new EV models globally by 2025, generate $90 billion in annual EV revenue by 2030 and roughly $280 million in total revenue, and have an operating margin of 12% to 14% by 2030. GM recently began deliveries of its Hummer EV pickup truck and BrightDrop EV600 commercial vehicle and has plenty of highly anticipated announcements coming up in the months ahead.

Although Toyota announced a $13.6 billion plan to develop its own battery supply chain and produce EVs, it remains a truly entrenched yet dominant internal combustion engine-focused (ICE-focused) legacy automaker that is in a different category than Ford or GM. However, what Toyota does provide in a basket of EV stocks is a solid bet that the industry-leading ICE automaker will play a role in the transition toward EVs. Toyota is arguably the most efficient and diversified legacy automaker in the business and is a good value with a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 20.

The EV industry seems like it's moving fast. But EVs only make up 3% of new car sales in the first half of 2021 in the U.S. and 13% in both Europe and China between January and October 2021. Battery electric and plug-in hybrids made up 7.2% of new car sales globally in the first half of 2021.

Investment by legacy automakers is just one of the many ways that show that Tesla and other pure-play EV companies like Lucid Group and Rivian Automotive are just the tip of the EV stock iceberg.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'daniel_foelber@fool.com', 'name': 'Daniel Foelber', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659814/1-ev-concept.jpeg,0.2627450980392156,eng-7378627,False,0.5058823823928833,0.2627450980392156,379006080,1

Reza Alizadeh is the translator of the book, which was originally published in 2005.

Augustine's ""Confessions"", written at the close of the fourth century CE, is a highly significant text in the history of European culture.

Augustine explains just how and why he came to abandon a successful career and the personal enjoyments of a largely secular existence to follow a life of prayer and study, leading to a true comprehension of God and the Bible.

The avowed approach of this introductory book is to ""historicise"" - to set Augustine's own experiences of religion, philosophy and Christian faith against the long-standing political, cultural and religious traditions of the classical world.

Late antiquity saw the transformation of the classical heritage and its transmission by Christian authors.

Augustine's ideas about how texts may be presented and read, as well as how people respond to written and spoken language, find resonance in recent critical theory.

The world in which Augustine lived, the structure, style and purpose of the Confessions, and the problems of rhetoric and truth posed by its author's personal search for himself are all scrutinized in this lucid introductory account.

Clark is an Emeritus Professor of classics and ancient history at the University of Bristol. She retired from the University of Bristol in 2010. Clark has made a significant contribution to the history, literature, and religion of late antiquity.

Clark studied Greek and Latin language and literature, ancient history, and philosophy at Somerville College, Oxford. She received her Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the University of Oxford. She has taught at the universities of Glasgow, St Andrews, Manchester, Liverpool and Bristol.

D Sajith Babu, an IAS 2012 batch official currently serving as civil supplies commissioner, has come out with an e-book, 'A prelude to Kerala Land Revenue Manual'. Written in a lucid style, the manual has explanations for 500 official terms while avoiding technical jargon.

The previous three books on land reforms were William Logan's 'Malabar Manual' in 1887, former Divan V Nagam Aiya's 'Travancore State Manual' in 1911 and C Achuthamenon's 'Kochi State Manual' for particular regions. But, the book

by Sajith Babu is the first of its kind on land reforms since the state's formation in 1956. Babu, 50, had been a deputy collector for 12 years in the revenue department and it was the wealth of experience he garnered from his time there that prompted him to come out with a manual on land revenue. He is credited with implementing the e-District project in the revenue department.

""For an administrator, knowledge of land revenue matters is crucial. I have realised that people, especially entrepreneurs, get totally confused about the precautions to be taken while purchasing land in the state and how to go about the task. The 923-page comprehensive e-book will be a boon for everyone, including revenue and local bodies, and will also act as a reference book for students of history, agricultural science, public administration and journalism,"" Sajith Babu told TNIE.

He is also presently serving as the State Mission Director of National Ayush Mission. He has been associated with many IT-based governance initiatives.

The e-book will be released by Revenue Minister K Rajan in the presence of Food and Civil Supplies Minister G R Anil at Hotel Mascot here on Tuesday.

Mercedes-Benz says it has designed an electric car capable of travelling more than 600 miles on a single charge, about three times the average range of most rechargeable vehicles.

The German carmaker said its Vision EQXX prototype consumes less than 10 kilowatt hours of power per 100km due to sleeker design, greater efficiency and higher density batteries.

Most electric cars can travel just under 200 miles before needing to recharge but Mercedes-Benz said its new design puts an end to ""range anxiety"". The fear of running out of power on the road is considered a key barrier to wider adoption of electric cars even though most journeys are relatively short.

Unveiling the prototype at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, Mercedes said its prototype ""demonstrates just how efficient, sustainable and luxurious electromobility can be"".

The design is expected to form the basis for cars going on sale in 2024 or 2025, although Markus Schafer, the chief technology officer, declined to specify when the 1,000 km-range battery would be ready for production.

""We will likely be the first to show a 1,000 km-range car in real life, with such a small battery,"" he said.

Mercedes needed to determine what range buyers expected and how much they are willing to pay before deciding when to start selling a car like the Vision EQXX, Mr Schafer added.

The prototype comes less than two months after Chinese carmaker GAC Group unveiled its Axion LX Plus SUV, which it claims will be able to travel 626 miles on one charge.

In September, California EV start-up Lucid started producing its 500-plus-mile range Air.

Major carmakers have been overhauling their operations to produce electric vehicles in line with the shift away from fossil fuels, with several countries planning to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. The UK will ban such sales from 2030.

In July, Mercedes-Benz announced plans to invest more than $47bn (£34bn) by 2030 to take on Tesla and wind down spending on fossil fuel engine technology this decade.

The Vision EQXX also features an interior made using sustainable materials including mushrooms, bamboo, cactus and vegan silk.

""These show that it is still possible to achieve the utmost in automotive luxury without using animal products, whilst creating an inimitable feeling of premium comfort. This fascinating journey has halved the carbon footprint of the leather alone,"" Mercedes said.

The prototype comes as BMW appeared to have overtaken its arch rival in the global sales race for the first time since 2015.

Pieter Nota, BMW's sales chief, wrote on LinkedIn: ""Proudly claiming number one position in the global premium automotive segment for the BMW brand in 2021.""

The car marker will not report its annual sales figures until January 12, a spokeswoman said, but BMW delivered 1.7m vehicles for the first nine months of 2021, beating Mercedes-Benz by more than 112,000 vehicles.

BMW has been less affected by the global semiconductor shortage that has snarled production lines globally.

Mercedes said on Monday that supply problems will continue to affect the industry during the first half of this year.","{'uri': 'telegraph.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","[{'uri': 'rachel_millard@telegraph.co.uk', 'name': 'Rachel Millard', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2022/01/04/TELEMMGLPICT000281982434_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqHCA3F9HS2BgNUkuR3-jFZdyOV3NmMOLW4n50kLBwID8.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,0.1529411764705881,eng-7380045,False,0.5568627715110779,0.1529411764705881,379003920,1

[EPA-EFE/DAVE MUSTAINE]

The enemy of Putin's Russia is stability, and its real interest is the constant maintenance of tensions, if necessary with occasional military actions so that it remains a factor that you must call if you want a solution, writes Orhan Dragaš.

Dr Orhan Dragaš from the International Security Institute is the author of the books ""Two faces of globalisation - truth and deceptions"" and ""Post-Truth in South-East Europe"".

Unresolved problems in the Balkans are often compared to the crisis between Russia and Ukraine. There are reasons for that and even arguments that will help you make a seemingly good parallel and draw the same conclusions from them. But still, be careful with that.

It is true - both in the Balkans and in connection with Ukraine, the centre of the problems are territorial and ethnic disputes, which go far back in history. There was already an armed conflict in both places, and the ground has not calmed down yet, so both regions are post-conflict zones that are looking for a careful solution for long-lasting peace. Finally, both crises are highly internationalised, the conflict is on the West-Russia line and directly involves rivalry between Washington and Moscow.

Countless analytical texts and reports have been written on these parallels, the same arguments have been discussed at professional conferences, and so on for years.

Why not, when these few elements give space for experts to draw attention with their lucid analyses and assessments? But let us ask ourselves - are they the right help to better understand both crisis areas or are they something completely different?

Are, perhaps, Ukraine now, and the Balkans for three decades, an Eldorado for the army of international experts who build careers on them, attached to various funds, living in fear that these conflicts will end, because who will then listen (and finance) their lucid parallels, analyses, and forecasts?

Therefore, among experts, it is not surprising that the prognosis of the cataclysmic outcome of the Ukrainian crisis is very widespread, just as we have been hearing announcements about a new hell in the Balkans from more or less the same authors for years. I am afraid we will disappoint them here.

One must always keep in mind that Putin's Russia is built on the return of the sense of empire and that it is searching for its identity. In making that narrative, it is demanded that Ukraine be kept at Russia's side, even at the cost of world peace.

This goal and the price list are set by the Russian president, which he has already confirmed with his aggressive moves towards Crimea, the Sea of Azov, and now through the crisis in Donbas.

He knows that Ukraine is special, that the Russian Empire was built in Kyiv, the cradle of all Russian cities. He also knows that the two countries are like two brothers who despise each other - Russia is younger and stronger, and Ukraine is older, which is why it cannot challenge it to an open fight.

For Putin, however, it is frustrating to know that he cannot afford to annex the whole of Ukraine. The consoling goal is, therefore, a vassal and loyal, formally independent Ukraine that will serve as a sociological trench around the ""empire"", similar to those that Russian rulers have dug around their cities in the past.

Russia needs a satellite Ukraine, something like Belarus, so that the Kremlin can show its subjects that ""empire"" is not a fairy tale and that it really exists, at least as a stage set.

That is why the fear of a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine was used to intimidate European politicians, who were convinced that the war would lead to a massive influx of refugees into Europe. At the same time, to make this fear more credible and unacceptable to European politicians, Russia has occasionally changed the scenario by introducing a tactical nuclear strike on Europe.

Russia has at least four options on how to keep Ukraine. The first and most expensive and somewhat dramatic is the invasion of Ukraine. The second is to elect a president loyal to Russia and compromised by Russia. The third is to include in Ukrainian political life a group loyal to Russia and dangerous for Ukraine with the right to vote and the right to veto in the Ukrainian parliament. And the fourth is the special status for the region in Ukraine controlled by Russia.

The invasion of Ukraine is the least possible scenario for many reasons. It will be very difficult for Russia to bear the cost of the war with a country of 50 million people near its border, and at the same time, face massive Western sanctions. We are moving away from this option even more after the recent talks between Presidents Biden and Putin, and especially the upcoming talks between high diplomats of the two countries in Geneva this month.

Russia will surely cultivate, nurture, and compromise Ukrainian politicians in the long run, hoping that Ukraine will elect a pro-Russian president and parliament once again.

At the same time, Russia will work on reintroducing the separatist Ukrainian territories into the Ukrainian political and social narrative so that this new parliamentary faction would block all initiatives for joining NATO.

If Russia will move its troops to Ukraine at all, it will be only to justify its current presence in the separatist region of Donbas. The possible granting of an internationally recognised special status to the territory in Donbas, which was occupied by Russia, may indicate the formation of a permanent Russian military base in Donbas.

This military arrangement can receive a NATO response by opening the possibility for the Alliance to be present in Ukraine on a temporary and conditional basis, without permanent NATO membership for Ukraine. In this way, the great military presence of the two rivals would bring balance to the territory of Ukraine, and that in itself would even lead to the consolidation of opportunities.

Here we come to a really important parallel between the crisis in the Balkans and the crisis in Ukraine, because Russian strategic interest is at the centre. Namely, in none of these areas does Russia want an outcome or a long-term stable solution.

Its real interest is the constant maintenance of tensions, if necessary with occasional military actions, so that it remains a factor that you must call if you want a solution. And when you call, then you have to offer something.

The victims of this Kremlin strategy are, in this case, Ukraine and the Balkans. That is why possible ""prey"" in Ukraine will be bitter, just like in the Balkans, because both crises are going in a direction that Russia essentially does not want, and that is long-term stability.

It will have to accept such a reality because there are not enough resources for the fairy-tale one - imperial and glittering. There are neither financial nor military, and especially democratic and human. That will be enough for the other side because it has shown that it has all those resources, which can discourage Russian aggression. Ukraine and its gradual exit from the crisis will best confirm that.

So, things are not going in the direction of a cataclysm, just like in the Balkans. That is good news, except for those who planned to live on the crisis in these two regions for many more years.","{'uri': 'euractiv.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'EurActiv.com'}",[],https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Donetsk-flag--800x450.jpg,,,False,0,,379003620,3

Detained Tunisian ex-justice minister Noureddine Bhiri of the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, who is refusing food or medication after his transfer to hospital, is suspected of ""terrorism"", the interior minister said Monday.

Bhiri, deputy president of Ennahdha - viewed by President Kais Saied as an enemy - was arrested by plainclothes officers Friday and his whereabouts were initially unknown.

Ennahdha had played a central role in Tunisian politics until a power grab by President Kais Saied last year.

Tunisia was the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago, but civil society groups and Saied's opponents have expressed fear of a slide back to authoritarianism a decade after the revolution that toppled longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

""There were fears of acts of terrorism targeting the country's security and we had to act,"" Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine said late Monday of the arrest.

A member of a delegation that visited Bhiri in hospital told AFP on Monday that he was refusing food or medication.

On Sunday activists and a former Ennahdha legislator said Bhiri was in a critical condition and facing death.

But the source told AFP that Bhiri, 63, is ""not in critical condition for the time being"".

The source, asking not to be named, said that a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the United Nations rights commission visited Bhiri at hospital in the northern town of Bizerte on Sunday.

He is ""lively and lucid"", and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward.

'Kidnapping' charge

Since Friday, however, Bhiri has ""refused to take any food or medication, prompting his transfer to hospital"" two days later, the source said.

Samir Dilou, a lawyer and ex-Ennahdha MP, condemned Bhiri's arrest as ""political"" and an abuse of the justice system.

He told a Tunis news conference that he is lodging a ""kidnapping"" charge against Saied and the interior minister Charfeddine.

The interior minister said late Monday that evidence had been sent to the justice ministry regarding Bhiri's activities, but that the prosecution ""delayed"" action on the matter.

This, Charfeddine said, prompted him to ""quickly apply... judicial control"" over Bhiri, in a context where he was suspected of ""falsifying"" identity papers, including for a Syrian woman.

The interior minister said he had ""personally verified"" that the detainee was being ""treated well"".

Bhiri's wife, Saida Akremi, also a lawyer, told reporters he had suffered ""a heart attack"", and that she was being denied access to him because she refused to sign documents as demanded by security services.

Mondher Ounissi, a doctor and member of Ennahdha's executive bureau, said Sunday that Bhiri suffers from several chronic illnesses, including diabetes and hypertension.

He has been ""deprived of his medication"" and ""his life is threatened"", Ounissi said, adding that Bhiri usually takes 16 pills a day.

READ | Detained Tunisian politician hospitalised 'in critical condition'

The interior ministry on Friday said that two individuals had been ordered under house arrest, without identifying them.

It said the move was a ""preventive measure dictated by the need to preserve national security"".

The anti-torture group INPT has identified the second person detained as Fathi Baldi, a former interior ministry official.

The president ""bears full responsibility for the life of Mr Bhiri"", the anti-Saied group ""Citizens against the coup"" said Sunday on Twitter.

It said he had been ""rushed to the hospital in a very serious condition"".

Saied on July 25 sacked the Ennahdha-supported government and suspended parliament, presenting himself as the ultimate interpreter of the constitution.

He later took steps to rule by decree, and in early December vowed to press on with reforms to the political system.","{'uri': 'news24.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'news24'}",[],https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1711/d612a52649f74bffb5d4efd9629300ac.jpg,-0.2941176470588235,eng-7377822,False,0.9058823585510254,-0.2941176470588235,379003500,1

Tesla posts record fourth quarter and full year sales,"(CNN) -- Tesla bucked the industry-wide trend of reduced sales due to the shortage of computer chips and other parts, posting record sales in the fourth quarter, up 71% from a year earlier.

The strong fourth quarter of 308,600 vehicles gave Tesla full-year sales of 936,000, up 87% from the 2020 total, and above the 900,000 mark that had been the target set by many analysts.

""Taking a step back, with the chip shortage a major overhang on the auto space and logistical issues globally these delivery numbers were jaw dropping,"" Dan Ives, analyst for Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients Sunday. He said Wall Street forecasts of 265,000 Tesla sales in the fourth quarter would have taken full-year sales to 892,000. The 900,000 sales target that Tesla easily cleared was a ""best case number in the eyes of the street,"" according to Ives.

Other automakers are all expected to report reduced fourth-quarter sales when they release US numbers this coming week. Tesla reports only global sales, but industrywide, global auto sales are expected to be broadly lower in the fourth quarter.

Cox Automotive is forecasting that overall US fourth quarter sales will be down 24% due to the shortage of computer chips that caused plants to temporarily shut, limited the inventory of vehicles in dealerships and drove up car prices to record levels.

""The industry ran out of vehicles, and sales stalled in the second half,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, chief economist for Cox Automotive. ""Total sales in the second-half of 2021 were the slowest in a decade. Demand is healthy, but supply and production disruptions kept the industry in check. You can't sell what you don't have.""

Tesla had its own chip shortage issues during the year but was able to manage through them. The EV maker's achievement was more impressive considering that it is facing increased competition from traditional automakers now offering more electric vehicle models.

For example, the Ford Mustang Mach-E had US sales of nearly 25,000 vehicles through November in its first year on the market. Ford recently announced plans to triple production to meet demand. There are also new EV-only automakers now selling vehicles, including Lucid and Rivian, which both recently won MotorTrend's car and truck of the year honors.

So while Telsa's share of the EV market might be declining somewhat in the face of new competition, the demand for EVs is growing even faster, allowing Tesla to continue to report strong growth.

""While there are many competitors in the EV space, Tesla continues to dominate market share as evidenced again this quarter while battling through the chip shortage,"" Ives said.

Tesla has forecast that with new factories near Austin, Texas, and Berlin about to start full-scale production in 2022, it should have annual global sales growth of 50% or better for at least the next few years.

Investors have rewarded Tesla, lifting its share price 52% in 2021. While that's modest compared to the 743% gain shares achieved in 2020, it was still better than most automakers, including most other EV-only companies. And it was enough to give Tesla a market value greater than the combined value of the 12 largest global automakers, and to make it only the sixth company ever to be worth more than $1 trillion.

All-terrain vehicles are primarily subdivided into two categories: the type I category includes all-terrain vehicles intended for use by a single rider with no passenger and type II ATVs are designed for use by a rider along with the passenger. Type II ATVs are equipped with a designated seating position behind the rider. All-terrain vehicles are best known for their maneuverability in rough terrain and off-road capabilities. The sturdy vehicle design allows better protection from harsh operating environments as compared to conventional vehicles. All-terrain vehicles have applications in sports, forestry, surveying, agriculture, and military and defense. ATVs have gained popularity over the past few years as they enable access to remote areas and rough terrains and offer a convenient way to carry equipment and supplies. All-terrain vehicles are mainly used in off-road environments; however, in recent years, several regions have permitted the use of these vehicles on public roads as well. According to a report from Grand View Research, the global all-terrain vehicle market size was valued at USD 3.9 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.1% from 2019 to 2025. Active EV stocks in news today include: Volcon Inc. (NASDAQ:VLCN), Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI), Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), ElectraMeccanica Vehicles Corp. (NASDAQ:SOLO), Arcimoto, Inc. (NASDAQ:FUV).

The growing popularity of outdoor entertainment activities such as off-road sports activities, increasing number of trails and adventure parks, and high demand for all-terrain vehicles for military and agricultural applications are key factors driving the market growth. Increasing purchasing power and disposable income in developed, as well as emerging economies, are expected to drive the demand for all-terrain vehicles over the forecast period. The demand for all-terrain vehicles has increased in the agricultural sector for various farm-related applications such as weed control, field plowing, fence mending, animal handling, and general transportation. All-terrain vehicles are versatile and are also used in applications such as construction, manufacturing, utilities, search and rescue, and mining. Prominent companies are providing sponsorships and organizing off-road racing events and adventure sports events to gain higher product visibility and acquire new customers. Demand for gasoline ATVs is increasing owing to higher demand in military and sports applications. Heavy-duty all-terrain vehicles are primarily equipped with diesel engines, as they are used for powerful towing and material handling applications. Electric all-terrain vehicles are gaining popularity in North America and Europe as an alternative for ATVs operating on gasoline and diesel. Environmental concerns and fluctuating prices of diesel and gasoline are the factors that are expected to drive the demand for electric vehicles globally. The introduction of more powerful electric motors provides a performance advantage to electric ATVs to compete with gasoline and diesel variants. The former has a quiet engine and are hence considered suitable for activities such as hunting and wildlife rescue.

""Since the beginning we've said that Volcon off-road products are a great fit for the terrain and recreational needs of Central and South America,"" said Jordan Davis, Chief Executive Officer of Volcon. ""The Grunt is perfect for eco-friendly riding on a ranch, in the woods, or for resort-ready fun. So it's with great pride that we make these first customer shipments to Latin America, as they are a proof point that we're moving into the next phase of our international expansion plans.""

Latin America is an important market for Volcon, and the interest from consumers in the region was reflected in a recent event held in Mexico City, in which approximately 100 guests attended a family-friendly demo ride gathering. Attendees were able to experience the easy-to-ride capabilities and near-silent electric motor of the Volcon Grunt in a welcoming atmosphere. The event showcased the accessibility of the Grunt - a motorcycle with no clutch or gears that anyone with bicycle experience can easily ride - as well as the power of electric propulsion and the forward-thinking sustainable design that Volcon has created.

As Volcon expands into new product categories in 2022, including the introduction of four-wheeled models, potential demonstration events will continue throughout Latin America. CONTINUED... Read this full press release for VLCN by visiting: https://www.financialnewsmedia.com/news-vlcn/

First previewed at CES in 2018, where it won the IHS Markit Innovation Award, the SOLO EV redefines the idea of personal urban transportation. Today, almost 80 percent of U.S. daily commutes are done alone in gas-powered passenger vehicles. Not only is this inefficient - leaving three or more empty seats in each car - it also a major environmental concern. Purpose-built around today's drivers, ElectraMeccanica's SOLO EVs provide a much-needed tech-forward, eco-friendly solution that addresses the empty space between micro-mobility (like bikes and scooters) and traditional transportation.

The largest journeys can often begin with small steps.

New York City-based rental car startup, Joulez, knows that, and while it is starting small, it is aiming high in what is currently a niche market -- the rental of electric vehicles (EVs).

It may be niche right now but, according to Joulez, the overall vehicle rental market is expected to be worth about $214 billion by 2027, and it is counting on younger demographics driving up demand for greener vehicles as part of that growth.

The company is the brainchild of Micah Bergdale, founder of mass transit payment solutions company, Bytemark, now owned by Siemens AG (OTC: SIEGY). It took delivery of its first Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) vehicle Sept. 21 and has since acquired more. Joulez also has open orders to add Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID) vehicles to its fleet in 2022.

As well as uniquely focusing on the EV rental market -- the sector makes up less than 1% of the current rental market -- Joulez is also counting on superior customer service to help get more customers in and up its revenue.

That's because many potential customers want to try EVs but might not have the knowledge required to enjoy the rental experience, and Joulez wants to be there every step of the way to ensure the experience is enjoyable for every customer. Such service includes delivering the vehicle to the customer, which avoids the dreaded waiting-in-line rental car experience, and providing video interaction during the rental to ensure any potential problems will be dealt with.

With major rental companies such as Avis Budget Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CAR) and Hertz Corp. (NASDAQ: HTZWW) recently announcing they will focus more on the EV rental market, the challenge for a new entrant to gain a significant foothold and generate healthy revenue might be a steep one.

One way Joulez is hoping to build such revenue is to not just offer its own fleet for rental. It is also developing a software platform to partner with 3rd party-owned EVs and rent them for a management fee, similar to how SuperHosts manage fleets on platforms like Turo. Joulez has set up EV charging accounts with Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ: BLNK) in addition to utilizing Tesla SuperChargers to help expand access to charging for EV renters.

The company is also planning to rely on what it sees as a healthier resale value of EVs. Such resales have outperformed those of regular gasoline-powered vehicles and are expected to continue to do so, Joulez says.

Such resales will build revenue and retain asset value while helping finance the company's expansion plans.

Joulez cars can already be seen on the streets of New York City. The company is aiming to expand across the United States and Canada before eventually exploring other international opportunities.

Joulez, which is running a crowdfunding investment campaign on StartEngine, says it is renting its vehicles for an average of about $175 per day. It has various rental revenue rates depending on the length of time a vehicle is rented.

Apple $3T, Trading AMD and Marvell","Reading the environment. It's not easy. So much to read into what is and what might be. So much to take away. Spotting tracks in some mud. Big cat tracks? Canine? How pronounced are the toes on the paws? Are the claws visible? Are they still fresh? Filled with water? Are you tracking the beast? Are you sure there's just one? Are they moving quickly? Or are you so close as to be able to be watched yourself? So much. Just from the shape of a print, or the damage caused to the foliage that the print or prints seem headed into. Sure? Never sure. A series of educated estimates (not guesses). Never guesses. On Monday, not everyone, but a whole lot of participants returned to the marketplace. Treasury markets would steal the show after opening in New York as there had been no overnight trade Sunday into Monday due to foreign market closures. Bond traders sold their market hard, the long end of the curve especially so. The U.S. 10- Year Note has paid just less than 1.64% early this morning, up from 1.496% late Friday night. The 30-Year Bond yields more than 2.03% as I write. Both levels are the highest seen, or lowest prices for these products, since pre-Thanksgiving November. Traders sold the short end as well, but not as severely. As the yield for U.S. 10-Year Note did this... ...the yield spread between the U.S. 10-Year and the U.S. 3-Month T-Bill did this... ...and the yield spread between the U.S. 10-Year Note and U.S. 2-Year Note showed a little less severity in relative depth of movement, but movement nonetheless... Are there takeaways here? Is there something to see? Why such sharp movement in Treasury securities? Why such a generally positive day for equities, which we'll get to in a minute or two? Markets are pricing in, at least for now, both a growing economy and controlled inflation (as long as Treasuries don't do this repetitively). In other words, markets think that this Omicron variant will not slow demand (or perhaps supplies of both goods and services) as sharply as previously feared. You may not trust the Fed, and I would not blame you for whatever you thought, but the market is saying at least for now... that ""the Fed's got this."" How Do We Know? We really don't. I could get my bat on the ball in the 90 MPH cage. You would think I was a good hitter if you didn't know me. Only had a few at bats in my life against minor-league quality pitchers. They easily made short work of me at the plate. I could not touch a well-thrown curve ball. A lot of guys can not. Problem here, There are always curves. As it appears, at least anecdotally, that the Omicron variant is less lethal and presents less severely than its ancestors, regulators here in the U.S. suggest that maybe folks do not have to miss so much work if they do not feel sick. Sure, on Monday, the U.S. set a new record with more than one million new infections, and airlines continue to cancel thousands of flights due to a lack of available personnel (as airline stocks, but not their aircraft soar). Medical clinics are closing their doors all over the New York area, not because they are afraid to treat the sick, but because the good people who work there have tested positive. Not that sports are important, but they are visible. Both the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League have been canceling games every night because one or both teams can not field enough players. Then there are the schools. While newly inaugurated New York City Mayor Eric Adams is out publicly announcing that the city's public school system will remain open, his counterparts in cities such as Milwaukee, Cleveland, Detroit, across the state of New Jersey and elsewhere are either canceling school this week or taking schooling online. That circles us back to what has plagued U.S. labor markets since we first were introduced to the initial variant of this virus. Two-earner households who can not afford to or can not make other arrangements are forced to forego the second producer's income in order to keep someone at home with school-aged children. When your line at the grocer or the pharmacy is longer than you can imagine, and the person working in the place of two or three seems more than frazzled, this is why. Back to the financial markets, because they seem to be telling us that what we see before our eyes is not what we'll see moving forward. Markets, and let's hope they are correct, are pricing in a rapid Omicron surge that plants the seeds of herd immunity deeply in and broadly across the population at reduced (although not inexpensive) cost in terms of human suffering. Equities The first thing I see as I look at Monday's equity market performance are three cyclical sectors atop the daily S&P sector-select SPDR ETF standings as Energy ( ( XLE) ) gained 3.1%, Consumer Discretionaries gained 2.87%, and the Financials ( ( XLF) ) popped for 1.23%. Those three sectors were followed by the two ""growthy"" type groups. The Tech ( ( XLK) ) sector finished in fourth place at +0.95%, but that is misleading. Within that sector, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index increased some 2.05%, which would be reflective of expectations for economic growth. However, also within that sector, the Dow Jones US Software Index surrendered 0.87% for the day. which would suggest higher interest rates. Defensive sectors took three of the bottom four places on Monday, which was a stark reversal in chosen allocation from what was experienced across the marketplace for the past week or two. Trading volume, while not yet closing in on existing moving averages, did come back to life on Monday. Winners beat losers by four to three at the NYSE and by almost five to two at the Nasdaq. Advancing volume comprised 70.2% of NYSE composite volume for the day, which was up 45.3% from Friday and up 39,1% from last Monday. For Nasdaq domiciled names, advancing volume comprised 75.8% of the Nasdaq composite (not the index) volume for the day, which was up 30.9% from last Friday and up 17.6% from last Monday. In other words, there was certainly an increased degree of professional accumulation expressed in terms of price discovery on Monday. Interestingly, the autos were truly hot, and it was not just Tesla ( TSLA) , up more than 13%, or Lucid ( LCID) , up more than 7%. Legacy automakers Ford Motor ( F) and General Motors ( GM) gained 4.8% and 4.3%, respectively for the session. Just a Kiss Remember way back in October when Microsoft ( MSFT) briefly claimed the title of world's most valuable public company? On Monday, Microsoft closed at a market cap just north of $2.5T. Not even close. Apple ( AAPL) first became a $1T company in August 2018. It took another two years for Apple to hit the $2T mark. On Monday, less than three and a half years after hitting $1T, Apple for a moment, as the share price grazed $182.86 (The daily high was $182.88) was worth $3T. Though APPL closed at $182.01, I see the shares trading with a $183 handle overseas as I work on this morning note. ""Own it, don't trade it."" That's what they say. They certainly weren't wrong. New Price Targets On Monday, Goldman Sachs five-star (at TipRanks) analyst Toshiya Hari named Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD) and Marvell Technology ( MRVL) as his top two semiconductor picks for 2022. Later on Monday, I told Nicole Petallides on the TD Ameritrade Network, that I like Nvidia ( NVDA) as well, but right now I favor those same two names going forward too (I am and have been long all three for some time). Hari feels that Wall Street underappreciates the gains that AMD has made in the data center, and that for Marvell, data center gains plus 5G and automotive are not properly priced in. I'll tell you what I see on top of that. For AMD, I see a strong balance sheet and stable cash flows as well as short interest comprising 6% of the entire float. I see a current ratio of more than two. Very impressive. For Marvell, I do see a lot of debt, and a tougher environment for margin. Both stocks trade close to 55 times forward-looking earnings, which would be expensive if the world was not starved for more of what they sell. I see a CEO in Lisa Su of AMD who has miraculously turned that firm around, leaving Intel ( INTC) in the dust, and competing at the highest levels with Nvidia. I also see a CEO, Matthew Murphy of MRVL, who is starting to look like he understands whose example to follow here. He is well into turning Marvell around. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) With AMD, readers will see that through November into early December, I thought I was probably looking at a ""bull flag,"" which would be special enough. That flag turned into the left side of a cup that has now developed a right side with a $157 pivot and now a handle. The pivot has to be taken, but should that happen, the possibility of a breakout enhances exponentially. Target Price: $188 Pivot: $157 Panic: $141 ($1 below the 50 day SMA) Marvell Technology (MRVL) For MRVL, we see an almost similar-looking chart, although the cup is short and more shallow, thus less convincing for MRVL. I will have to be cautious here because MRVL popped on earnings and left an unfilled gap between $72 and $80. Does that gap have to be filled? Usually. Not always, but usually. In other words, if this stock sees $79, I am not sticking around to see if it hits $72. For the moment, though, we have to think that the cup with handle pattern might be real and that the group could move together.

VR can make that happen.,"At first, nothing seemed amiss in the Spinoza Cafe. The virtual cafeteria, designed by Dutch scientists, was replete with fluorescent lights, cheap gray carpet, and vending machines.13 university students, equipped with virtual reality goggles, entered the cafe. Soon after, though, they faced a series of increasingly bizarre experiences: The clocks began running backwards, patrons turned their heads to stare, gravity failed. The students, who were participants in a research study, were instructed to ask themselves a question again and again: ""Am I dreaming?""

Scientists designed the simulation as practice for lucid dreaming -- a state in which the dreamer recognizes that they are actually asleep. They hypothesized that once the students found themselves inside a real dream, perhaps as bizarre and disjointed as the Spinoza Cafe, they'd remember they were sleeping -- and open a door to a different, rare kind of consciousness.

Lucid dreaming is more than just self awareness. People who lucid dream gain memories of what happened earlier in the dream, the ability to manipulate their environment, control their own actions, and marvel at how strange their dream worlds are. Psychologists compare it to a fully immersive virtual reality inside our own heads, which we have the ability to program and reprogram. ""You plug into your extended self,"" says Benjamin Baird, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. And the practice seems to have very real therapeutic applications -- lucid dreams may help people conquer debilitating nightly terrors caused by nightmare disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, and might even help others work through their day-time demons. Now, psychologists and neuroscientists, like those behind the Spinoza Cafe study, which was recently published in the journal, Philosophical Transactions B, are trying to figure out one important detail first: How do you induce lucid dreaming?

When we fall asleep, it may seem like our brains power down for the night, but they actually just shift into a different mode. Certain parts of the brain -- those involved in emotion and vision in particular -- actually become much more active. That's why dreams are so emotionally and visually vivid, Baird says. Meanwhile, the parts of our brain involved in higher-order thought -- which includes self-awareness, agency, and the ability to plan ahead -- go off duty. The lack of activity in these areas of the brain, called the frontal-parietal network, might explain why dreams often feel like they're happening to us, almost like a movie, rather than shifting with each action and decision we make, like real life, Baird says.

What happens in the brain when our dreams turn lucid is much less clear. To understand which parts of the brain are involved in certain tasks, scientists usually turn to fMRI, a large device that measures changes in blood flow inside the brain, which can indicate which parts of the brain are more active than others. To date, there exists only one case study in which scientists got a participant to lucid dream inside an fMRI machine. Based on that one case study, scientists observed increased activity in the frontal-parietal network, compared to non-lucid dreaming -- suggesting that lucid dreamers are able to turn on that part of the brain, and the capacity for higher-order thought, that normally is dormant at night. Scientists have also studied the brains of people who report frequent lucid dreams outside of the lab, Baird says. Similarly, these people demonstrate increased connectivity between neurons in the frontal-parietal network. ""It's intriguing,"" Baird says, but direct observations of only one person aren't generalizable, and scientists haven't determined whether lucid dreaming is connected to the structural differences observed in the brains of frequent lucid dreamers. ""It's early days in this field,"" Baird says, ""the evidence is pretty weak.""

[Related: This pseudoscience movement wants to wipe germs from existence]

Psychologists can say with more certainty that lucid dreaming tends to happen during REM sleep, the last of four sleep stages, which cycle about every 90 minutes. As the night goes on, each successive period of REM sleep becomes longer and deeper, so the most vivid dreaming experiences often take place towards early morning, in the liminal space between sleep and wake, Baird says.

Scientists have tried a host of different methods to induce lucid dreams. For example, researchers have created computerized face-masks that recognize when a person's in REM sleep and flash colored lights that ideally enter their dream and remind them that they are asleep -- a method that, in one small group of dreamers, helped induce lucid dreams in half of participants compared to only 17 percent who didn't use sleep masks.They've also tried drugs that block and bind to the neurotransmitters involved in REM sleep, causing them to build up in the brain during sleep. Baird and colleagues observed these pharmacological methods raise rates of lucid dreaming to 42 percent compared to a group of people who trained to lucid dream without medication. But all of this research needs further replication, Baird says. ""It's such a rare state and so difficult to achieve,"" adds Martin Dresler, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior.

Some of the tried and true techniques to induce lucid dreaming are more low-tech. In one, the dreamer simply asks themselves ""is this a dream?"" whenever, during waking hours, they're in a place or situation that appears frequently in their actual dreams. Dresler and his colleagues, who co-authored the recent study on virtual reality and lucid dreaming, adapted this method in their design of the Spinoza Cafe. ""The idea was, well, let's just make it as realistic as possible, but still as dreamlike as possible,"" Dresler says, ""And virtual reality is the perfect tool for doing exactly that.""

The apparent effect of VR on our dreams might have to do with the fact that VR, like a dream, does an eerily good job of mimicking reality, says Claudia Picard-Deland, a PhD student in neuroscience at the University of Montreal. In a study published in 2020 in the journal Consciousness and Cognition, she and her team studied whether a VR flying simulation could train people to have flying dreams, compared to people who played games on a Wii. They found that people who trained using VR not only experienced more flying dreams, but had more lucid control over those dreams. ""It feels so real that they forget where their real body is,"" she said. VR is a form of ""reality checking,"" -- measuring one's experience against reality -- and that's one of the keys to lucid dreaming, she says. ""When you're in a VR experience, you're constantly questioning your reality,"" Picard-Deland said. In other words, by transferring one mantra to our dream world's -- this is a dream, this is a dream, this is a dream -- it might be possible to transform those worlds into a VR playground.

For the Spinoza cafe study, the research team had the students return to the cafe six times over two weeks. For another two weeks, the students trained with a range of other virtual reality games, which the researchers selected to be as dreamlike as possible. Throughout that time, plus the weeks preceding and week after, they kept a dream diary. Finally, the students underwent three at-home sleep studies with a device that recorded their eye movement. Participants were told to move their eyes in a specific pattern -- left, right, left, right -- as soon as they realized they were dreaming, a method that's common among lucid-dreaming research.

By the end of the study, 12 of the 13 people who went to Spinoza Cafe reported experiencing lucid dreams. Three of those lucid dreams were confirmed by the participants' eye movements. Meanwhile, only four people in a separate group who trained using the traditional technique -- asking themselves ""am I dreaming?"" without VR -- reported lucid dreams. None of those experiences were independently confirmed in the sleep study. Finally, in a group that didn't train at all, no one reported lucid dreams.

It wasn't the first study to suggest an association between entering virtual worlds and experiencing lucid dreaming. Decades ago, scientists observed that playing video games makes people more likely to experience lucid dreams, possibly because of the immersive quality of games. Still, we need a lot more research before we can say that VR or videogames can help us lucid dream, Baird says. They should include more participants and more precise methods for measuring lucidity.

Lucid dreaming is more than a VR playground -- it's a promising treatment avenue for people who regularly experience horrors in their sleep. For between three and seven percent of the population, regular nightmares get in the way of day-to-day functioning. In some cases, nightmare disorder makes people afraid to sleep, causes depression and anxiety, and leads to suicidal thoughts. Cracking the code to lucid dreaming could give these people an escape hatch from the terrifying situations they face in their sleep or even manipulate nightmare landscapes to be less horrifying.

Baird is most hopeful about the therapeutic applications outside of nightmare research. Imagine working with a therapist to plan your next dream, then using the dream to work with your memories and beliefs in a way that waking consciousness doesn't allow. You might use lucid dreaming to confront a person who has caused you harm in the past. You could talk to the actors in your dreams to try and understand what thoughts and concerns they represent. Baird acknowledges that there's no scientific research on this therapeutic potential, outside of nightmare disorder, ""but we've heard over and over again, this has been transformative for people,"" Baird says, ""People have an opportunity to actually work with the psychological content of their dream in real time.""","{'uri': 'popsci.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Popular Science'}","[{'uri': 'isobel_whitcomb@popsci.com', 'name': 'Isobel Whitcomb', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.popsci.com/uploads/2022/01/03/Wellness_VR.jpg?auto=webp,0.0117647058823529,,False,0,0.0117647058823529,378998820,51

Boston-based commercial electric vehicle startup Indigo Technologies is introducing two new designs at CES 2022 in Las Vegas, the Flow ride-sharing vehicle and Flow Plus delivery van.

Founded by Ian Hunter, an MIT professor and inventor of the first so-called robotic wheel with integrated electric suspension and propulsion, Indigo Technologies aims to deliver ""an entirely new class of smooth, roomy and affordable electric vehicles"" with these two new models.

It plans to do so by equipping the EVs with its breakthrough robotic wheels, which are said to enable a significantly smoother ride, more space, and lower operating costs than any other vehicles in their class. The company claims the Flow and Flow Plus will be ""markedly better"" in all of these areas compared to the Toyota RAV4 and the Ford Transit Connect, respectively.

Despite the bold claim, Indigo is not that generous with the details. It does say that both the Flow and Flow Plus will offer more than 250 miles (402 km) of range with only a 40 kWh battery.

""Indigo invented robotic wheels that uniquely enable more space and comfort for small urban EVs. Without the transmission and motor between the wheels, Indigo Flow has a low, flat floor that provides more cargo space than any vehicle of its size. And the active suspension in each wheel makes for an amazing ride comfort at an affordable price that people will love.""

Will Graylin, CEO of Indigo

Looking at the images -- which appear to be renderings rather than photos of actual vehicles -- it's pretty clear the Flow and Flow Plus feature identical front ends up to the B-pillars. From there on, the vehicles go separate ways, with the longer Flow Plus adopting a van body and the Flow looking like a small minivan with two big sliding doors on each side.

The images also reveal an interesting interior layout for the ride-sharing vehicle, which features a central driving position pushed as far forward as possible. There's a sizeable digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel that includes almost all the controls (even the gear selector) and several storage spaces under the dash on each side.

Two different seating configurations are showcased, one with two individual seats on the second row and a generous cargo area behind them, and another with three seats on the second row and two additional seats on the third row.

We'll keep an eye on Indigo Technologies to see if it follows up with functional prototypes and production vehicles, but until then we should note that the company recently recruited Volker Kaese, former Audi head of innovation product management, as chief technology officer.

The engineer, who led development of the Volkswagen XL1 and Audi e-tron show cars, is joined at Indigo by Eric Obers, formerly design leader at Porsche and Lucid, and Hugh Robinson, previously at Porsche and General Motors, to lead design for the Flow product line.","{'uri': 'uk.motor1.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Motor1.com'}",[],https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/bg68pm/s3/indigo-flow-plus-and-indigo-flow-electric-vehicles-2.jpg,0.1215686274509804,eng-7381616,False,0.7137255072593689,0.1215686274509804,378997980,1

But the Rivian R1T isn't perfect. No vehicle is. It could be better. Here's how.

The Rivian R1T has a 400-volt electrical architecture, at least for now. It's enough and it enables peak fast-charging speeds in excess of 200 kw. But vehicles that have the fastest charging rates run on faster, more future-proofed, 800-volt systems. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scarinage, has said multiple times that the R1T's peak charging rate will increase via over-the-air (OTA) software updates in the future to rise above 300 kw. The timeline for this increase is unknown. To get there, Scarinage told Motor Authority's sister site, Green Car Reports, in 2018 the team ""architected everything in the system to see higher voltages at the right time."" It'll require some hardware changes, but it's in the future plans. The Porsche Taycan, Audi E-Tron GT, Hyundai Ioniq 5, and Lucid Air all have faster peak charging rates thanks to their 800-volt systems.

Apple CarPlay (and Android Auto)

Rivian doesn't offer Apple CarPlay or Android Auto in the R1T. We'd ding any vehicle for lacking these very useful features that let people bring the capabilities of their smartphones into their vehicles. A Rivian spokesperson confirmed the company has no current plans to integrate either system into the R1T. Having spent time with the truck, I can understand why Rivian would favor its native system given how it's layered with sliding tabs and drawers. Adding ACP or AA would make things messier for Rivian. That doesn't mean it couldn't be done. It just wasn't. Sorry, no Waze for you, Rivian drivers.

The Rivian R1T doesn't have a heat pump. A fancy explanation was given as to why, but it was jargon that boils down to, ""we don't have one."" Heat pumps have limited, but important, functionality. They make the most difference in cold, but not frigid, temperatures with their ability to make the cabin, or battery, heat up quicker. Notably, heat pumps take about 20 minutes to kick in and really make themselves useful. They don't really come into play for short trips around town. But most importantly, while it's not reflected in EPA range ratings, they can extend a vehicle's range in cold weather on a longer trip. In a vehicle like the Polestar 2, the heat pump can add up to 10% to the range, which could be the difference on a road trip between making it to a fast charger and getting stranded on the side of the road. It's an odd omission for a vehicle designed and marketed for adventure in all climates and conditions.

Is that even possible? Our team wasn't aligned on this. Senior Editor Robert Duffer felt the system, which can be configured with nearly 50 different drive modes, might be a bit much, especially for off-road purposes. Rivian provides five drive modes -- All-Purpose, Sport, Offroad, Conserve, and Towing -- and each mode has sub modes. Layer in settings for ride height, adaptive dampers, regen braking, and stability control within sub modes, and the R1T offers a lot of control for those who want to tinker. The default All-Purpose mode straddles the middle of all these settings. I fell in love with Rally mode within the Offroad mode because its stability control programming let the rear end hang out, but even that wasn't perfect for running the equivalent of a rally stage due to too much brake pedal travel to instill confidence the brakes would be there while going into a corner with speed.

It's hard to say the Rivian R1T isn't efficient, especially for a pickup truck. It's all electric with zero emissions. With the standard 21-inch wheels and all-season tires, it has an EPA-rated range of 314 miles. That decreases with the optional 22-inch wheels and summer tires or 20-inch wheels and all-terrain tires. Regardless of wheels and tires, at about 7,000 lb the Rivian is the second least efficient electric vehicle on the market in the U.S., coming in second only to the atrociously heavy -- over 9,000 lb -- GMC Hummer EV with its bigger 200-kwh battery pack and 329 miles of range. The Rivian delivers 2.32 miles of EPA range per kwh. For reference, the reasonably inefficient Audi E-Tron offers 2.56 miles of EPA range per kwh while the Hummer gets 1.64 miles and the most efficient EV on the market, the Lucid Air Grand Touring gets 4.60 miles.

The Rivian R1T has a few more physical controls than a Tesla, but not many. Rivian clearly paid attention to the interface and control setup in Teslas, for better and worse. Want a volume knob? Yeah, not going to happen. Looking for a switch for the temperature controls or fan speed? This isn't an F-150. You'll have to locate the controls on the touchscreen. However, essential functions like headlight operation and windshield wiper speed can be controlled by little toggle switches atop the turn signal stalk. That's stuff you won't find in a Tesla Model 3 or Y. Controls to move the mirrors, steering wheel, and vents don't necessarily need to be separate because they are rarely used. Alexa voice assistant is built in to handle such functions as changing the temperature or music. But a volume knob would be nice. Even Volvos have a volume knob in their minimalist interiors.

Most of these complaints are small, and none of them would keep us from putting a Rivian in our garage. Some of them could be corrected in future updates, whether it be running hardware changes or even over-the-air updates.

In the end, the Rivian R1T is hands down the most versatile vehicle we've ever driven with uncompromised off-road capability and fantastic on-road performance. Those strengths made the Rivian R1T's the Motor Authority Best Car To Buy 2022, and these few minor complaints didn't even factor into that decision.","{'uri': 'motorauthority.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Motor Authority'}","[{'uri': 'joel_feder@motorauthority.com', 'name': 'Joel Feder', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://images.hgmsites.net/hug/2022-rivian-r1t_100819380_h.jpg,0.1215686274509804,eng-7380498,False,0.7372549176216125,0.1215686274509804,378997920,3

Electric vehicle start-up Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) was one of 2021's most anticipated special purpose acquisition (SPAC) stocks. Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) success has drawn much attention to the electric vehicle (EV) industry, where investors are looking for the next big thing.

Lucid is in the early stages of building out its manufacturing capabilities, but the positive reception of the company's first vehicle model, the Lucid Air, has investors thinking big. Could Lucid be one of 2022's biggest winners and reach a whopping $100 per share? Let's investigate.

Lucid has a little bit of Tesla in its DNA. CEO Peter Rawlinson used to work for Tesla; he was a chief engineer for its flagship car, the Tesla Model S. Given Tesla's success, it might not be surprising to see Rawlinson crafting Lucid's strategy to resemble his former employer's.

Like Tesla, Lucid is starting upmarket, aiming to break into the automotive industry with a high-end model. The Lucid Air is just that, starting at a price of approximately $77,000 and ranging up to $169,000. The company has an SUV model planned to begin deliveries in 2023 and uses a direct sales approach like Tesla's instead of working through dealerships like most incumbent automakers.

The company laid out an aggressive ramp-up schedule when the stock went public, estimating vehicle deliveries growing from 20,000 in 2022 to 251,000 in 2026, generating revenue of $22.7 billion that year.

Lucid's role as a luxury brand could limit the kinds of commercial opportunities that Tesla (Semi and Model 3) and Rivian (which makes delivery vans for Amazon) have taken advantage of, meaning Lucid could live or die by the consumer market. Fortunately, the Lucid Air is off to a great start; it has received accolades and an impressive 520-mile EPA rating.

The tricky part is that a hyped stock requires that investors make some assumptions about how the business will perform in the future. If Lucid were to meet its 2022 estimates, the resulting $2.2 billion in revenue pales in comparison to the stock's hefty $64 billion market cap.

The stock's forward price-to-sales ratio is nearing 30, topping Tesla's P/S of 20 despite Lucid having much to prove at this point. One could argue that a smaller and faster-growing competitor might command a premium valuation once it demonstrates its ability to meet delivery estimates, so what would $100 per share look like from a valuation perspective?

The share price is currently just under $40, so if the stock traded at $100, the resulting market cap would be in the $164 billion range, making that P/S ratio more like 74, and it is still 30 if we use management's 2023 revenue guide of $5.5 billion. Is this possible? Of course, though it would likely take an irrational price movement for the stock price to reach this high, and it might remind one of a bubble instead of a sound investment. Therefore, I believe it's doubtful that Lucid can reach this price in the next 12 months, except under very bubble-like conditions. But I do think it could eventually legitimately get there.

Investors might want to be careful not to assume that Lucid will earn the same valuation as Tesla. While Lucid is a much smaller company at this point and will likely see faster growth as production ramps up, Tesla is the proven leader in electric vehicles and has created additional value through its self-driving technology. Lucid appears to be a ways off from having a comparable level of autonomous capability.

The stock needs an approximately $164 billion market cap to hit $100 per share, so I can create some scenarios using Lucid's revenue estimates. For reference, Lucid is projecting revenue as follows:

Tesla's P/S ratio has fluctuated over the past three years, so I will look at Lucid using three valuations: P/S ratios of 10, 20, and 30.

If the stock commands a P/S of 10, Lucid will achieve a $100 share price sometime in 2026. For a P/S of 20, this happens in 2024. Finally, a P/S of 30 would likely push Lucid to $100 per share by late 2023.

What's ultimately important is that investors tamp down their expectations; there is a lot of execution risk in Lucid's stock because the company is so young. It has to prove the demand for its vehicles and meet that demand by executing on manufacturing. The assumptions above also exclude the possibility of new shares being issued in the future to raise funds.

There is a lot to like in Lucid, and early feedback on the Lucid Air is promising. However, there are a lot of ""what ifs"" in justifying a $100 share price in the near term, so investors should approach the stock with a long-term mindset and conservative expectations.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'justin_pope@fool.com', 'name': 'Justin Pope', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/658412/gettyimages-1341392219.jpg,0.3411764705882352,eng-7381244,False,0.8352941274642944,0.3411764705882352,378997320,40

Despite the recent move to the upside and coming off the back of a debut year in which the stock gained more than 260%, analysts are divided on their outlook for the path Lucid will go in 2022 as they provide their predictions as the new year gets underway.

LCID is now trading in the center of its 52-week range; the short-term trend is neutral, although the long-term trend is positive. In the last month, LCID has been trading in the region of $35.53 to $47.25, a rather broad range; it is now trading in the center of this range, which suggests that traders may find some resistance above the current price.

Significantly reduced volumes have been noted in the previous couple of days, and with prices stabilizing recently, Lucid has shown a good setup pattern in recent weeks. At $38.27, there is a support zone below the current price of $40.93, and traders might put a Stop Loss order below this area.

In addition, we have seen that significant players have shown an interest in LCID in the last few days, which is a positive indicator. The Effective Volume indicator monitors the behavior of significant players, which examines the 1 minute period in search of transactions with a high volume.

On the other hand, the S&P 500 Index is now trading around fresh highs, indicating that LCID is behind the market.

Despite Lucid trailing the market, four Wall Street analysts have set a high price objective of $60 for Lucid's stock for the next 12 months and a low price goal of $16 for the firm in the same period. On average, analysts estimate LCID to trade at $42.75, representing a 4.45% increase in value over the stock's current trading price of $40.93.

There is mixed sentiment about the stock's future prospects, with one TipRank expert advising to 'Sell.' At the same time, another urges to 'Hold.' Notably, two of the four analysts advocate to 'Buy' the stock although its consensus rating remains hold.

Recently, we reported that LCID closed its debut year with over 260% gains despite turbulent markets. Now, in 2022, Wall Street will be on the lookout for indications of further improvement in the highly competitive EV sector as Lucid approaches its next earnings release date.

Analysts will first look to see If there have been any recent changes to analyst expectations for Lucid. Typically, these alterations reflect the most recent short-term business developments, which may change quickly. If the company is confident in its business prospects, then upward estimate revisions signify that confidence.

Citi restarted coverage of the electric car firm on Monday afternoon trading, giving it a ""Buy/High Risk"" rating with Analyst Itay Michaeli, giving the stock a Buy rating and a price target of $57.

The firm said that it is upgrading its model to incorporate a recent capital raising but that it has made no modifications to its original premise.

Notably, back in September, when Lucid was trading around $20, Michaeli was bullish, giving LCID a Buy rating of $28. The analyst's latest $57 price objective places Lucid at about $100 billion market capitalization. In such a case, it would become one of the most valuable automotive firms in the world.

The analyst wrote in a report released Monday:

""We are constructive on the Lucid story and its position in the EV/Car of the Future theme.""

In his opinion, Lucid boasts industry-leading range and charging capabilities, in addition to robust, internally designed self-driving technologies, among other things.

The company highlighted its EV technology credentials, advantages in terms of speed-to-market with Lucid's first car, the Air, and an innovative and complete sensor suite as reasons for its decision. Nevertheless, Citi said that Lucid must effectively handle manufacturing ramp-ups in order to remain profitable.","{'uri': 'finbold.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Finbold'}",[],https://finbold.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lucid-stock-outlook-for-2022-Analysts-are-split-on-LCID.jpg,0.4274509803921569,eng-7381244,False,0.686274528503418,0.4274509803921569,378997020,20

This is the all-electric Vision EQXX, a solar-powered car with a 648-mile range per charge!

On CES 2022, Mercedes unveiled a car concept which challenges the Tesla EV dominance. The Vision EQXX currently holds the record for ""EV with most miles on a single charge,"" overcoming the limits of Lucid Motors (520 miles per charge) and Tesla (402 miles per charge).

Be warned that these numbers are based on Mercedes' computer simulated testing. The car is yet to be manufactured for real road testing.

Mercedes announced this new car with a lot of style and hype. The video reveal for Vision EQXX is embedded directly below.

The video description said to ""get ready for electric range and efficiency on an entirely new level! Mercedes-Benz is determined to lead the way into an all-electric future. The VISION EQXX is the result of a mission we set for ourselves: to break through technological barriers across the board and to take energy efficiency to new heights.""

Daily Mail compared the Vision EQXX's specs to the popular Tesla Model S Long Range. Based on estimates, the Vision EQXX would travel almost three times faster than the Tesla, with an energy consumption of less than 10 kWh per 100 km (approximately six miles per kWh).

Admittedly, the Vision EQXX shows a lot of promise. Note that its energy consumption and milage are only some of its unique features.

According to Daily Mail, Vision EQXX is designed to be ""more aerodynamic than a football,"" which could boost speeds with less energy costs. On top of its utility, the car still maintains a minimalistic feel and luxurious design.

Its interior features a giant 47.5-inch touchscreen, which spans the entire dashboard. Mercedes representatives said the car's program would include AI technology, providing drivers with directions and suggestions.

Mercedes also mentioned that they are working with a company called NAVIS Automotive Systems. Together, they plan to develop the first real-time 3D navigation system, which could significantly improve the cruising experience. Ideally, it will provide ""seamless zoom and scroll functions"" from a satellite view down approximately 10 meters from the ground.

Lastly, Mercedes boasted that the EV uses recyclable materials, implying it has a really small environmental footprint. Its leather is reportedly made from underground root-like structures of mushrooms, and its carpets are made of bamboo fibers.

Its construction material also uses elements found from landfill waste, specifically known as UBQ. For reference, UBQ is a mixture of plastic, cardboard, gardening waste, and even diapers.

Another was only half-fulfilled: Mark Wood did get more Tests - seven in the calendar year, the most for him since 2015 - but appeared only once against India and was perplexingly rested in Adelaide last month, just when his speed was unsettling Australia's best batters. Still, as the players say, we go again. Here are six wishes for 2022.

1) England reset

Joe Root, who has been wrong about most things in Australia, is right about this. England need to rethink their red-ball cricket, just as they did with the white-ball game in 2015. That operation had two masterminds: Andrew Strauss, England's then managing director, who saw the need for it, and Eoin Morgan, the incoming white-ball captain, who made it happen by turning a team with no identity into fearless master-blasters.

Transforming the Test team will take brains. The squad needs a natural captain, someone steely and crafty, not smiley and woolly. And the whole set-up needs a boss with more vision and verve than Ashley Giles, who has made his mark only by getting rid of the biggest brain in the England brains trust, Ed Smith. As national selector, Smith had a win/loss ratio in Tests of 1.75 (won 21, lost 12). His successor, Chris Silverwood, has a ratio of 0.17 (won one, lost six). The fixture list has been tough, the Covid protocols taxing, but that's still a steep decline.

Giles's job should revert to Strauss, who relinquished it for personal reasons when his wife Ruth was dying of cancer. If he's only available part-time, the ECB can say ""No problem"". It's a job that mainly consists of hiring people for other jobs lower down, though Strauss has the clarity and clout to change the mindset of those above him, too. He might even persuade them to turn down those mind-boggling bonuses.

Yes, there's another one coming up, only a year after the last. In October Australia, the surprise winners, will defend the trophy on their own soil in what should be a more satisfying tournament. In the UAE last autumn the toss held too much sway: all six of Australia's victories came batting second. By the end they were probably playing well enough to win batting first, but they never got to prove it. England, the only team to beat them, started sublimely but ran out of steam, lost Jason Roy to injury and succumbed to New Zealand in the semi-final. That should spur them on, along with the knowledge that they can still be the first men's team to hold both World Cups at once.

3) England win the Ashes

The women's Ashes, that is. The series covers all three international formats, a scenario England's men can only envy. It begins on 26 January with a single Test, followed by three T20s and three ODIs. Australia's women rule the world, so wresting the Ashes from them on their own turf is mission almost impossible. But the England captain, Heather Knight, has a gifted squad who have now been battle-hardened by the big crowds in the Hundred. And they have plenty more to play for later in the year. Straight after the Ashes, there's the World Cup in New Zealand, with England arriving as the holders. Halfway through the home season come the Commonwealth Games (in Birmingham, from 28 July), which will feature T20 cricket for the first time - with no men to hog the headlines.

A month ago Yorkshire seemed to be finally cleaning out the stables after their dismal response to Azeem Rafiq's allegations of racism. They laid off all their coaching staff and brought in Darren Gough as managing director of cricket. Since then it's gone all quiet on the northern front. This could be because the players threatened to quit: Gough may be talking to them behind closed doors. Let's hope that if push comes to shove he is prepared to let them go and start afresh, building a new team around Adil Rashid, who is too good not to be playing four-day cricket (assuming his shoulder can stand it). And let's hope the rest of English cricket becomes more inclusive. Every team, professional or amateur, can help by taking the knee. Sky can help by giving the commentary spot vacated by David Lloyd to Mark Butcher, not just because he's mixed-race, but because he's top-class - shrewd, lucid and witty.

5) England work out how to play New Zealand

If you can't beat 'em, copy 'em. Morgan's blueprint for buccaneering was borrowed from his mate Brendon McCullum, the then New Zealand captain. And in Tests these days the Kiwis are everything Root's England are not: canny, efficient, clear-thinking. They are the only team Root has never beaten as captain (played six; lost three, drawn three), and they're coming over again for three Tests in June. We don't know who will be in charge of England by then, but we do know that they'll have to work out how to deal with Tim Southee's swing, Kyle Jamieson's bounce and Neil Wagner's belligerence - and how to ape New Zealand's ability to punch above their weight.

6) Jofra Archer comes steaming in

England's most exciting discovery since Ben Stokes hasn't played for them since March and if he goes to the Caribbean this winter, it'll just be to see his family. Archer will soon have lost a whole year to a stress fracture of the right elbow. Some people have doubted whether he will ever play another Test, but the man himself doesn't seem to be among them. Speaking to Australia's Channel 7 at the start of the Ashes, Archer said: ""This is really one cricket tour as a fast bowler that you don't want to miss."" Quizzed about his recuperation, he insisted: ""Everything's been moving forward nicely."" He'll be back. The question is when - and in how many formats.

We'll get our first clues at this week's CES electronics show in Las Vegas. That is, unless the high transmissibility of the omicron variant of the coronavirus makes a massive in-person gathering completely impossible. Big-name attendees including Intel, Meta and Amazon have already pulled out.

Some of the developments we'll discuss are long overdue. Some build on progress or change we saw in 2021.

In many ways, 2022 will be a year of ""hurry up and wait,"" Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst with research firm Creative Strategies, told us. Big-tech developments such as ""the metaverse,"" autonomous vehicles and greater repairability will take time to catch up to their hype, and companies must be careful not to overpromise, Milanesi said.

At the same time, companies need our buy-in more than ever. Smart-home technology, health wearables, and virtual reality all depend on our personal data to improve.

Here's what we expect -- and in some cases, hope -- to see in 2022.

Facebook parent company Meta may have generated the most buzz with its foray into the metaverse -- a theoretical shared space where people can hang out in virtual reality -- but the other tech giants won't be far behind.

2022 will be a ""race into the metaverse"" as large tech companies wrestle for slices of an emerging market, said Rolf Illenberger, CEO of virtual reality software maker VRdirect. Google, Microsoft and Apple may introduce their own headsets and operating systems for the metaverse, like their equivalents for PCs and smartphones.

The giants aren't alone, either: In recent years, parts of the CES floor have become a playground for start-ups building augmented and virtual reality headsets, and many are eager to make their mark on the metaverse. Meanwhile, there's another hurdle the industry will need to clear. Companies developing software that runs in the metaverse would have to make sure those programs play nicely with different operating systems.

As for the rest of us, our first steps into the metaverse will probably be for our jobs. The pandemic is pushing companies toward virtual reality for onboarding, training and meetings.

If you walk into a big-box retailer or hardware store, it probably wouldn't take you long to find smart-home goodies such as connected lightbulbs and thermostats. What can take awhile is finding stuff that works with the products you already have -- but that might not be the case for much longer.

Some of the biggest names in Big Tech, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung, have teamed up to develop a new smart-home standard called Matter. The aim: to ensure that the home gadgets you buy in the future all play nice with one another, regardless of who made them or what virtual assistant you want to use when interacting with them.

""Today, when you look at a smart-home-connected device, you have to look at what ecosystem it works with,"" said Erik Kay, a vice president of engineering at Google. ""Where we're going with Matter is that you don't have to think about any of that.""

This year, electric vehicles will transition from cutting edge to standard issue -- if you live somewhere with the infrastructure to support EV charging.

Electric models from household names including Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen will make EVs accessible to more people at lower prices. Market leader Tesla will continue expanding, and such start-ups as Lucid and Rivian will elbow their way into the fray.

And shoppers will be able to choose from electric vehicles beyond the traditional sedan, with Volkswagen expanding the availability of its family-size ID.4 and Ford introducing an electric F-150 truck. Tesla's divisive Cybertruck could even hit the market in 2022. But one thing could delay these mainstream moves.

A prolonged chip shortage has upended the way automakers churn out new vehicles, driven up prices of televisions, and made hot products such as Sony's PlayStation 5 nearly impossible to buy.

The effects of the shortage probably won't start to fade until the back half of 2022, said Syed Alam, managing director at Accenture Strategy. And that's the best-case scenario.

Sudden changes -- like, say, the emergence of a new variant -- could throw a wrench into recovery plans.

In the meantime, Intel, Samsung and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have announced plans to build chip plants in the United States, and they should help protect these companies -- plus others that rely on them -- from wild swings in chip availability. The problem is, these kinds of facilities take years to go live, so it's unlikely they'll be able to make a dent in the situation anytime soon.

Phones, laptops, tablets -- we rely on gadgets like these every day, but companies haven't exactly made them easy to fix when things go wrong. Slowly but surely, it seems that might be starting to change.

Apple, which for years maintained strict control over how its products could be fixed, will roll out a self-service repair program in early 2022. The move will allow enthusiastic amateurs to access the parts and guides to fix their iPhones and Mac computers.

Apple isn't alone. In October -- shortly after it unveiled a flashy, hard-to-upgrade Surface laptop -- Microsoft announced plans to increase the options that consumers have to repair their devices by the end of 2022. Meanwhile, Dell is experimenting with ""circular"" design, starting with a concept it calls Luna. It might look like a regular laptop, but fewer internal screws and a rejiggered design make it easier to pull apart and fix or upgrade than some other PCs.

Clinicians are already starting to use individual biometric data -- data from our bodies -- to prevent, diagnose and treat health problems. With more health wearables measuring our hearts, lungs, sleep, steps, calories and even sweat, we'll start doing the same at home. In 2022, you may use a ring on your finger to see how regular cardio exercise affects your sleep, or a bracelet to monitor your blood pressure.

Health wearables also generate huge amounts of personal medical data that's not protected by existing medical privacy laws such as HIPAA, so it's hard to know for sure where all that data will end up. There are also big hurdles when it comes to sharing that data with our health-care providers in ways they can easily parse.

Customers have good reason to be skeptical. In 2021, security breaches, data privacy problems, and AI whistleblowers dominated technology news.

In 2022, companies will try to regain lost trust with a variety of tactics, such as creating high-ranking roles in charge of ""digital trust,"" offering cash rewards to people who identify bias in AI systems, and adopting technologies that partially anonymize personal data, Forrester research predicts.

Companies will get hungrier for ""first-party"" data -- data we share with them directly. The more we trust companies to handle our personal data and shape our experiences with algorithms, the more they can monetize that trust through ""personalized"" experiences and advertisements.","{'uri': 'inquirer.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Philadelphia Inquirer'}","[{'uri': 'tatum_hunter@inquirer.com', 'name': 'Tatum Hunter', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'chris_velazco@inquirer.com', 'name': 'Chris Velazco', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/0mrZ--DVxE1wlFAoP7BoE5PSMno=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/7DY5O3JY55DPNK4R6UOVIHYXCA.png,0.192156862745098,,True,0,0.192156862745098,378994620,1

The numbers never lie. See for yourself with the following electric vehicle (EV) delivery numbers...

What do they say about the state of the EV Revolution in 2022?

What do you think? Up 71%... 50%... 130%... 181%... What do those numbers say about the EV Revolution today?

It's pretty obvious. They're proof that the revolution in electric vehicles is accelerating - not decelerating - and that 2022 will be a breakout year for EV stocks.

So what exactly is driving this breakout?

Well, in short, all the stars are finally aligning for the mass uptake of electric vehicles this year.

For starters, EVs are finally cheaper than gas-powered cars.

An April 2021 report from the U.S. Department of Energy found that the all-in lifetime cost for a gas-fueled car is about $95,000, while the all-in lifetime cost for a similar EV is about $90,000.

That $95,000 figure will rise in 2022, because of soaring fuel prices, while the $90,000 number will drop, because of economies of scale and falling battery costs - which, of course, means that in 2022, the delta in all-in lifetime costs between an EV and a gas-powered car will reach all-time highs, in favor of EVs.

So, the economic drivers have shown up to the party. Prospective car buyers looking for the ""best buy"" are going to increasingly gravitate toward electric vehicles in 2022.

Meanwhile, the technological drivers have shown up, too.

Historically speaking, EVs have been limited by driving ranges and technological prowess. That's no longer true.

Case-in-point: Lucid Motors unveiled its signature Lucid Air vehicle in late 2021, which features 500 miles of range (more than a gas-powered car) and has more horsepower than any Lamborghini ever made.

That's just one example. But it's a microcosm of the improving technology phenomenon sweeping across the industry. In 2022, the average driving range of an EV is projected to hit 275 miles - which is on-par with the average driving range of a gas-powered car.

Beyond that, prospective car buyers are going to have more EV options to chose from than ever before in 2022.

Not only are legacy automakers across the price spectrum - like Ford, GM, Mercedes, and BMW - launching dozens of new EV models in 2022, but multiple EV startups like Lucid, Rivian, Canoo, Arrival, and more will start actively delivering their EVs to consumers in 2022, too.

Basically, if you went into a car dealership in 2020 or 2021, you were greeted by a few EV models on the floor. In 2022, the floor will be dominated by EVs. That's all you'll see.

Oh, and there's also the $2 trillion Build Back Better plan that's working its way through Capitol Hill. That bill includes $550 billion in clean energy spending - the bulk of which will go to incentivizing electric vehicle uptake via expanding tax subsidies and boosting charging infrastructure.

It's the largest-ever EV spending initiative ever proposed in Washington D.C. - and it could pass in 2022.

Falling costs. Improving technology. More supply. And potentially $550 billion worth of legal tailwinds. What more could you want?

The EV Revolution is going to go mainstream in 2022. Electric vehicle adoption is going to soar like never before this year - and EV stocks are going to skyrocket hundreds of percent.

But, if you're like me, you aren't looking to make 100%, or even 300% gains in the EV Revolution. This is a once-in-a-lifetime, multi-trillion dollar paradigm shift, which, if you invest in it correctly, could forever change your financial future.

And that's why I found one, tiny $3 stock at the epicenter of the EV Revolution...

A completely unheard-of tech startup that is pioneering a ""Forever Battery"" breakthrough which has the potential to change everything about the EV Revolution...

With a stock that could soar 1,000% or more in the coming years.

It's clear that the upside potential in this tiny stock is enormous - so big, in fact, that I can't write its name in this post.

But I did just give a presentation at the landmark Hudson Theater in Southern California, where I told an exclusive group of 60 people all about this tiny tech stock.

Global strategists at JPMorgan, led by Mislav Matejka, say there is further upside for stocks, as the omicron coronavirus variant is milder than prior ones, and Chinese deceleration is behind us. They also say that consensus projections for 2022 earnings will again prove too low.

A less favorable outlook comes from Matt King, global market strategist at Citi.

Compared with the Taylor Rule estimate of where rates should be, Federal Reserve policy may be at its most stimulative ever, and even in emerging markets, the average policy rate when adjusted for inflation is negative. This stimulation has helped boost inflation, which central banks are now trying to tackle.

Two extraordinary years of central bank distortion are now largely over, and lately equity performance has lagged behind inflation-adjusted, or real, yields, but been in line with slowing money creation.

For markets, King says, the flow of money creation is more important than the level of money available. Liquidity is no longer floating all boats, he says, pointing out the outperformance of equities over credit, developed markets over emerging, and passive over actively managed funds.

The flatness of the yield curve, King says, shows markets are much closer to late-cycle than the economy. And what will be neutral interest rates for the economy are likely to be higher than what is a neutral rate for markets, he says.

Even if the consensus is correct that real yields will rise while inflation softens, this is a combination unfavorable for risky assets, he says. ""Staying too long in crowded spaces is a surefire recipe for infection,"" he says.

Tesla closed Monday at $1199.78, up $143, in heavier-than-normal trading volume.

The stock got a boost after releasing unit sales data for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2021.

On Sunday, the company said it delivered 308,600 vehicles worldwide in the quarter, ahead of analyst expectations for 263,000 vehicles. For the full year, Tesla delivered 936,000 vehicles, up 87% over 2020.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called the quarter a ""jaw-dropper"" and added that the company is set up for strong momentum for this year.

On December 19, Ives boosted his price target on Tesla to a range of $1,100 to $1,400, rating the stock ""outperform,"" according to MarketBeat analyst data.

One key advantage in a year when other automakers suffered through semiconductor shortages: Tesla was developing its own chips. In its second-quarter report earlier this year, the company said, ""Our electrical and firmware engineering teams remain hard at work designing, developing and validating 19 new variants of controllers in response to ongoing semiconductor shortages.""

Tesla notched a return of 49.76% in 2021. Its market capitalization is now $1.2049 trillion, joining Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) as the only U.S.-listed stocks whose value exceeds $1 trillion.

The stock etched a double-bottom base with a buy point above $1201.95. In Monday's session, shares rallied as high as $1201.07. If you're using a strict definition of passing a buy point, you can wait until shares cross the $1202 threshold, but given not only the powerful sales momentum but also investor sentiment, I consider Tesla buyable at this point. Even if it pulls back in the days ahead, the stock seems likely to rally in the coming months.

However, Tesla was not the biggest electric vehicle gainer in 2021, nor the biggest-gaining automaker.

Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) officially went public in late July through a merger with SPAC Churchill Capital. When rumors about the merger emerged in mid-January, SPAC shares began taking off. In a case of ""buy the rumor, sell the news,"" shares sold off nearly 39% on February 23 when the deal was officially announced.

In the past three months, Lucid shares are up 66.31%. Since the IPO on July 26, the stock's price is up 53%.

Lucid, too, has potential for investors, although it's not in a buy zone now, as it's been consolidating since late November. Its luxury vehicle, the Lucid Air, was named the 2022 MotorTrend car of the year. On Monday, On Jan. 3, Green Car Reports said the Air was its ""Best Car To Buy 2022.""

Lucid stock jumped 7.57% Monday, closing at $40.93 in light turnover.

The company has taken orders for more than 17,000 cars and expects to deliver around 20,000 cars this year, with production ramping up at the company's Arizona manufacturing facility.

Negatives include a charging network that's not as built-out as Tesla's, which should come as a surprise to no one at this point.

When it comes to the best-performing big automaker stock in 2021, that honor goes to Ford Motor (NYSE: F), which returned 137.43% for the year.

Despite a pandemic-induced revenue decline, Ford is galloping ahead in the EV race, with its electric Ford Mustang. Forget the muscle cars of old; the electric Mustang is a crossover vehicle. Sales have been good so far, and Ford plans to roll out an electric version of its popular F-150 pickup truck this year.

Ford shares started 2022 gapping higher to a 4.81% gain, closing at $21.77. It's trading at its best levels in more than 20 years. Ford is currently in a buy zone, having successfully tested its 50-day line in December.

Nonetheless, the momentum right now goes to Tesla. With its trading history and market capitalization, it's less more of a proven entity than a smaller stock like Lucid. While Ford looks promising, Tesla's vehicle delivery numbers make it a more compelling buy right now.

EVs have a very big presence at this year's CES conference in Las Vegas. Among the automakers showcasing new cars and technology is Mercedes-Benz, which has a brand new concept car that promises absolutely mind-blowing range.

Apparently the Mercedes Vision EQXX can travel a crazy 620 miles of range without stopping to recharge. Should it ever make it to the production line, that's a figure that puts the likes of Tesla Model S and the 520-mile Lucid Air Dream to shame.

That's enough to drive from Paris to Berlin, or New York to Cincinnati, Ohio. It's also enough to travel the entire length of the U.K. (around 600 miles), provided you were able to drive in a straight line.

This is a concept, so unfortunately the car doesn't actually exist in the real world. Still Mercedes' simulations show that this car only needs 10 kWh of power to travel 100km (62 miles), which the automaker claims is equivalent to burning 1 liter (0.26 gallons) of fossil-fuel.

The EQXX also has solar panels on the roof, which are supposed to add up to 15 miles of range over the course of a long-distance journey. However, right now Mercedes is only promising that solar will power secondary features, like climate control and the infotainment system from a separate battery, rather than adding that power to the main power pack.

Still things like heaters and A/C need a lot of power, so minimizing their impact on the main battery will be a boost to your range.

The Vision EQXX has a 100 kWh battery, the same as the Mercedes EQS, though it promises to be half the size and 30% lighter than Mercedes' current flagship EV. That lower weight means less power is needed for getting you around, and the smaller size means there's more room for other stuff; not that EVs are particularly spartan right now.

The car itself weighs just 3,858 pounds, and has been optimized for maximum aerodynamic performance -- both of which will help the car cut through the air using as little power as possible. Mercedes claims the EQXX is more aerodynamic than a soccer ball, and has a drag coefficient of 0.17. Soccer balls are usually around 0.20.

For comparison the EQS and Lucid Air Dream Edition have a drag coefficient of 0.20. The Tesla Model S Plaid, which Tesla claims is the ""lowest drag car on earth"" clocks in at 0.208.

Of course, it wouldn't be a Mercedes without the luxury in-car experience. That's why the EQXX packs in a 47.5-inch mini-LED screen, with 8K resolution, which spans the entire width of the car's cabin -- much like the Hyperscreen inside the EQS. But this is a single continuous display, rather than three separate panels.

'Hey Mercedes' voice control is also included, and the interior is made up of vegan mushroom leather that Mercedes claims can be grown with 100% renewable energy.

Obviously this is a concept design, which means the EQXX isn't going to be hitting the roads anytime soon. It also means we couldn't speculate on price, though there's no doubt that it would be priced at the higher end of the premium EV market. After all, the EQS starts at $102,310, and that doesn't have quite as much to offer.

Whether the EQXX makes it to mass production or not, the features it offers could still make their way to future Mercedes EVs.

In fact, Mercedes claims that some of its features are already being integrated into production. I just hope that smaller battery starts being installed in other cars soon, because range is still more important than all the other frivolous luxuries electric cars have to offer.","{'uri': 'tomsguide.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': ""Tom's Guide""}","[{'uri': 'tom_pritchard@tomsguide.com', 'name': 'Tom Pritchard', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMNPRzxyfjzqaSLJjSXVMb-1200-80.jpg,0.07450980392156858,eng-7380045,False,0.7333333492279053,0.07450980392156858,378991500,3

""They build cars, but they're basically building an iPhone on wheels. And so the entire infrastructure that they've been building around service, for example, has been a big challenge for them. They've innovated some amazing things like mobile service.""

In reality, little or no has materially slowed Tesla's ascent -- not even Elon Musk's tax-related inventory sale that quickly put downward strain on the shares.

In a word to purchasers on Monday, Garrett Nelson, senior fairness analyst at CFRA Research, boosted Tesla's inventory to a Buy from a Hold and hiked the 12-month value goal to $1,250/share.

He identified that Tesla's 2021 beneficial properties underperformed opponents like Lucid's (LCID) 280% growth and Ford's (F) 136% surge, however "" the completion of new factories in Texas and Germany sets the stage for further growth in 2022 and beyond.""

The EV maker is more and more fashionable in Europe, with Electrek reporting Norwegians have adopted its cars at a breathtaking pace. But China's huge market is the place Tesla's current and future lie -- as does a possible stumbling block for its ambitions.

In a report published on Monday, The Wall Street Journal underscored how the firm's opening of a new showroom in Xinjiang, a area at the middle of genocide allegations towards the Chinese authorities, militates towards Musk's picture as an iconoclastic rule breaker who incessantly tangles with U.S. elected officers on Twitter.

The Xinjiang quandary is one Tesla additionally shares with a rising variety of company American powerhouses like Nike (NKE), Walmart (WMT), Intel (INTC) -- and sure, Apple. The Morning Brief has beforehand coated the multitude of ways wherein Beijing's domestic woes, and its unique brand of geopolitical hardball, have ensnared the Sino-American bilateral relationship in a thicket of recriminations and tensions.

While China is a large a part of Tesla's success, it additionally has the potential to inflict reputational harm on its model as worldwide furor towards Beijing grows extra acute.

It additionally exposes the rising contradiction of American corporations forced into a game of ""go along to get along"" with the Chinese authorities, whilst they take more and more polarizing social stances at house -- whereas paying just about no political penalty for doing so.

(AFP)

With terrorism-related charges levelled at one of its senior members, Tunisia's Ennahda party has found itself suddenly on the defensive.

""There were fears of acts of terrorism targeting the country's security and we had to act,"" Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine said late Monday of the arrests.

Although two Ennahda members have been subjected to the ""preventive measure"" applied by the ministry of interior, most of the attention has so far been on Noureddine Bhiri, deputy president of Ennahdha and former minister of justice, who was detained Friday and held under house arrest before being taken to a hospital in the northern city of Bizerte.

Ennahda's media has focused on Bhiri highlighting concerns over his health under arrest and the absence of any official information about the move from the authorities.

The interior minister said that evidence had been initially sent to the justice ministry regarding Bhiri's activities, but that the prosecution had ""delayed"" legal action on the case.

This, Charfeddine said, prompted the house arrest Bhiri over security concerns.

Ennahda's number-two man, explained the interior minister, was suspected of involvement in falsifying identity papers and nationality documents and of unlawfully granting a Tunisian passport to a Syrian female national.

The second person detained since Friday was identified as Fathi Baldi, a senior Ennahda member and a former interior ministry official described by Tunisian sources as part of the Islamist party ""security apparatus"".

Tunisian analysts said the information released by the interior minister could lead to the opening of the probe about allegations of Ennahda's involvement in facilitating the travel of Tunisian jihadists to Syria and its connections with extremist networks.

Ennahda, the leading party in the Tunisian parliament, whose activities were suspended last July 25 by President Kais Saied, has always denied any such accusations.

The Islamist party has led the opposition to Saied since he invoked Article 80 of the constitution to put in place ""exceptional measures"" allowing him to rule by decree.

The Tunisian president has since announced elections for next December, to be preceded by a referendum.

The legal case against Bhiri and Baldi opens a new chapter in the political showdown between Saied and Ennahda's leader Rached Ghannouchi. It also adds more pressure on Islamists from other political protagonists and public opinion at large.

Charfeddine promised that future revelations about the individuals involved in the Bhidi-Baldi case ""will prove to be shocking""

The interior ministry had said on Friday that two men, whom it did not identify, had been placed under house arrest added the move was a ""preventive measure dictated by the need to preserve national security"".

Charfeddine's press conference changed the focus of Tunisia's political conversation from legal and human rights concerns about Bhiri's health condition to allegations about terrorism-related activities.

On Sunday, Ennahda activists claimed Bhiri, who was refusing food and medication, was in a ""critical condition"" and ""facing death"".

Such concerns were in great part dispelled after the head of the Tunisian bar association as well as a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the United Nations Human Rights Commission visited Bhiri at the Bizerte hospital, Friday and Sunday.

He is ""lively and lucid"" and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward, a source told AFP.

The interior minister said on Monday he had ""personally verified"" that the detainee was being ""treated well"".

Samir Dilou, a lawyer and ex-Ennahdha MP, condemned Bhiri's arrest as ""political"" and an abuse of the justice system.

He told a Tunis news conference that he is lodging a ""kidnapping"" charge against Saied and the interior minister Charfeddine.

The minister of interior said the ministry would press charges against individuals suspected of calls on security services for ""disobedience"".","{'uri': 'thearabweekly.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'AW'}",[],http://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image_800x450_/public/2022-01/2022-01-04_10-45-56_502511.jpg?itok=9fnTU-U9,-0.1607843137254902,eng-7377822,False,0.6039215922355652,-0.1607843137254902,378990420,1

He pointed out that Tesla's 2021 gains underperformed competitors like Lucid's (LCID) 280% boom and Ford's (F) 136% surge, but "" the completion of new factories in Texas and Germany sets the stage for further growth in 2022 and beyond.""

The EV maker is increasingly popular in Europe, with Electrek reporting Norwegians have adopted its cars at a breathtaking pace. But China's vast market is where Tesla's present and future lie -- as does a potential stumbling block for its ambitions.

In a report published on Monday, The Wall Street Journal underscored how the company's opening of a new showroom in Xinjiang, a region at the center of genocide allegations against the Chinese government, militates against Musk's image as an iconoclastic rule breaker who frequently tangles with U.S. elected officials on Twitter.

The Xinjiang quandary is one Tesla also shares with a growing number of corporate American powerhouses like Nike (NKE), Walmart (WMT), Intel (INTC) -- and yes, Apple. The Morning Brief has previously covered the multitude of ways in which Beijing's domestic woes, and its unique brand of geopolitical hardball, have ensnared the Sino-American bilateral relationship in a thicket of recriminations and tensions.

While China is a huge part of Tesla's success, it also has the potential to inflict reputational damage on its brand as international furor toward Beijing grows more acute.

It also exposes the growing contradiction of American companies forced into a game of ""go along to get along"" with the Chinese government, even as they take increasingly polarizing social stances at home -- while paying virtually no political penalty for doing so.

As the iPhone maker set its intraday high-water mark, buzz surrounding the electric vehicle maker's blockbuster fourth quarter deliveries hit a crescendo -- with the stock seeing its best day in nearly a year. Effusive praise from Wall Street included the estimable Dan Ives, who called it a ""trophy case quarter,"" and predicted Tesla could see a $2 trillion market cap in less than two years, Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre reported.

The market's rapturous response to Tesla's big Q4 coinciding with Apple's big milestone is an irony best captured by Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management.

The investor was more complementary of Tesla's software capabilities than its car manufacturing, something that came under scrutiny last week after it issued a massive recall of nearly half a million vehicles. It also underscored how two of the biggest names in technology remain intertwined years after Apple reportedly approached Tesla about a potential merger, which Elon Musk summarily denied.

""Tesla is a better AI technology company than a car company, as we've all learned over the last 10 years,"" Gerber told Yahoo Finance Live last week, adding that the EV maker ""will be the most consequential company in the history of business"" within the next decade.

""They build cars, but they're basically building an iPhone on wheels. And so the entire infrastructure that they've been building around service, for example, has been a big challenge for them. They've innovated some amazing things like mobile service.""

As automakers and tech companies work to change how we get around, there are plenty of promises - and plenty of setbacks.

Here's a look at how far we've come - and how far we have to go - in 2021.

In May, a Waymo self-driving taxi got confused by traffic cones and blocked a road in Arizona. There have been other reports of odd behaviour during the ongoing pilot in some Phoenix neighbourhoods.

In October, Tesla started beta testing its $10,600 ""full self-driving capability"" with about 12,000 drivers. Despite the name, it's not actually self-driving - the driver needs to pay attention constantly - and testers have reported issues including running a red light and nearly striking a pedestrian.

While we may eventually see robot taxis in more cities, it'll still likely be decades before we see cars that can drive themselves anywhere while you sit in the front playing video games.

""I've been saying for the last five years that self-driving cars aren't likely to be here before, I would guess, 2050,"" Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicles for Consumer Reports, said earlier this year. ""Anyone that's telling you it's sooner than that is trying to sell you something, whether it's a product or a dream.""

Shared e-scooters have been growing in popularity in a few Canadian cities, scooter companies say.

Bird Canada - which has scooters in eight cities including Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa and Windsor - said about 200,000 riders took nearly 1.3 million trips in 2021. In 2019 and 2020 combined, there were about 500,000 trips.

""There are more than a dozen Canadian cities that are committed to launching e-scooter pilots in 2022, many of which are in Ontario,"" Bird Canada CEO Stewart Lyons said in an e-mail.

In May, Toronto voted against allowing them because they pose a ""safety hazard for all Toronto residents.""

From May 28 to August 24 in Calgary, for instance, at least 600 people ended up in the ER because of e-scooter crashes - that's about one crash for every 1,000 e-scooter rides in that city.

Companies say they're looking at solutions, including attached helmets.

While four more provinces made EVs cheaper for residents, one moved to make them more expensive.

It's a tax that will pay for road maintenance. The province hopes to collect about $60,000 a year.

BMW's Digital Key is evidence we'll soon be able to control many car features with just our voice

From a used-car price crash to Tesla video games, predictions and resolutions for 2022

The move comes as the federal government hopes for wider EV adoption.

In June, the federal government moved up its target for 100 per cent of new cars to be zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs) from 2040 to 2035.

But Ottawa hasn't imposed a national ZEV mandate that would require companies to sell a certain percentage of EVs.

Right now, the majority of EVs are sold in B.C. and Quebec, the only two provinces with ZEV mandates.

A national mandate ""would make sure every Canadian who wants an EV can find one to buy no matter where in the country they live,"" said Joanna Kyriazis, senior policy advisor with Clean Energy Canada, an environmental nonprofit.

Meanwhile, a proposed U.S. law that could potentially hurt Canada's auto industry has been stalled. The Build Back Better infrastructure bill would give carmakers a tax credit to build EVs in the U.S. The bill has been rejected by Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who is a Democrat and the deciding vote.

An EV with 830 kilometres of range can soon be yours for $189.000.

Lucid Motors, which opened its first Canadian store in Vancouver this fall, just started delivering its Air Grand Touring to U.S. customers. Deliveries are expected in Canada in 2022.

Other pricey EVs boast big range. For instance, you can get 652 kilometres in the $114,000 Tesla Model S Plaid.

But more reasonably priced EVs now offer at least 400 kilometres of range. This fall, Volkswagen started delivering its ID.4 all-electric SUV, which has a 400 kilometres range on its $44,995 rear-wheel drive version.

So, for mainstream buyers, how much range will be enough?

""For mainstream vehicles, we'll probably see things settle down into a range of about 250 to 300 miles [400 to 480 kilometres],"" said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst, transportation and energy, with Consumer Reports.

While advances in battery technology - including solid-state batteries being worked on by Toyota and other companies - have the potential to deliver even greater range, we're not there yet, Harto said.","{'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}",[],https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/eOtOjO4Vz7cmXIre2wCh4Bg7VCc=/560x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tgam/K44XHBLWUNJUXMUN3LJM2OBZ7Q.JPG,0.01960784313725483,,False,0,0.01960784313725483,378988560,1

Whether companies can deliver is another question.

We'll get our first clues at this week's CES electronics show in Las Vegas. That is, unless the high transmissibility of the omicron variant of the coronavirus makes a massive in-person gathering completely impossible. Big-name attendees including Intel, Meta and Amazon have already pulled out.

Some of the developments we'll discuss are long overdue. Some build on progress or change we saw in 2021.

In many ways, 2022 will be a year of ""hurry up and wait,"" Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst with research firm Creative Strategies, told us. Big-tech developments such as ""the metaverse,"" autonomous vehicles and greater repairability will take time to catch up to their hype, and companies must be careful not to overpromise, Milanesi said.

At the same time, companies need our buy-in more than ever. Smart-home technology, health wearables, and virtual reality all depend on our personal data to improve.

Here's what we expect -- and in some cases, hope -- to see in 2022.

Facebook parent company Meta may have generated the most buzz with its foray into the metaverse -- a theoretical shared space where people can hang out in virtual reality -- but the other tech giants won't be far behind.

2022 will be a ""race into the metaverse"" as large tech companies wrestle for slices of an emerging market, said Rolf Illenberger, CEO of virtual reality software maker VRdirect. Google, Microsoft and Apple may introduce their own headsets and operating systems for the metaverse, like their equivalents for PCs and smartphones.

The giants aren't alone, either: In recent years, parts of the CES floor have become a playground for start-ups building augmented and virtual reality headsets, and many are eager to make their mark on the metaverse. Meanwhile, there's another hurdle the industry will need to clear. Companies developing software that runs in the metaverse would have to make sure those programs play nicely with different operating systems.

As for the rest of us, our first steps into the metaverse will probably be for our jobs. The pandemic is pushing companies toward virtual reality for onboarding, training and meetings.

If you walk into a big-box retailer or hardware store, it probably wouldn't take you long to find smart-home goodies such as connected lightbulbs and thermostats. What can take awhile is finding stuff that works with the products you already have -- but that might not be the case for much longer.

Some of the biggest names in Big Tech, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung, have teamed up to develop a new smart-home standard called Matter. The aim: to ensure that the home gadgets you buy in the future all play nice with one another, regardless of who made them or what virtual assistant you want to use when interacting with them.

""Today, when you look at a smart-home-connected device, you have to look at what ecosystem it works with,"" said Erik Kay, a vice president of engineering at Google. ""Where we're going with Matter is that you don't have to think about any of that.""

This year, electric vehicles will transition from cutting edge to standard issue -- if you live somewhere with the infrastructure to support EV charging.

Electric models from household names including Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen will make EVs accessible to more people at lower prices. Market leader Tesla will continue expanding, and such start-ups as Lucid and Rivian will elbow their way into the fray.

And shoppers will be able to choose from electric vehicles beyond the traditional sedan, with Volkswagen expanding the availability of its family-size ID.4 and Ford introducing an electric F-150 truck. Tesla's divisive Cybertruck could even hit the market in 2022. But one thing could delay these mainstream moves.

A prolonged chip shortage has upended the way automakers churn out new vehicles, driven up prices of televisions, and made hot products such as Sony's PlayStation 5 nearly impossible to buy.

The effects of the shortage probably won't start to fade until the back half of 2022, said Syed Alam, managing director at Accenture Strategy. And that's the best-case scenario.

Sudden changes -- like, say, the emergence of a new variant -- could throw a wrench into recovery plans.

In the meantime, Intel, Samsung and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have announced plans to build chip plants in the United States, and they should help protect these companies -- plus others that rely on them -- from wild swings in chip availability. The problem is, these kinds of facilities take years to go live, so it's unlikely they'll be able to make a dent in the situation anytime soon.

Phones, laptops, tablets -- we rely on gadgets like these every day, but companies haven't exactly made them easy to fix when things go wrong. Slowly but surely, it seems that might be starting to change.

Apple, which for years maintained strict control over how its products could be fixed, will roll out a self-service repair program in early 2022. The move will allow enthusiastic amateurs to access the parts and guides to fix their iPhones and Mac computers.

Apple isn't alone. In October -- shortly after it unveiled a flashy, hard-to-upgrade Surface laptop -- Microsoft announced plans to increase the options that consumers have to repair their devices by the end of 2022. Meanwhile, Dell is experimenting with ""circular"" design, starting with a concept it calls Luna. It might look like a regular laptop, but fewer internal screws and a rejiggered design make it easier to pull apart and fix or upgrade than some other PCs.

Clinicians are already starting to use individual biometric data -- data from our bodies -- to prevent, diagnose and treat health problems. With more health wearables measuring our hearts, lungs, sleep, steps, calories and even sweat, we'll start doing the same at home. In 2022, you may use a ring on your finger to see how regular cardio exercise affects your sleep, or a bracelet to monitor your blood pressure.

Health wearables also generate huge amounts of personal medical data that's not protected by existing medical privacy laws such as HIPAA, so it's hard to know for sure where all that data will end up. There are also big hurdles when it comes to sharing that data with our health-care providers in ways they can easily parse.

Customers have good reason to be skeptical. In 2021, security breaches, data privacy problems, and AI whistleblowers dominated technology news.

In 2022, companies will try to regain lost trust with a variety of tactics, such as creating high-ranking roles in charge of ""digital trust,"" offering cash rewards to people who identify bias in AI systems, and adopting technologies that partially anonymize personal data, Forrester research predicts.

Companies will get hungrier for ""first-party"" data -- data we share with them directly. The more we trust companies to handle our personal data and shape our experiences with algorithms, the more they can monetize that trust through ""personalized"" experiences and advertisements.

The book was penned by the award-winning author of the Booker-prize finalist We Need New Names, NoViolet Bulawayo, and is inspired by the fall of Mugabe as president in November 2017 after nearly 40 years in office.

According to the publisher, Penguin Random House, is a ""blockbuster of a novel that chronicles the fall of an oppressive regime, and the chaotic, kinetic potential for real liberation that rises in its wake.""

Glory centres around the unexpected fall of Old Horse, a long-serving leader of a fictional country, and the drama that follows for a disorderly nation of animals on the path to true liberation.

""Inspired by the unexpected fall by coup, in November 2017, of Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president of nearly four decades, Bulawayo's bold, vividly imagined novel shows a country imploding, narrated by a chorus of animal voices who unveil the ruthlessness and cold strategy required to uphold the illusion of absolute power, and the imagination and bullet-proof optimism to overthrow it completely.

As with her debut novel, We Need New Names, Bulawayo's fierce voice and lucid imagery immerses readers in the daily life of a traumatised nation, revealing the dazzling life force and irrepressible wit that lies barely concealed beneath the surface of seemingly bleak circumstances.

""At the centre of this tumult is Destiny, who has returned to Jidada from exile to bear witness to revolution-and focus on the unofficial history and the potential legacy of the women who have quietly pulled the strings in this country.

""The animal kingdom-its connection to our primal responses and resonance in the mythology, folktales, and fairy tales that define cultures the world over-unmasks the surreality of contemporary global politics to help us understand our world more clearly, even as Bulawayo plucks us right out of it.

""Glory is a blockbuster, an exhilarating ride, and crystalises a turning point in history with the texture and nuance that only the greatest of fiction can.""

A US-based news publication, Boston said Glory was among 23 books, avid readers should look forward to reading this year.

""This novel is another to add to the list in 2022. The story, inspired by the 2017 fall of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, is about the demise of an oppressive regime and the chaos of revolution, presented in an 'uncannily recognizable anthropomorphic allegory,'"" Boston said.

""In her bold, vividly imagined novel, animal voices call out the dangerous absurdity of contemporary global politics. So it's a totally original rendering of the illusory and transient character of power.""

NoViolet Bulawayo is the pen name of Elizabeth Zandile Tshele, a Zimbabwean author and Stegner Fellow at Stanford University in the US.","{'uri': 'allafrica.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'allAfrica'}",[],https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,0.3411764705882352,,True,0,0.3411764705882352,378987300,1

But Mercedes did not simply give the EQXX a gigantic battery pack and name it a day. It says it is engineered the EQXX to ship extra vary utilizing much less power.

Mercedes gave the EQXX a teardrop form that lets it slip by the air even higher than the EQS, the corporate's electric flagship. Mercedes says the EQXX is extra aerodynamic than a soccer.

The EQXX additionally will get particular tires that lower down on rolling resistance ...

... and light-weight magnesium wheels.

The firm additionally developed a new battery pack and drivetrain to optimize effectivity.

Since the EQXX is geared extra towards lengthy street journeys than observe days, it makes comparatively little energy -- simply 200 horses.

Solar panels built-in into the EQXX's roof can add as much as 25 kilometers (about 15 miles) of vary underneath perfect climate circumstances, Mercedes says.

It would not be a Benz if it did not have a luxurious cabin.

But the EQXX's inside, identical to the remainder of the car, is all about effectivity.

Mercedes stuffed the cabin with sustainable supplies that it says decrease the car's general carbon footprint.

The door pulls are made out of a vegan silk-like materials, the corporate says.

The EQXX additionally sports activities vegan leathers made out of mushrooms and cacti, in keeping with Mercedes.

Some surfaces are made out of recycled plastic bottles.

The Vision EQXX additionally gives a sneak peek at the way forward for Mercedes' in-car screens. The idea has a single huge show that stretches 47.5 inches throughout the dashboard.

Essayed in a lucid, snackable format, this #HowTo series acts as a tutorial, bringing in the most relevant voices on a subject, so that you benefit the most in your business or career. In the article below, we examine the advantages of having the right cofounder and why some prefer not to have a cofounder. You can read the previous article here.

Are you the marrying type or do you prefer to remain single? Running your startup poses a similar question. Do you onboard a cofounder or should you go solo?

Launching a startup and running it is a hard job. It requires the tenacity of the highest order. A funded startup brings with it added pressures and sometimes you need a fellow traveller to share the highs and lows of the journey. But, yet some prefer to be the sole founder, to be in control, and are not much into consulting or collaborating.

So, there is no right or wrong answer here. It's a choice you make. By and large, startups have two founders. In some cases, there are three but it's never advisable to have more than four.

One obvious advantage of having a cofounder, as opposed to a senior management person, is that the co-founder is equally vested in the company as you.

You have someone to share critical issues with, which you can't with an employee. Doesn't matter how passionate you are about the startup, there are bound to be days when the founder feels dejected. That's when a co-founder lends a steadying hand.

""Deciding to have a co-founder or not will depend largely on one's personality type,"" says Shanti Mohan, founder-CEO, LetsVenture, which helps startups raise funds. Depending on the outcome, building a founding team can either be a deal-breaker or a game-changer.

Why a co-founder?

The first thing is to figure why you are onboarding a co-founder? Is it because you are friends or are the reasons professional? Does the co-founder enjoy a vast network of connections or is the person a tech geek who can resolve a hard problem? Is the co-founder a marketing whiz or financially adept? You need affirmative answers for some of these questions before going ahead.Kris Gopalakrishnan, a co-founder of IT behemoth Infosys, says it is better to have co-founders who have similar values, goals and time horizons for achieving their goals. ""Alignment is important,"" says Gopalakrishnan who is now an investor. ""Skills and capabilities, ideally, should be complementary. This is important since it is difficult to find one person having all these,"" he says.

It is good to have founders who drive each other and can stand in when one needs to take a break. ""Investors prefer to have two-three co-founders so that all their eggs are not in one basket and the 'key person' risk is reduced. It is also important that the families connect and are comfortable with each other. Otherwise, the families can pull the founder alignment apart,"" says Gopalakrishnan.

He, along with NR Narayanamurthy, Nandan Nilekani, SD Shibulal and others, built Infosys into one of the world's leading IT services companies because they had a shared vision. They also got along with each other.

""A great founding team is the one that is more than the sum of its parts,"" says Smriti Tomar, founder-CEO of fintech start-up Stack Finance.

""It's no surprise that a number of the original founding team members leave in the first two years. This can bring down the morale of the team and also affect the image of the start-up in the eyes of the investors,"" says Tomar.

Some of the founders prefer not to have a cofounder because as more investors come into the picture, there will be considerable equity dilution.

Yet, most of them prefer having a good cofounder along with a dedicated founding team. The energy within the team is almost as important as the quality of the product being built. Often, founder fatigue can lead to a company closing down.

""A company run by a single founder can reach its fatigue faster,"" Mohan of LetsVenture says. But multiple founders can lead to conflicts as well. ""Hence, conflict resolution is critical. Just like in any relationship, one has to sit down and talk, and not wish it will go away. The earlier you do it the better,"" says Mohan.

Whoever the cofounders may be, they all should align on core values and a common mission. If that isn't the case, then having varied skills will not help.That does not mean they can't have opposing views, which can be settled through a discussion. That's why many startups have two co-founders. But having too many can delay decision-making. ""It's important to appoint one of the co-founders as CEO, who will be the face of the company. The CEO will be the final decision-maker,"" she says.

Have a board, document and be clear on equity split

Having a board is a good idea, even when the company hasn't raised any funding. ""It's all about governance; there's nothing emotional about it. For the company to be professionally run, documentation is needed, like a founders' agreement,"" says Mohan.

Multiple co-founders can lead to a dispute over the equity split. Often, the split is unequal. In some cases, it can be extremely unequal, possibly because one founder claims credit for the startup idea and wants greater equity or someone is more experienced and was drawing a higher salary in the corporate world. Sometimes the equity is split unequally because one co-founder takes salary for a year and the other cofounder doesn't or simply because a cofounder onboarded the startup earlier.

But do these things matter? Most startups need five-eight years to be successful (not just become a unicorn). Finally, it's about which cofounder can make it work.

The reality is that the lesser the equity disparity, the better it is for the company. What's the point in having the lion's share of the equity if the company is doomed. Why would investors trust a cofounder-CEO who keeps the majority of the equity even when they have equally talented co-founders? You want all the founders to be equally committed and motivated.

But yet, it is important to realise that all fingers are not equal. ""There are founders who can do 0-1 but cannot do 1-n,"" says LetsVenture's Shanti Mohan. ""I feel I'm a very good 0-1 person who can ideate, bring it off the ground but after that I need to bring in someone who can scale the business.""One has to be equally proficient in hiring the rest of the founding team too. It's important to weigh the attitude of the founding team as much as their skills, says Tomar of Stack Finance. ""You need to look for what is called the 'founder's mindset'. That basically means the person should be passionate, resilient, self-motivated and not risk-averse. See if the person is willing to take a lesser salary and take more shares/ESOP in the company,"" says the 25-year-old founder.

Co-founders should have varied skills but common objectives

If one founder is quiet, the other co-founder should be a networker who can strike good conversations with investors and customers. If one is temperamental and bound to lose cool, you need a more placid cofounder to balance it.

Similar expectations regarding work-life balance will help. Mismatch in the number of hours put in or having completely different objectives in personal lives can wreak havoc during initial years. That's why it's great to have someone who has worked with you as a cofounder.

""Knowing the working patterns of the cofounder is an advantage. One should know the deal-breakers,"" says Mohan. ""For example, I would like to spend time with my family after 8 pm. The co-founder should know that. You can't take what is important to your company and align it back to your life. You have to take what is important to you and then align it back to the company -- otherwise, you get an unhappy individual,"" she says.The fact that you will likely spend more time with your co-founder than with your spouse, it is extremely important that the founders relate to each other's personalities. If you can't get along, then it doesn't matter what other skills the cofounder possesses.","{'uri': 'moneycontrol.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MoneyControl'}",[],https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/04/mc-minis-investment-in-startup.jpg,0.05882352941176472,,False,0,0.05882352941176472,378978900,1

And it's the range of Mercedes' new concept EV that is the real headline-grabbing stat, with the German manufacturer claiming the Vision EQXX can travel over 1,000km (over 620 miles) on a single charge - a market leading figure.

To give you an idea of the distance you could theoretically drive on a single charge of the EQXX, the range is equivalent to a trip from Berlin to Paris, from New York City to Cincinnati, Ohio, or from Beijing to Nanjing.

Mercedes claims, based on average distances driven per year, Vision EQXX drivers in the US and China would - on average - only have to recharge twice a month, while European drivers would typically only have to recharge once a month.

What's more, the firm says it has squeezed the energy of its flagship Mercedes-Benz EQS into the dimensions of a compact car, with this technological breakthrough aided by the firm's Formula 1 know-how.

As this is a concept, the EV won't actually go on sale, but Mercedes says it's very close to a production car, with a number of technologies featured here set to make their way into an electric car from the brand in 2024 or 2025.

During an exclusive press briefing with Daimler AG's Chief Technology Officer for the Vision EQXX, Markus Schafer said a ""number of elements of the car are close to moving into [a] production [vehicle]. We're very close to a serious car we'll see in 2024.""

That includes its new battery technology with offers up the car's massive range, as well as the upgraded MBUX operating system splashed across the mammoth display inside the car.

Mercedes is keen to make its electric cars as efficient as possible, as Schafer explains. ""We think range matters for our customers, and efficiency matters. This program is all about efficiency and reducing electrical consumption.

""We want to have the lowest possible consumption"", and the Vision EQXX certainly showcases that desire.

Battery chemists at Mercedes have managed to produce a battery with a capacity of 100kW in a package that is 50% smaller and 30% lighter than the comparable battery in the EQS.

What this means is EV development is moving rapidly, and smaller electric vehicles now have the opportunity to benefit from increased range - something that has mainly been reserved for larger vehicles, until now.

Another aspect that helps the Vision EQXX gain so much range is its aerodynamics. The EQS holds the world record as the first production car in the world with a Cd value of 0.20 (beating out the Lucid Air with its 0.21 score), but the EQXX bests that value, with a drag coefficient rating of Cd 0.17.

There's even a 'lightweight F1 subframe' at play here, which Mercedes says ""brings racing efficiency to the road."" That should translate to some pretty impressive acceleration and top speed stats, although Mercedes has yet to reveal what these are.

The Vision EQXX also features a retractable rear diffuser that deploys at high speeds, and 20-inch, forged-magnesium wheels.

All of this helps the Vision EQXX achieve its market-leading 1,000km (around 620 miles) range on a single charge, and it also supports fast charging that can see 300km (roughly 186 miles) replenished in 15 minutes.

We've seen a number of electric car manufacturers dabble with solar panels on their vehicles already, and the Vision EQXX joins the crowd with 117 solar cells on its roof.

Unlike other EV solar-panel-systems however, the setup on the EQXX could be far more useful, with Mercedes claiming that the ultra-thin roof panels ""can add up to 25km (around 15 miles) of range on long-distance journeys in a day.""

Now, that is the absolute best-case scenario in ""ideal conditions"", but it's significantly better than Hyundai's quoted 5-6 miles per day on the solar-panel clad Ioniq 5.

Energy gained via the solar cells is stored in a separate battery, which is used to power the climate blower, lights, infotainment system and other ancillaries - leaving more juice in the main battery for actual driving.

And this technology isn't just reserved for the Vision EQXX concept, with Schafer confirming that it will feature ""in future vehicles"".

Inside the Vision EQXX you'll find a range of sustainable materials, from a verified vegan leather alternative made from mycelium in the detail of the seat cushions to high-strength, biotechnology-based and certified-vegan silk-like fabric used for the door pulls.

Meanwhile, the carpets are made from 100% bamboo fiber, and recycled PET bottles feature in the cabin materials.

What dominates the interior however, is the screen Mercedes uses. This is the first time the firm is offering a completely seamless display in a car - the 'Hyperscreen' in the EQS is actually three separate displays in one curved glass unit.

The Vision EQXX one-ups Hyperscreen with its own 47.5-inch mini-LED display, which stretches from pillar to pillar, across the entire dash, and features an eye-popping 8K resolution.

On-screen you'll find a real-time 3D navigation system, an enhanced 'Hey Mercedes' voice assistant and even an efficiency assistant to help you get the most range from your charge.

As we've already said, the Mercedes Vision EQXX is a concept electric car, so it's never going to hit the market.

However, the advancements made here will translate to future Mercedes EVs - be it extended range, better battery efficiency, the introduction of more solar panels or just massive screens. There's plenty to get excited about.","{'uri': 'ghanaiantimes.com.gh', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Ghanaian Times'}",[],https://www.ghanaiantimes.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HzLkXymt3SavAVGiFW6HJG-970-80.jpg.webp,,,True,0,,378977400,1

The book was penned by the award-winning author of the Booker-prize finalist We Need New Names, NoViolet Bulawayo, and is inspired by the fall of Mugabe as president in November 2017 after nearly 40 years in office.

According to the publisher, Penguin Random House, is a ""blockbuster of a novel that chronicles the fall of an oppressive regime, and the chaotic, kinetic potential for real liberation that rises in its wake.""

Glory centres around the unexpected fall of Old Horse, a long-serving leader of a fictional country, and the drama that follows for a disorderly nation of animals on the path to true liberation.

""Inspired by the unexpected fall by coup, in November 2017, of Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president of nearly four decades, Bulawayo's bold, vividly imagined novel shows a country imploding, narrated by a chorus of animal voices who unveil the ruthlessness and cold strategy required to uphold the illusion of absolute power, and the imagination and bullet-proof optimism to overthrow it completely.

As with her debut novel, We Need New Names, Bulawayo's fierce voice and lucid imagery immerses readers in the daily life of a traumatised nation, revealing the dazzling life force and irrepressible wit that lies barely concealed beneath the surface of seemingly bleak circumstances.

""At the centre of this tumult is Destiny, who has returned to Jidada from exile to bear witness to revolution-and focus on the unofficial history and the potential legacy of the women who have quietly pulled the strings in this country.

""The animal kingdom-its connection to our primal responses and resonance in the mythology, folktales, and fairy tales that define cultures the world over-unmasks the surreality of contemporary global politics to help us understand our world more clearly, even as Bulawayo plucks us right out of it.

""Glory is a blockbuster, an exhilarating ride, and crystalises a turning point in history with the texture and nuance that only the greatest of fiction can.""

A US-based news publication, Boston said Glory was among 23 books, avid readers should look forward to reading this year.

""This novel is another to add to the list in 2022. The story, inspired by the 2017 fall of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, is about the demise of an oppressive regime and the chaos of revolution, presented in an 'uncannily recognizable anthropomorphic allegory,'"" Boston said.

""In her bold, vividly imagined novel, animal voices call out the dangerous absurdity of contemporary global politics. So it's a totally original rendering of the illusory and transient character of power.""

As the electric era continues to grow, Mercedes-Benz is proving to be determined to lead the way.

The unveiling of Mercedes' concept EV claims that the EQXX boasts a 620-mile range before recharging. Should the EQXX become a reality, it has the potential to beat competitors including the Lucid Air Dream Edition by over 100 miles and even the Tesla Model S Long Range Plus by approximately 220 miles. Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz AG, Ola Källenius spoke on the mission for creating the concept vehicle, ""We will build the world's most desirable electric cars.""

The EQXX is expected to be designed for road trips, answering the progressive demands of the current generation of modern customers. As a result of its latest digital innovation, the EQXX has the agility of a start-up and the speed of a Formula 1 racer. According to the simulations, the Vision EQXX would require less than 10 kWh to travel 62 miles on public roads and is expected to deliver an efficiency of more than 6 miles per kWh. In comparison tp the EQS, the EQXX's battery is also half the size and therefore, 30% lighter. The solar panels on the roof would give the EQXX additional 15.5 miles of range, adding to the aerodynamic optimization of the car.

The Vision EQXX is considered to be a lightweight car at 3,858 lbs and a drag coefficient of cd 0.17 making it more aerodynamic than a football. Mercedes has also claimed that 95% of the battery energy will be directed towards the wheels of the vehicle. The interior of the EQXX is also impressive and features a single 47.5-inch, mini-LED 8K screen. Similar to the Hyperscreen in the EQS, it spans across the entire width of the front dashboard as a one-piece display. Mercedes-Benz AG, Chief Technology Officer responsible for Development and Procurement said,

""As a halo car, the VISION EQXX firmly establishes Mercedes-Benz as the brand that pairs luxury with technology in the automotive world and beyond. And the way we developed it is as revolutionary as the vehicle itself. VISION EQXX has seen the best minds from our R&D centers work together with engineers from our Formula 1 and Formula E programs. They are proving that innovations from motorsport - where powertrains are already highly electrified - have immediate relevance for road car development. We are challenging current development processes with innovative spirit and outside-the-box thinking. This truly is the way forward.""

Chances are there's a video that explains what to do."" My boys were right about that one. No matter what the task at hand is, it's helpful to have the right tools.

Meteorologist rely on weather models, but the trick is finding the right blend of model solutions for the most accuracy and highest confidence. Personally, I look at as many models as possible, but when push comes to shove the weather tool I rely on the most is ECMWF (European model). It's not perfect, but previous studies have shown it is consistently more accurate. NOAA's GFS model has improved over time, but it's still playing catch-up.

Enjoy today's thaw, because 1-3"" of snow tomorrow marks the leading edge of more subzero fun. The mercury stays below zero Thursday, with a wind chill of -25F in the metro. I see another quick subzero pop next Monday, then hints of moderation as waves of Pacific air push inland.

Only in Minnesota could an extended outlook of 20s and 30s (above zero) be greeted with breathless celebratory anticipation.

Couple of Inches Wednesday. ECMWF and NOAA models predict 1-3"" Wednesday with more well north of MSP. Conditions may be ripe for blowing and drifting in open areas as winds gust to 30 mph, pulling in the next shot of subzero air.

Another Arctic Occupation. This one won't last long either, but temperatures remain well below zero Thursday and the first half of Friday before some recovery by Saturday. All this bitter air is pushing the main storm track well south of Minnesota, at least through the first half of next week.

Very Cold GFS Solution. Let's see if this is a fluke or a real trend, but if the guidance above verifies our subzero interludes may continue well into January. Not convinced just yet.

Historic US Weather Events in 2021, by the Numbers. Capital Weather Gang examines the biggest extreme-weather stories of last year: ""From record-shattering heat to frigid waves of cold, torrential downpours to relentless drought, 2021 has been a year of extremes in the United States. As personal stories and images illuminate the devastation wrought by the events, the raw numbers also underline the widespread impacts and extraordinary nature of this year's weather...The United States experienced 18 billion-dollar weather disasters in the first nine months of 2021, totaling more than $104 billion.

We Can Build Homes to Survive Tornadoes. We Just Haven't. An Op-Ed at The Washington Post (paywall) caught my eye; here's a clip: ""...No one believes all tornado damage can be avoided. But most tornadoes -- more than 95 percent -- have ground-level wind speeds of 135 miles per hour or less. Researchers from Texas Tech University who conducted the post-tornado surveys in Lubbock stated that while best estimates suggested maximum wind speeds at ground level were 200 miles per hour, most of the damage was caused by winds in the range of 75 to 125 miles per hour. With better building construction, we can narrow the width of the most catastrophic destruction -- the distance away from the tornado's centerline -- so that homes, while possibly experiencing damage, remain occupiable immediately after a tornado. For a house to withstand wind loads, which pull up against the building's structure and away from the ground against gravity, they must have strong, continuous lines of mechanical connections that tie every component, from the roof through the walls, down to the foundation...""

The Causal Effect of Environmental Catastrophe on Long-Run Economic Growth from 6,700 Cyclones. A new paper at NBER highlights the ""long-tail"" effect of tropical cyclones on local economies; here's an excerpt of the summary: ""... Income losses arise from a small but persistent suppression of annual growth rates spread across the fifteen years following disaster, generating large and significant cumulative effects: a 90th percentile event reduces per capita incomes by 7.4% two decades later, effectively undoing 3.7 years of average development. The gradual nature of these losses render them inconspicuous to a casual observer, however simulations indicate that they have dramatic influence over the long-run development of countries that are endowed with regular or continuous exposure to disaster. Linking these results to projections of future cyclone activity, we estimate that under conservative discounting assumptions the present discounted cost of ""business as usual"" climate change is roughly $9.7 trillion larger than previously thought...""

How to Prepare for Power Outages. A post at WIRED.com (paywall) has some good advice; here's a clip: ""...The worst part of an outage is when night falls, and in the winter months that can come early in the evening. Without power your place is enveloped in darkness, and basic tasks like just walking to the kitchen can result in slips, bumps, and unnecessary injury in general. The first thing I keep on hand -- in strategic places around the house -- are LED lanterns. They're low-cost, use very little power, and can go for months without having to replace the batteries. Keep one near a stairwell or on the kitchen counter so you can navigate your now-enshrouded home safely. And if you need to go somewhere else in the house? They're portable. While being able to traverse your own place safely is important, the secondary effect is eliminating the need for the flashlight app on your phone, which is usually a battery vampire...""

Especially so in Nigeria where the average life expectancy is 54.69.

Any man who has spent 80 long years on earth in good health would, ought to acknowledge longevity as God's gift. Especially so in Nigeria where the average life expectancy is 54.69.

Achieving the 80-year milestone is not by hard work. It is not because one had lived by the rules - nutrition rules, health rules, spiritual rules. Or engaged the best doctors. Employed the best nutritionists. Walked gingerly through good and bad roads.

A long life as we now understand it is not by mathematical calculations. It is often outside the control of man. So, when a highly visible and iconic public figure as Professor Bolaji Akinyemi turns 80 on January 4, 2022, we must roll out the flowers and drums with great panache in thanksgiving to God.

As a man of faith, son of a cleric, my big mentor and public service model, Professor Akinyemi acknowledges the grace of God in his life! His signature cute and ubiquitous bow tie, which became the acme of the sartorial elegance of the iconic Professor Bolaji Akinwande Akinyemi as a public official in the 1970s has remained etched in our memory and consciousness some 35 odd years after he left formal public office. It is true that he has quit public office, first as Director-General Nigeria Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) under the Murtala/Obasanjo military administration and later as Minister of External Affairs under the Ibrahim Babangida administration. Yet, this eclectic public intellectual in the Henry Kissinger tradition has not quit the public space thanks to a very active media presence.

He is an interviewer's delight, often displaying a profound and historical socio-scientific understanding of contemporary national and international political and social issues.

Yet, to reduce our remembrance of Akinyemi to sartorial matters reduces, indeed profanes the gamut of intellectual contributions of this public intellectual to the development of policy framework in Nigeria. As a man who bubbled and still bubbles with big ideas on national development, foreign policy, interethnic relations, international relations, electoral reforms, and national security, Akinyemi straddles decades of public service. In all of this, Akinyemi comes forth as a man who spoke truth before its time! What else can we say of a man who in 1987 proposed the need for the 'black bomb? Or a man who had the temerity to suggest the Technical Aid Corps idea to a military government and had the energy and gusto to see it implemented?

In the heady days of the military in government in Nigeria, one institution that stood out both in quality of activities and presence in the media was the Nigeria Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) where Akinyemi directed affairs from 1975 till 1983. He worked with military Head of State late General Murtala Mohammed whom he had access to on policy formulation and implementation. No one familiar with Nigeria's foreign policy at the time in question would forget Murtala's 'African has Come of Age' speech and the tough stance Nigeria took on South Africa and the liberation movement in southern Africa.

The seminars, lectures, and conferences organised by NIIA were a regular in the academic space of Nigeria, a veritable town and academia dialogue. All events were highly visible, what with the presence of who-is-who in government at the time, from both the executive and judicial arms of government. Generals, other army officers and public intellectuals made the NIIA a regular in the calendar of social engagements. Visiting Heads of State and Prime Ministers inevitably stopped by at the NIIA for public lectures. It was during the years when public officials dared to engage in academic discourse, entertaining a variety of ideas and strategies. Whatever happened to that culture? The fecund mind and energetic man behind the foremost position of NIIA were the then Dr. Bolaji Akinyemi, a returnee from American and British universities located at the University of Ibadan. How was he able to pull such quality crowds to the lecture hall of the NIIA? That that institute has become a shell speaks volumes of the man Akinyemi.

At the Ministry of External Affairs where he held sway from 1985 to 1987, Akinyemi brought a high quality of thinking into diplomacy. It was during this period that he showed the charisma of a Kissinger in diplomatic and foreign affairs, attending and representing Nigeria in different international events. We had referred to the Technical Aid Corps (TAC) scheme which saw Nigeria exporting manpower to less fortunate countries. The purpose of the scheme was 'to promote the country's image and status as a major contributor to Third World and particularly African development'. Professionals such as medical doctors, engineers and teachers served in the programme and projected the image of Nigeria as a medium power in world affairs. He developed a principled framework that underpinned the trajectory of foreign policy at this time - the 'Concert of Medium Powers'. It was dramatic to name his call for Nigeria to develop nuclear technology the 'Black bomb', with all the innuendos on the word 'black'. Yet it resonated across the country and some 35 years after, we still pine over lack of energy generation and supply!

Outside government, Akinyemi forayed into national activism under the aegis of NADECO when the time came to challenge the fatal impunity of Maximum Ruler General Sanni Abacha. Sacrificing his comfort and safety he went on exile through the popular 'NADECO route', with all its hazards. The thrilling drama of a sudden exit from Lagos in full disguise, facilitated by coded actions and words and a small chain of helpers, to escape the murder squad of the Abacha days is a story for another day, forthcoming in his biography. The academic became a hero in the fight for democracy. And when he returned to Nigeria after the restoration of democracy, the Yar'Adua and Jonathan governments respectively appointed him to serve the nation in committee work - the Electoral Reform Panel, Committee on Boko Haram, and the 2014 National Confab in which he functioned as Deputy Chairman. He still gives lectures on policymaking and implementation though, in 1983, he gave a highly cerebral lecture on 'A Farewell to Policy'!

Professor Bolaji still carries the smile of youth in his old age, with the infinite capacity to laugh robustly when the need arises, with the appropriate anecdotes and jokes. I admire his ability to take on serious issues of national and international importance with remarkable aplomb and consummate dexterity, practically thinking on his feet. He still maintains the poise of yore, with the well-maintained afro-hair style. An ardent believer in the corporate existence of a restructured Nigeria, Professor Akinyemi does not look 80, does not walk 80, does not work 80, does not think 80, and certainly does not think 80! His thoughts are lucid, his speech pattern measured as a statesman, sure and certain; and his power of recollection almost as sharp as it was 30 years ago! What else does one ask of God at Age 80?

In concluding this tribute at 80 to a distinguished scholar, father, and grandfather, academic, public intellectual, mentor, foreign policy adviser, a team player in committee work, social-cum political activist and foremost visionary in the corridors of power I dare say that Akinyemi is a man who spoke truth before its time. At 80, it may not be creation morning; still, it is not an exit time for a man whose training in Igbobi College, Christ School Ado Ekiti, Temple University Philadelphia, Tufts University Massachusetts, and Trinity College Oxford prepared him for the world of ideas and service to humanity! And as we used to say at The Guardian Editorial Board, being 80 has implications!","{'uri': 'guardian.ng', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Bolaji-Akinyemi-640x360.jpg,0.2784313725490195,eng-7382006,False,0.8117647171020508,0.2784313725490195,378961860,1

The strong fourth quarter of 308,600 vehicles gave Tesla full-year sales of 936,000, up 87 per cent from the 2020 total, and above the 900,000 mark that had been the target set by many analysts, according to CNN.

""Taking a step back, with the chip shortage a major overhang on the auto space and logistical issues globally these delivery numbers were jaw dropping,"" Dan Ives, analyst for Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients Sunday.

He said Wall Street forecasts of 265,000 Tesla sales in the fourth quarter would have taken full-year sales to 892,000. The 900,000 sales target that Tesla easily cleared was a ""best case number in the eyes of the street,"" according to Ives.

Other automakers are all expected to report reduced fourth-quarter sales when they release US numbers this coming week. Tesla reports only global sales, but industry-wide, global auto sales are expected to be broadly lower in the fourth quarter.

Cox Automotive is forecasting that overall US fourth quarter sales will be down 24 per cent due to the shortage of computer chips that caused plants to temporarily shut, limited the inventory of vehicles in dealerships and drove up car prices to record levels.

""The industry ran out of vehicles, and sales stalled in the second half,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, chief economist for Cox Automotive. ""Total sales in the second-half of 2021 were the slowest in a decade. Demand is healthy, but supply and production disruptions kept the industry in check. You can't sell what you don't have.""

Tesla had its own chip shortage issues during the year but was able to manage through them. The EV maker's achievement was more impressive considering that it is facing increased competition from traditional automakers now offering more electric vehicle models.

For example, the Ford Mustang Mach-E had US sales of nearly 25,000 vehicles through November in its first year on the market. Ford recently announced plans to triple production to meet demand. There are also new EV-only automakers now selling vehicles, including Lucid and Rivian, which both recently won MotorTrend's car and truck of the year honors.

So while Telsa's share of the EV market might be declining somewhat in the face of new competition, the demand for EVs is growing even faster, allowing Tesla to continue to report strong growth.

""While there are many competitors in the EV space, Tesla continues to dominate market share as evidenced again this quarter while battling through the chip shortage,"" Ives said.

Tesla has forecast that with new factories near Austin, Texas, and Berlin about to start full-scale production in 2022, it should have annual global sales growth of 50 per cent or better for at least the next few years.

Investors have rewarded Tesla, lifting its share price 52 per cent in 2021. While that's modest compared to the 743 per cent gain shares achieved in 2020, it was still better than most automakers, including most other EV-only companies. And it was enough to give Tesla a market value greater than the combined value of the 12 largest global automakers, and to make it only the sixth company ever to be worth more than $1tn.","{'uri': 'punchng.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Punch Newspapers'}",[],https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/17155511/punchlogo.png,0.003921568627450966,eng-7379376,False,0.7058823704719543,0.003921568627450966,378961740,1

Virtually none have succeeded.

Tesla is the rare exception, having taken advantage of the emerging interest in battery-electric vehicles. Its sales nearly doubled last year, to 960,172 vehicles. And with two more plants opening -- in Berlin and Austin, Texas -- it's expected to quickly blast through the 1 million mark this year. That's providing a note of hope for the dozen or more competitors hoping to match its success.

Long-skeptical investors have recently shown great readiness to embrace the most promising newcomers. But some are struggling for capital, and their vehicles may not make it into production, analysts warned.

""The potential some of these startups have is that they're breaking into a nascent EV market that has doubled in size this past year and is ready to take off,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, the principal auto analyst for Guidehouse Insight.

""There is suddenly a vibrant market that traditional manufacturers have been slow to tap into,"" Abuelsamid said, adding that ""the window of opportunity is a narrow one and closing fast,"" as companies like General Motors, Ford, Hyundai and Volkswagen prepare to unleash scores of new, long-range battery-electric vehicles of their own by mid-decade.

Here's a look at some of the strongest and weakest of the EV startups, as well as a few others yet to clearly show whether they can plug in and light up the market.

Rivian is arguably the strongest of all the new startups, most analysts agree. The company has piles of cash and the backing of early investors like Ford and Amazon. Amazon's Prime service has an outstanding order for 100,000 Rivian delivery trucks. And Rivian's R1T pickup -- which was named Motor Trend Truck of the Year -- is now on sale. Production hiccups worried investors, but it still has a market capitalization north of $90 billion, more than GM or Ford.

Lucid CEO and Chief Technology Officer Peter Rawlinson was the man who whipped the original Tesla Model S into shape -- and that helped him set new benchmarks for his startup's own Lucid Air sedan. Two versions of the initial launch edition are now on sale, one with 1,100 horsepower, the other delivering over 500 miles of range, an industry best. The price tag? An exotic $160,000. But Lucid has plans for a mix of more mainstream sedans and SUVs.

Fisker takes its name from Henrik Fisker, who won kudos as a designer for Aston Martin. He launched his first brand with the plug-in Karma sports car. The company crashed spectacularly, but Fisker, a Danish-born entrepreneur, is back with a new startup focused solely on battery-electric vehicles -- and an unusual business model. The Ocean SUV was designed in house, but its production will be outsourced to avoid the multibillion-dollar cost of building a factory. Future models, now under development, will follow the same path.

Polestar is a little different from other names on this list because it is a spinoff of Volvo and its Chinese parent, Geely. ""But they're still a standalone brand,"" Abuelsamid said, which will have to rise or fall on its own merits. Polestar's first model was a limited-edition, high-performance plug-in hybrid, but the Polestar 2 SUV and all future products will be purely electric.

Neo, one of several domestic Chinese EV startups, has strong aspirations to enter the U.S. market -- and an unusual business model that will either make or break it, analysts suggested. After it struggled for cash in 2019, it has a big infusion, growing sales and a design that relies on swapping batteries so motorists don't have to wait around while charging. The approach has its drawbacks -- but it could prove useful for fleet and commercial buyers.

VinFast, Vietnam's first real car company, was formed in 2017 and had its first model, a gas-powered SUV, on sale two years later. Now it's focusing exclusively on battery-electric vehicles, showing off two at the recent L.A. Auto Show. It just went through a major management shake-up, but ""if a company from any country in the world could make it happen, it's the Vietnamese,"" said Michael Dunne, the head of the consulting firm ZoZo Go. ""They are the most tenacious, ambitious people on the planet.""

Canoo designers certainly don't play it safe. Its minivans move passengers right up to the nose, much like the old VW Microbus, taking advantage of a skateboard-like platform with motors and batteries mounted underneath. That yields a massive interior for passengers and cargo. Canoo's products have generated plenty of buzz, but ""it's still unclear people will want to buy them,"" Abuelsamid said.

Atlis is one of an assortment of startups set to roll out all-electric pickups, although its XT primarily will target fleet and commercial customers who need heavy-duty capabilities. But what many observers are focusing on is the unusual battery-tech Atlis is developing. Its square cells are designed to handle up to a megawatt of power, meaning they could charge up as fast as a driver could fill the gas tank on a regular pickup.

Faraday Future was, not that many years ago, seen as the next Tesla. It rolled out a series of crowd-pleasing concept vehicles, including the FF91 supercar, but it has so far failed to bring anything close to production. After its Chinese billionaire founder pulled out, it had to halt work on an assembly plant in Arizona. Ever since then, it has bounced from one plan to another and continues to struggle to find cash.

Byton has suffered similar setbacks to Faraday Future's. It was seen as extremely promising when it debuted its M-Byte concept at the Consumer Electronics Show just two years ago, but constant management turnover, cash shortages and other problems have crippled the project. The company is abandoning its U.S. headquarters and retreating to China.

Bollinger had a quirky genesis, with its founder wanting an environmentally friendly work truck for his farm in New York state. Like the Atlis XT, the Bollinger B2 pickup and the B1 SUV are aimed at heavy-duty applications, with massive towing and stump-pulling capabilities. But production is way behind schedule, even though Bollinger set up a small operation in suburban Detroit, and the company is reported to be short on cash.

Lordstown Motors seemed to be on its way to stardom with its Endurance commercial pickup. Then, short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report claiming that Lordstown's advance sales numbers were ""fake,"" an allegation that the company effectively acknowledged. Cash raised through a so-called SPAC deal vanished, and the company had to sell its Ohio factory. But Lordstown could yet survive, because Foxconn -- which bought the factory -- has said it might contract to build the Endurance.","{'uri': 'news.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}",[],https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Pv5Vy1w8eTX_HLSHJtzogg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Dx7Gp6TFVDpHMjkZAhQA0g--~B/aD0xNjYzO3c9MjUwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/ca25359414c009872ef94a8a81d3f275,0.2627450980392156,,False,0,0.2627450980392156,378959820,4

They're also promising in-wheel electric motors, active suspension systems, wireless high-speed charging, and revolutionary battery management software at a competitive price.

Is the Indigo too good to be true?

""We are changing the electric vehicle paradigm by leveraging our revolutionary robotic wheels with integrated active suspension and wireless power transfer technologies to build the world's first ultra-efficient electric vehicles with superior ride handling and comfort,"" reads the Indigo Technologies website. And, as run-on sentences go, trust Jo Borrás when he tells you that's certainly one of the good ones.

So, what are we dealing with here, really? The short version is that Indigo is offering two versions of its new electric van, FLOW. The FLOW and FLOW PLUS use ""robotic IndiWheel"" technology that it calls, ""the world's first all-in-one powertrain with simultaneous in-wheel electric propulsion and electric active suspension.""

Hub motors are nothing new, of course. Companies like Aptera and Lordstown Motors have been trying to make them work for a decade (or more, by now), but Indigo's addition of active suspension -- a suspension that effectively predicts road conditions and adjusts the ride height at each corner to keep the vehicle level, as opposed to a passive suspension that simply reacts to the road -- is fairly unique outside the racing world and the odd, early '90s Infiniti Q45t.

Indigo's wireless charging angle, too, is another one that hasn't seen major manufacturer attention in a few years.

The official press release, however, is somewhat light on suspension and charging details, choosing instead to repeat the old bromides that have always surrounded hub motors. ""Indigo invented robotic wheels that uniquely enable more space and comfort for small urban EVs,"" says Will Graylin, CEO of Indigo. ""Without the transmission and motor between the wheels, Indigo FLOW has a low, flat floor that provides more cargo space than any vehicle of its size. And the active suspension in each wheel makes for an amazing ride comfort at an affordable price that people will love.""

The press release also announces that Volker Kaese, former Audi Head of Innovation Product Management, Eric Obers, formerly design leader at Porsche and Lucid, and Hugh Robinson, also formerly of Porsche, have joined the Indigo team.

It'll be interesting to see if Indigo shows up with a fully functional prototype at this week's Consumer Electronics Show, or if they'll ""just"" show a concept or platform. Perhaps tellingly, the company website (as of 7:40PM, EST on 03JAN2021) invites visitors to ""download press image"" (singular).

Electrek's Take

If you're coming out to CES with plans to ""shake up"" the electric delivery and rideshare business by taking on Amazon-backed Rivian, Google-backed Waymo/Zeekr, and established industry giants like Ford, it probably wouldn't kill you to -- psshh, I dunno. Maybe have the Photoshop kid cobble together four renders? Maybe five, if you're feeling really spicy?

The odds that Indigo could get active suspension, wireless high speed charging, and in-wheel motors to work at a price lower than Rivian, Geely, and Ford would be long enough with a fully realized factory (just ask Byton). With one render heading into CES?

Big oof.

The Vision EQXX boasts a claimed range of over 1,000 kilometers (621 miles), or about 100 miles more than the current range champ, the 520-mile Lucid Air. Mercedes didn't achieve that by simply using a bigger battery pack. In fact, at 100 kilowatt-hours of usable capacity, the concept car's pack is close in size to the Air's. Instead, Mercedes focused on making every part of the Vision EQXX -- from tires to batteries -- as efficient as possible.

One specific area of focus was aerodynamics, because the less energy a car needs to expend punching a hole through the air, the farther it can go. The EQXX's flattened nose and elongated tail give it a coefficient of drag (cd) of 0.17, beating Mercedes' own EQS, which is currently the world's most aerodynamic production car. Even the 20-inch wheels were optimized for aerodynamics, while the Bridgestone Turanza Eco tires were designed for ultra-low rolling resistance.

The bodywork also helps with heat management. A system of shutters can draw heat away from the battery pack to keep it cool, or keep heat in to preserve range in colder temperatures. A heat pump draws waste heat from the drivetrain to warm the cabin, too. The pack itself has about the same capacity as the Mercedes EQS pack, but it's half the size and 30% lighter, the automaker claims. The pack is also supplemented by a small solar array.

Mercedes also tapped its Formula One powertrain division to help design a compact drive unit combining the electric motor, transmission, and power electronics. Mercedes said this unit can transfer 95% of the energy from the battery pack to the wheels, making it vastly more efficient than any internal-combustion powertrain. However, with an output of 201 horsepower, it's not exactly overflowing with power.

To keep weight down, Mercedes used software to design parts based on organic forms, using material only in load-bearing areas. The interior also features a number of materials, including vegan silk, a mushroom-based leather substitute, and bamboo fiber, that are both sustainable and lightweight, Mercedes claims. Still, at 3,858 pounds, the Vision EQXX is no Lotus. The battery pack accounts for some of that weight and, because this is a Mercedes, you still get plenty of luxuries, including a massive infotainment screen.

The Vision EQXX isn't destined for production; it was built to demonstrate Mercedes' engineering cleverness. However, elements of it might be incorporated into future production cars. Mercedes hopes to go all-electric in at least some markets by 2030, and is already rolling out new EVs. The recently launched EQS sedan will soon be followed by an EQS SUV, plus an EQE model in both sedan and SUV body styles. Mercedes has also confirmed the smaller EQB SUV for the U.S., and sells the EQA and EQC in other markets.

Bhiri, deputy president of the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, which President Kais Saied views as an enemy, was arrested by plainclothes officers Friday and his whereabouts were initially unknown.

Ennahdha had played a central role in Tunisia politics until a power grab by President Kais Saied last year. Tunisia was the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago, but civil society groups and Saied's opponents have expressed fear of a slide back to authoritarianism a decade after the revolution that toppled longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

On Sunday activists and a former Ennahdha legislator said Bhiri was in a critical condition and facing death. But the source told AFP that Bhiri, 63, is ""not in critical condition for the time being"".

The source, asking not to be named, told AFP that a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the United Nations rights commission visited Bhiri at hospital in the northern town of Bizerte on Sunday.

He is ""lively and lucid"", and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward. Since Friday, however, Bhiri has ""refused to take any food or medication, prompting his transfer to hospital"" two days later, the source said.

Samir Dilou, a lawyer and ex-Ennahdha MP, condemned Bhiri's arrest as ""political"" and an abuse of the justice system. He told a Tunis news conference that he is lodging a ""kidnapping"" charge against Saied and Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine.

Bhiri's wife, Saida Akremi, also a lawyer, told reporters he had suffered ""a heart attack"", and that she was being denied access to him because she refused to sign documents as demanded by security services.

Mondher Ounissi, a doctor and member of Ennahdha's executive bureau, said Sunday that Bhiri suffers from several chronic illnesses, including diabetes and hypertension. He has been ""deprived of his medication"" and ""his life is threatened"", Ounissi said, adding that Bhiri usually takes 16 pills a day.

The interior ministry on Friday said that two individuals had been ordered under house arrest, without identifying them. It said the move was a ""preventive measure dictated by the need to preserve national security"". The anti-torture group INPT has identified the second person detained as Fathi Baldi, a former interior ministry official.","{'uri': 'thenews.com.pk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The News International'}",[],,-0.1058823529411764,eng-7377822,False,0.8784313797950745,-0.1058823529411764,378955560,1

Simply figuring out who is who in this wonderful ethnic tapestry would be an achievement. Yet, this entry level task proved beyond the range of even the most gifted explorers. Dr. Siegfried Frederick Nadel is one person who gave it a good go.

He went to live in the Nupe Kingdom for two years between 1934 and 1936 and somehow managed to start speaking the Nupe language within six months, which was no mean feat, given the tonality of the language.

The result of that immersion was his book A Black Byzantium: The Kingdom of Nupe in Nigeria. The book is not perfect. Written in 1942, Dr. Nadel's book contains what might seem like obvious mistakes today, but this is not down to the all-too-common laziness seen in the work of many Europeans writing about Nigeria.

The task was simply too great and perhaps required a lifetime's commitment. It would not have been possible to write The Game of Thrones in the Niger Heartland, without the understanding of the Nupe Kingdom that was provided by Dr. Nadel's work.

How to write about an important and complex story such as that of the Sokoto Caliphate? The easy part is that there is no shortage of books and articles on an empire that was at one point, the largest bureaucracy in sub-Saharan Africa.

The slightly difficult part is that, as with all complex stories, different accounts often took very different views on what the Caliphate was like. To strike a balance, we relied heavily on Murray Last's The Sokoto Caliphate and H.A.S. Johnston's The Fulani Empire of Sokoto.

Professor Last is luckily still alive, and his indispensable work takes a more academic approach that is critical to understanding how the Caliphate worked, down to the minutiae of offices - grand and petty - and policymaking. H.A.S. Johnston, who was one of several colonial officials that became historians after Nigeria gained independence, wrote a book which is closer to what we might call popular history.

An immensely enjoyable and easy read, he included a lot of insights and local knowledge gained from talking to several people on the ground and travelling the country. What both authors had in common was having access to the outstanding historian of the Sokoto Caliphate - Waziri Muhammadu Junaidu. The Waziri painstakingly built up the largest archive of materials on the Caliphate ranging from books to letters.

In gaining access to him, Professor Last and Mr. Johnston were able to fill in several of their knowledge gaps as outsiders and produce works which we found crucial in writing Formation. Perhaps more than any other, The Caliphate in Session chapter is indebted to these two books. Mervyn Hiskett's The Sword of Truth: The Life and Times of the Shehu Usuman Dan Fodio was a source of some frustration for us.

How is it that there is pretty much only one English biography, and even this shorter than 200 pages, on the life of one of the most consequential people in Nigerian history? While that question remains unanswered, as limited as it is, the late Dr. Hiskett's work proved essential to us in writing about the life of the Shehu in our Son of the Jurist chapter.

In writing about the Yoruba country during the mid-19th century, very few eye-witness accounts in the English Language are as lucid, graphic, authentic and incontrovertible as that of a young American Baptist Minister named Richard Henry Stone, who lived in the country from 1858 and authored a book called In Africa's Forest and Jungle or Six Years Among the Yorubans.

R.H. Stone's amazing first-hand account is another one of those perspective-shifting narratives we love, because he observed important historical events from the unique perspective of a large and important settlement called Ijaiye, which was destroyed as an outcome of regional geopolitics among the Oyo, Egba, Ijebu, Ibadan, Dahomey and Ilorin.

Read also: Writing Nigeria: The sources of Formation (1)

Our understanding of the intimate details of the so-called Yoruba Wars, including the names, addresses and physical descriptions of key actors in the affairs of the Yoruba country after the collapse of Oyo are greatly enriched by the very personal even if self-indulgent account of R.H. Stone.

Personal accounts like Stone's memoirs and the haunting first-hand portrait of King Ghezo's Dahomey titled Dahomey and the Dahomans by Frederick E. Forbes combine with more academic resources like Saburi Biobaku's seminal The Egba and Their Neighbors, and Harry A. Gailey's Lugard and the Abeokuta Uprising, The Demise of Egba Independence to paint the colorful picture of affairs in this part of Nigeria that we put forward in the chapter of Formation that we called Sunrise Within The Tropics.

Writing about the pre-colonial Igbo Country in the hinterland of the Niger Delta was one of the more difficult aspects of the Formation story, because there are so few eye-witness accounts written in any language at all, never mind in English.

But we were lucky that so many excellent Nigerian and foreign historians had done the important work of using oral history sources and dating techniques to bridge this knowledge gap, long before we were born. Nonetheless, we did make a valiant effort to unearth new and perhaps overlooked first-hand historical sources, and we managed to find some.

Not least of these is the invaluable personal history authored by George Thomas Basden (later, Archdeacon of the Niger from 1926), who arrived at Onitsha in September 1900 and was probably the first European to live among the Igbo people from that time until he died in 1936.

Among the Ibos of Nigeria is that rare document, an English language eye-witness account of pre-colonial life in the Igbo country. It is from his account that we can recount a riveting first-hand report of a consultation with the famous Arochukwu Oracle, reflecting the immense power of that longstanding pre-colonial judicial and religious institution on the lives of the ordinary people in the Igbo country.","{'uri': 'businessday.ng', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Businessday NG'}","[{'uri': 'feyi_fawehinmi@businessday.ng', 'name': 'Feyi Fawehinmi', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'fola_fagbule@businessday.ng', 'name': 'Fola Fagbule', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i0.wp.com/businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Formation-of-Nigeria-1.jpg?fit=700%2C400&ssl=1,0.1137254901960785,,False,0,0.1137254901960785,378955440,1

It's time for our look back at the best films of 2021 - a year that saw the delayed releases of most of Hollywood's original 2020 summer slate (we're still waiting on some...) as the film industry looked to fight back after being devastated by the pandemic the year prior.

It's not just been a stream of long-overdue blockbusters though (several of which would likely have been better received had they not already felt a little tired after two-year long marketing campaigns), as cinemas around the world once again opened their doors (hooray!), and many smaller films were able to take advantage of the streaming boom to find an audience.

As ever, our writers here at Flickering Myth have been looking back over the past year's offerings, selecting their personal favourites which we've then collated to create an overall list of our Top Ten Movies of 2021. And here they are...

Directed by Jon Watts.

Starring Tom Holland, Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon, Marisa Tomei, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, and Willem Dafoe.

Including Zack Snyder's Justice League, superhero fans had seven movies to look forward to in 2021, but only one managed to make our top ten with Sony and Marvel's Spider-Man: No Way Home delivering a treat for Spidey fans of every generation, as well as a massive shot in the arm for the theatrical experience.

""With a strong cast and focus on the story and characters, Spider-Man: No Way Home immediately places itself as one of the best Spidey films to date. Holland and Zendaya give incredibly emotional performances as the stakes remain deeply personal in the action set pieces and there is something for Spider-Man fans of every age and preference to enjoy as the legacy of Marvel's web-head is honoured by Watts, Holland and the rest of the team respectfully and epically."" - Read our full review here.

Written and Directed by Fran Kranz.

Starring Jason Isaacs, Martha Plimpton, Reed Birney and Ann Dowd.

Premiering at Sundance back in January 2021, actor-turned-director Fran Kranz announced himself as a filmmaker in style with his feature debut Mass, a powerful and harrowing exploration of grief featuring stellar performances from its cast.

""In the last two decades, several films have boldly broached the topic of school shootings in vastly different but equally compelling ways... Mass makes the case for stripping everything back and instead homing in on the longest serving victims in all of this: the loved ones desperately trying to make sense of an unfathomable tragedy. It's an unflinching study of grief and anger that tackles the difficult questions while avoiding the easy answers. The result is an impeccably-acted humanist drama that will stay with you long after the credits have finished rolling."" - Read our full review here.

Directed by Steven Spielberg.

Starring Ansel Elgort, Rachel Zegler, Rita Moreno, Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist, Corey Stoll, and Brian d'Arcy James.

Steven Spielberg passed on Indiana Jones 5 in favour of a new adaptation of the classic musical West Side Story, and while it may have tanked at the box office, it's the filmmaker's finest offering in years (it's not, however, the FM writers' favourite musical of 2021).

""Steven Spielberg's approach to West Side Story starts from a place of honoring the gripping tale of doomed romance at the core and iconic lyrics from Stephen Sondheim while expanding and strengthening every conceivable detail and character. Put it all together with marvelous, arresting, showstopping direction, whether it's heated dialogue exchanges or reimagined and brilliantly placed musical numbers, and it amounts to a cinematic treat that surpasses the original. Even on its own, this interpretation of West Side Story stands 200 stories high; it's that good."" - Read our full review here.

Directed by Pablo Larrain.

Starring Kristen Stewart, Timothy Spall, Jack Nielen, Freddie Spry, Jack Farthing, Sean Harris, Stella Gonet, Amy Manson and Sally Hawkins.

Kristen Stewart continued to add to her impressive post-Twilight C.V. by taking on the role of Princess Diana in director Pablo Larrain's Spencer, which will almost certainly see the actress following in the footsteps of Larrain's Jackie star Natalie Portman by securing her first Oscar nomination, and - perhaps - go that one step further.

""Positioning itself as an imagined fable from real tragedy, Pablo Larraín's Spencer is a darkly transfixing look at the suffering and oppression plaguing the titular Princess of Wales' life during a time of impending divorce impeccably anchored by a trenchantly sympathetic Kristen Stewart. That's one way of saying that the film has one of the year's best performances inside one of the best movies of the year."" - Read our full review here.

Directed by Leos Carax.

Starring Adam Driver, Marion Cotillard, Simon Helberg, Devyn McDowell, Angèle, Rebecca Dyson-Smith, Ron Mael, and Russell Mael.

Just missing out on our top five by the narrowest of margins is acclaimed French filmmaker Leos Carax's English-language debut Annette, a weird and whimsical musical fantasy that won't be to everyone's taste, but a firm favourite among our writers this year.

""Annette routinely criticizes paparazzi behavior, celebrity culture, and comments on the current state of art, but there are also several personal struggles for the family to tackle, all with spellbinding performances from Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard, while director Leos Carax soaks most scenes in moody lighting, majestic backgrounds, and a dashing of magical realism implying that all bets are off in terms of predictions."" - Read our full review here.

Directed by Julia Ducournau.

Starring Agathe Rousselle, Vincent Lindon, Laïs Salameh, Myriem Akheddiou, Bertrand Bonello and Garance Marillier.

At number five we have Titane, the Palme d'Or winning second feature from French filmmaker Julia Ducournau, who followed her acclaimed 2016 debut Raw with another provocative, unique and unforgettable slice of body horror.

""Titane is a film absolutely packed with ideas, incident and energy, weaving a complex narrative which balances the gory thrills of the midnight movie circuit with the sort of nuanced gender discussion the filmmaker delivered in her first movie. Anyone who sees Titane will find it living in their head rent-free for weeks. Like the metal plate which may or may not be the source of the protagonist's darkness, it's going absolutely nowhere."" - Read our full review here.

Directed by David Lowery.

Starring Dev Patel, Alicia Vikander, Joel Edgerton, Sean Harris, Kate Dickie, Sarita Choudhury, and Ralph Ineson.

At #4 this year we have The Green Knight, an enchanting and absolutely compelling take on the Arthurian legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight from director David Lowery (Pete's Dragon).

""The Green Knight is an enthralling morality tale possessing a profound lyrical beauty that is all its own. It is an intoxicating brew of wild fantasy and high-art that will stupefy your senses, leaving you lucid dazed under its hallucinatory spell."" - Read our full review here.

Directed by Denis Villeneuve.

Starring Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsgård, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Charlotte Rampling.

Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 topped our favourite movies of the year back in 2017, but his latest sci-fi epic Dune has to settle for third place this time around. Roll on Dune: Part Two, which will hopefully complete something very special indeed for sci-fi lovers.

""The world that Villeneuve has built is one of the most impressive since Peter Jackson and his WETA wizards plucked Middle-earth from our imaginations. Aged cities, places which feel as though they ache with history and thousands of stories. These aren't those familiar shiny space veneers, they're locations with real weight and intimidating size. If you were impressed with the way he writ future large for Blade Runner 2049, your jaw will drop lower for the scale of the topography on show here."" - Read our full review here.

Directed by Michael Sarnoski.

Starring Nicolas Cage, Alex Wolff, Adam Arkin, Nina Belforte, Gretchen Corbett, Dalene Young, Darius Pierce, and Cassandra Violet.

The last couple of years have certainly been crazy, but a Nicolas Cage film among the very best of the year?! It was oh so close to number one too, but as it is Pig takes the runner up spot and Cage continues a magnificent run of form that has seen a complete career turnaround from his noughties slump with a performance that puts him right back in the awards mix. Perhaps there's hope for Bruce Willis yet...

""Nicolas Cage and Alex Wolff are easy standouts for some of the best performances of the year so far, the writing is profound, the direction is minimalistic and affecting with a focus on the inner workings of these characters, and the equally nuanced score elevates structures of suspense where it's unclear where this is all going. Memory is another resonant theme here, and it's safe to say anyone that watches Pig will never forget it."" - Read our full review here.

Written and Directed by Jane Campion.

Starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons, Kirsten Dunst, Thomasin McKenzie, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Frances Conroy, and Keith Carradine.

And so, at #1 this year, we have The Power of the Dog, writer-director Jane Campion's masterful return to the big screen after a twelve-year absence. Featuring prominently in the majority of our writers' individual lists (and topping two), The Power of the Dog is the second Netflix feature to lead our annual top ten after Martin Scorsese's The Irishman, and the first from a female filmmaker in the twelve years we've been collating these on the site.

The Power of the Dog so vividly re-creates a place in time with every single shot providing something noteworthy to marvel at, whether it be something discernible about the characters themselves, the vast landscapes, or something as simple yet impressionable as the burning of a cigarette. There are also those damn spurs pounding the floorboards as if Phil is the bogeyman. They are sure to haunt forever, just like the profundity of The Power of the Dog. Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst deliver the performances of their careers, and in a righteous world, Jane Campion will start a streak for female filmmakers winning the Best Director Oscar. - Read our full review here.

And boy, is this a movie you're going to have to see in order to understand a lot of the big stuff happening in Phase 4 of the MCU. But is it actually worth your time?

The titular Eternals are a group of super-powered beings who are tasked with staving off the Deviants, who are trying to kill off human kind. They are given this task by Arishem, a Celestial, aka one of the highest beings in reality that, in essence, run the show. But the group -- comprised of Ajak, Sersi, Ikaris, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Druig, Gilgamesh, and Thena -- split up centuries ago after defeating the last of the Deviants. Or so they thought, until Sersi and Sprite are both attacked by new, stronger Deviants, bringing their quiet existence to an end and necessitating a regrouping. The only problem is that their leader and main connection to Arishem, Ajak, has been killed. Now the rest of the team must reunite if they are to have any chance of saving the Earth, though that might be a bigger job than they thought.

Ultimately, Eternals presents an interesting exercise in world-building that doesn't quite pull off its execution. It sets up what's going to (very likely) be the big bad for the next few films: the Celestials. Its goal is to get the audience as caught up on the massive amount of lore they'll need to understand what the ensuing story is all about. But I think herein lies the problem with the movie, and the overall strategy of the MCU moving forward.

The way Thanos was introduced was slow and careful, spanning several movies and building up as a threat over years. We got to see characters grow and change, team up and break down, and grapple with the ramifications of their actions before Thanos became the big, real threat. But for the Celestials, we get a mention of it in the Thanos story arc, but all of the info-dumping happens in this movie. And not just that but who the Eternals are, who the Deviants are, the larger stakes at play, a serious condition that affects Eternals that could throw a wrench in things, and two literal world-altering events that the heroes will have to contend with. It's a lot of cram into three hours worth of runtime, and that after-credits scene only serves to make things more bizarre and confusing. I get that Marvel has places to go and characters to make us care about before their untimely deaths, but between this and all the elements introduced in Shang-Chi, it feels like a lot.

The other issue that the movie doesn't do a good job of making Eternals feel like it's a part of the MCU. Besides a reference or two to other heroes, this movie could be an entirely separate movie. As such, I had a hard time picturing it as a part of the whole MCU story the way I could with Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Sure, they explain why the Eternals were not a part of the big fight against Thanos and what their purpose is, but that doesn't give me much of a reason to care about them, much less their part in the bigger story.

In terms of the acting, we're getting a mixed bag. Gemma Chan as Sersi brings a lot of warmth and care to the character and the story. Richard Madden as Ikaris is also excellent, as you can really feel his anguish and struggles to do what is right. Lia McHugh as Sprite is also a fun choice, walking the line between relatably tragic and slightly irritating. Angelina Jolie, on the other hand, is absolutely phoning this one in. It doesn't help that her character is supposed be loopy and unresponsive half the time, but the parts where she's supposed to be lucid are two-dimensional. And as much as I like Kumail Nanjiani in just about everything else, he sticks out like sore thumb amongst his teammates, with jokes that don't land and a put-upon air that feels fake.

Barry Keoghan and Lauren Ridloff, who play Druig and Makkari, respectively, have amazing chemistry, and I hope that will be explored in later films. Salma Hayek is only in this for a short time, but the gravity she brings to the story and her character can be felt throughout the film and I love it. Both Brian Tyree Henry and Don Lee are great, but don't get as much time to shine as I would like. And Kit Harrington is...well, he's here, so that's something.

Much has been made of Chloé Zhao coming on to direct after her Oscar-winning turn, and I will say the quality of the direction is undeniable. The film itself looks gorgeous, with excellent use of setting, color, and well-directed action set pieces. My only complaint is that Bollywood scene, which definitely feel like someone who only has a vague notion of what a Bollywood movie looks and sounds like would have made. I do think most of the weakness comes from the premise -- there's just too much to do in one movie and even the best directors struggle under that kind of pressure.

From here on out, we've got to head into spoiler territory, but if you want to see my final thoughts, jump down to the bottom of the article with the ratings.

I like the twist that Ikaris is the villain of the story rather than Druig, who seemed like the obvious choice as the one with mind control powers. I think anyone who has seen Barry Keoghan in anything basically assumes his the villain, or is at least evil-adjacent. But Ikaris's motivations are well-written, and the scene where he sacrifices Ajak for the sake of the mission (at least as he sees it) is heartbreaking. Generally speaking, the way the battle lines are drawn are compelling and make sense, and I'm glad it created some emotional payoff for Seris, Ikaris and Sprite.

The ending, in my opinion, is where this whole endeavor absolutely falls apart. If there is one major, glaring flaws, it's that Eternals did not stick the landing. The final battle was fine, well-choreographed and well-paced, though that one bit with the mutated Deviant Kro and Thena is weirdly intimate in a way that took me out of it for a second. But it's what happens after the battle that really gets me.

The cheesy bit at the end where Sprite becomes human is just a little too neatly wrapped up for me. Having ageless child characters provides some interesting complications to stories, but I feel like they swept her story under the rug super quickly by just ""making her human"" and shipping her off to school. Also the fact that Kingo just comes back after sitting out the big battle at the end? Are there no consequences for him just giving up? The ending just feels way too neatly squared away so they can make an opening for the big bad that's coming down the line and I know Marvel can do better than that.

Also, let's just be real here: the part where Ikaris, having lost, flies into the Sun is both random as Hell and just a touch on the nose.

Having the other Eternals go off to find others like them is a great opener, but that end credits scenes with Eros/Starfox, Thano's previously unmentioned brother, really threw me. I actually thought it was a joke or a parody. Pip, Eros' helper, has such weird CG -- I can't tell if because it lives squarely in the Uncanny Valley or if its too cartoony. And Eros, in all his Harry Styles glory, doesn't look at all like Thanos, so are they siblings through adoption? Marriage? Some sort of fellowship? We will get more answers soon, I'm sure, but the whole thing was just so weird.

The idea that humanity will be judged by Arishem based off the memories of the Eternals presents an interesting jumping off point, with one minor problem. Is this going to matter in any of the subsequent movies? Or maybe better yet, what is the timeline here? There's a giant hand coming out of the Earth, every just saw a massive monster fill up the sky, and all of this is post-Blip and I'm guessing post-No Way Home. Will there be a connection in Multiverse of Madness or Thor: Love and Thunder? It just feels like one big mess, and I feel like a need a conspiracy theory-style flow chart to help me out.

All Exposition, Barely Any Payoff

Eternals presents a fascinating premise, but with 75% of the movie feeling like it's presenting exposition for bigger things to come in other movies, it stands on its own, but atop wobbly legs. Great acting from most of the ensemble and beautiful visuals do not make up for the long runtime, unsatisfying ending, and random dips in pace and action.

Despite these dangers, an enormous quantity of corporations made their public debuts in 2021.

We're speaking Coinbase (COIN), Rent the Runway (RENT), Robinhood (HOOD), and, of course, electrical car makers Lucid (LCID) and Rivian (RVIN). Not each firm that went public carried out effectively, although. While some 399 preliminary public choices raised $142.5 billion in 2021, the bulk of IPOs ended the yr under their preliminary returns.

And whereas the 2022 market will begin off sluggish because of the persevering with pandemic and chip scarcity, a lot of big-name corporations are primed to hit the general public markets this yr.

Think Reddit, Flipkart, and Mobileye to call just a few. And it doesn't cease there. Yahoo Finance spoke with Avery Spear at Renaissance Capital, who gave us the lowdown on the most popular preliminary public choices coming to the markets in 2022.

At the highest of the 2022 IPO checklist is Vietnamese automaker Vinfast. A by-product of Vingroup, a Vietnam-based conglomerate dealing in every thing from actual property to well being care, Vinfast is pivoting to electrical car manufacturing with its eyes on the U.S. and European markets.

""As you've seen with Rivian, [electric vehicles are] a very hot space right now,"" Renaissance's Spear advised Yahoo Finance. ""They've already started taking preorders, which is kind of around where Rivian was when it was coming to the market.""

The firm debuted two electrical autos, the VF e35 and VF e36, on the Los Angeles Auto Show in November and plans to open a whopping 60 showrooms within the U.S. in 2022. The firm plans to start taking pre-orders for its autos within the first half of subsequent yr and have them on the street by the tail finish of 2022.

With a projected $60 billion valuation, Vinfast will enter a U.S. market that's using a wave of EV investments -- whether or not that's Tesla (TSLA), which noticed its valuation skyrocket in 2021 to $1 trillion, or Rivian, which IPO'd in November, elevating almost $12 billion.

Sticking with the automotive trade, Intel (INTC) is planning to spin out its Mobileye enterprise in 2022. Acquired by Intel in 2018 for $15 billion, Mobileye is concentrated on the event of superior driver help techniques (ADAS) with an eye fixed towards growing the know-how wanted to energy self-driving vehicles. The IPO may very well be valued at as a lot as $50 billion, and show to be a boon for chip big Intel.

In December, the corporate launched a robotaxi pilot program testing its autonomous capabilities on the streets of Paris. The transfer will enable workers of the Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann to request a experience to work by way of the robotaxis 4 days every week. A security driver will likely be behind the wheel.

If you didn't know what Reddit was earlier than 2021, the meme inventory craze powered by the favored WallStreetBets subreddit modified that. The sprawling message board boasts greater than 50 million each day lively customers, 100 thousand subreddits, and 50 billion month-to-month views. Yeah, it's variety of an enormous deal. It's no marvel the positioning is sometimes called the web's entrance web page.

Reddit has been round since 2005 providing customers the possibility to talk about every thing from small city happenings to the most effective methods to beating their favourite video video games. But WallStreetBets introduced much more consideration to the service, and performed a serious roll within the retail investor growth.

It's no marvel the corporate, which confidentially filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is aiming for a $15 billion valuation when it goes public subsequent yr.

Walmart-backed (WMT) Flipkart is predicted to hitch the general public markets in 2022 with a valuation of $38 billion. The India-based firm, which competes instantly with Amazon's personal India website, gives every thing from attire to residence home equipment, with 100,000 sellers and 100 million registered customers.

Just this month, Flipkart and Walmart invested $145 million in Indian produce firm Ninjacart as a method to bolster its grocery supply service, a class that has taken off dramatically in India.

Finally, there's software program robotic firm Automation Anywhere. The SoftBank-backed agency helps companies develop items of software program, in any other case often known as bots, that automate duties like information entry for every thing from human assets departments to gross sales and advertising and marketing.

""It's robotic process automation, which, again, is kind of a hot area,"" Spear stated.

The thought is to hurry up operations by chopping down the quantity of time it takes to do historically guide duties. According to Spear, the corporate is valued at just under $7 billion.","{'uri': 'pehalnews.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pehal News'}",[],https://www.pehalnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-5-most-anticipated-IPOs-of-2022.jpeg,-0.07450980392156858,,False,0,-0.07450980392156858,378949560,1

Especially so in Nigeria where the average life expectancy is 54.69. Achieving the 80year milestone is not by hard work. It is not because one had lived by the rules - nutrition rules, health rules, spiritual rules. Or engaged the best doctors. Employed the best nutritionists. Walked gingerly through good and bad roads. A long life as we now understand it is not by mathematical calculations. It is often outside the control of man. So, when a highly visible and iconic public figure as Professor Bolaji Akinyemi turns 80 on the 4 of January 2022, we must roll out the flowers and drums with great panache in thanksgiving to God. As a man of faith, son of a cleric, my big mentor and public service model, Professor Akinyemi acknowledges the grace of God in his life!

His signature cute and ubiquitous bow tie which became the acme of the sartorial elegance of the iconic professor Bolaji Akinwande Akinyemi as a public official in the 1970s has remained etched in our memory and consciousness some thirty-five odd years after he left formal public office. It is true that he has quit public office, first as Director-General Nigeria Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) under the Murtala/Obasanjo military administration and later as Minister of External Affairs under the Ibrahim Babangida administration. Yet, this eclectic public intellectual in the Henry Kissinger tradition has not quit the public space thanks to a very active media presence. He is an interviewer's delight, often displaying a profound and historical if socio-scientific understanding of contemporary national and international political and social issues.

Yet, to reduce our remembrance of Akinyemi to sartorial matters reduces, indeed profanes the gamut of intellectual contributions of this public intellectual to the development of policy framework in Nigeria. As a man who bubbled and still bubbles with big ideas on national development, foreign policy, interethnic relations, international relations, electoral reforms, and national security, Akinyemi straddles decades of public service. In all of this, Akinyemi comes forth as a man who spoke truth before its time! What else can we say of a man who in 1987 proposed the need for the 'black bomb? Or a man who had the temerity to suggest the Technical Aid Corps idea to a military government and had the energy and gusto to see it implemented?

In the heady days of the military in government in Nigeria, one institution that stood out both in quality of activities and presence in the media was the Nigeria Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) where Akinyemi directed affairs from 1975 till 1983. He worked with military Head of State late General Murtala Mohammed whom he had access to on policy formulation and implementation. No one familiar with Nigeria's foreign policy at the time in question would forget Murtala's 'African has Come of Age' speech and the tough stance Nigeria took on South Africa and the liberation movement in southern Africa. The seminars, lectures, and conferences organised by NIIA were a regular in the academic space of Nigeria, a veritable town and academia dialogue. All events were highly visible, what with the presence of who-is-who in government at the time, from both the Executive and judicial arms of government. Generals, other army officers and public intellectuals made the NIIA a regular in the calendar of social engagements. Visiting Heads of State and Prime Ministers inevitably stopped by at the NIIA for public lectures. It was during the years when public officials dared to engage in academic discourse, entertaining a variety of ideas and strategies. Whatever happened to that culture? The fecund mind and energetic man behind the foremost position of NIIA was the then Dr. Bolaji Akinyemi, a returnee from American and British universities located at the University of Ibadan. How was he able to pull such quality crowds to the lecture hall of the NIIA? That that institute has become a shell speaks volumes of the man Akinyemi.

At the Ministry of External Affairs where he held sway from 1985 to 1987, Akinyemi brought a high quality of thinking into diplomacy. It was during this period that he showed the charisma of a Kissinger in diplomatic and foreign affairs, attending and representing Nigeria in different international events. We had referred to the Technical Aid Corps (TAC) scheme which saw Nigeria exporting manpower to less fortunate countries. The purpose of the scheme was 'to promote the country's image and status as a major contributor to Third World and particularly African development'. Professionals such as medical doctors, engineers and teachers served in the programme and projected the image of Nigeria as a medium power in world affairs. He developed a principled framework that underpinned the trajectory of foreign policy at this time- the 'Concert of Medium Powers'. It was dramatic to name his call for Nigeria to develop nuclear technology the 'Black bomb', with all the innuendos on the word 'black'. Yet it resonated across the country and some thirty five years after, we still pine over lack of energy generation and supply!

An ardent believer in the corporate existence of a restructured Nigeria, Professor Bolaji Akinyemi does not look 80, does not walk 80, does not work 80, does not think 80, and certainly does not think 80! His thoughts are lucid, his speech pattern measured as a statesman, sure and certain; and his power of recollection almost as sharp as it was thirty years ago! What else does one ask of God at Age 80?

Outside government, Akinyemi forayed into national activism under the aegis of NADECO when the time came to challenge the fatal impunity of Maximum Ruler General Sanni Abacha. Sacrificing his comfort and safety he went on exile through the popular 'NADECO route', with all its hazards. The thrilling drama of a sudden exit from Lagos in full disguise, facilitated by coded actions and words and a small chain of helpers, to escape the murder squad of the Abacha days is a story for another day, forthcoming in his biography. The academic became a hero in the fight for democracy. And when he returned to Nigeria after the restoration of democracy, the Yar'Adua and Jonathan governments respectively appointed him to serve the nation in committee work - the Electoral Reform Panel, Committee on Boko Haram, and the 2014 National Confab in which he functioned as Deputy Chairman. He still gives lectures on policymaking and implementation though in 1983, he gave a highly cerebral lecture on 'A Farewell to Policy'!

Professor Bolaji still carries the smile of youth in his old age, with the infinite capacity to laugh robustly when the need arises, with the appropriate anecdotes and jokes. I admire his ability to take on serious issues of national and international importance with remarkable aplomb and consummate dexterity, practically thinking on his feet. He still maintains the poise of yore, with the well-maintained afro-hair style. An ardent believer in the corporate existence of a restructured Nigeria, Professor Bolaji Akinyemi does not look 80, does not walk 80, does not work 80, does not think 80, and certainly does not think 80! His thoughts are lucid his speech pattern measured as a statesman, sure and certain; and his power of recollection almost as sharp as it was thirty years ago! What else does one ask of God at Age 80?

In concluding this tribute at 80 to a distinguished scholar, father, and grandfather, academic, public intellectual, mentor, foreign policy adviser, a team player in committee work, social-cum political activist and foremost visionary in the corridors of power I dare say that Akinyemi is a man who spoke truth before its time. At 80, it may not be creation morning; still, it is not an exit time for a man whose training in Igbobi College, Christ School Ado Ekiti, Temple University Philadelphia, Tufts University Massachusetts, and Trinity College Oxford prepared him for the world of ideas and service to humanity! And as we used to say at The Guardian Editorial Board, being 80 has implications!","{'uri': 'thenewsnigeria.com.ng', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The NEWS'}",[],https://cdn.thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2021/12/Hope-ORukevbe-Eghagha99.jpg?w=640,0.2784313725490195,eng-7382006,False,0.8274509906768799,0.2784313725490195,378947700,3

With a projected $60 billion valuation, Vinfast will enter a U.S. market that's riding a wave of EV investments -- whether that's Tesla (TSLA), which saw its valuation skyrocket in 2021 to $1 trillion, or Rivian, which IPO'd in November, raising nearly $12 billion.

Sticking with the automotive industry, Intel (INTC) is planning to spin out its Mobileye business in 2022. Acquired by Intel in 2018 for $15 billion, Mobileye is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) with an eye toward developing the technology needed to power self-driving cars. The IPO could be valued at as much as $50 billion, and prove to be a boon for chip giant Intel.

In December, the company launched a robotaxi pilot program testing its autonomous capabilities on the streets of Paris. The move will allow employees of the Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann to request a ride to work via the robotaxis four days a week. A safety driver will be behind the wheel.

If you didn't know what Reddit was before 2021, the meme stock craze powered by the popular WallStreetBets subreddit changed that. The sprawling message board boasts more than 50 million daily active users, 100 thousand subreddits, and 50 billion monthly views. Yeah, it's kind of a big deal. It's no wonder the site is often referred to as the internet's front page.

Reddit has been around since 2005 offering users the chance to chat about everything from small town happenings to the best strategies to beating their favorite video games. But WallStreetBets brought even more attention to the service, and played a major roll in the retail investor boom.

It's no wonder the company, which confidentially filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is aiming for a $15 billion valuation when it goes public next year.

Walmart-backed (WMT) Flipkart is expected to join the public markets in 2022 with a valuation of $38 billion. The India-based company, which competes directly with Amazon's own India site, offers everything from apparel to home appliances, with 100,000 sellers and 100 million registered users.

Just this month, Flipkart and Walmart invested $145 million in Indian produce company Ninjacart as a means to bolster its grocery delivery service, a category that has taken off dramatically in India.

Finally, there's software robot company Automation Anywhere. The SoftBank-backed firm helps businesses develop pieces of software, otherwise known as bots, that automate tasks like data entry for everything from human resources departments to sales and marketing.

""It's robotic process automation, which, again, is kind of a hot area,"" Spear said.

The idea is to speed up operations by cutting down the amount of time it takes to do traditionally manual tasks. According to Spear, the company is valued at just below $7 billion.","{'uri': 'sg.news.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}",[],https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mGJVoQR.tvgray94dvlX4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/254769f0-6ccf-11ec-9fe3-1b2b2b2acbbc,0.01960784313725483,,True,0,0.01960784313725483,378947700,1

The Vision EQXX was unveiled virtually at the Consumers Electronics Show (CES), as Mercedes is one of the many companies that opted out of attending in-person over concerns of the coronavirus.

EQXX is solar-powered and designed with recycled and sustainable materials including mushroom fibers, ground up cacti and trash such as food scraps.

Mercedes-Benz pulled the wraps on its new all-electric Vision EQXX car on Monday, boasting the luxury vehicle has a 648-mile range per charge. Although still a concept, the vehicle now holds the record for EV with the most miles on a single charge - Lucid offers 520 miles and Tesla provides 402 miles

During the livestream, the company touted the concept car's compact design and efficient battery.

EQXX, dubbed the most-efficient Mercedes-Benz ever built, will have energy consumption of less than 10 kilowatt hours (kWh) per 100 km, or six miles per kWh.

That is almost three times farther per kilowatt hour than a Tesla Model S Long Range, according to US EPA estimates.

Mercedes also describes the shape as 'more aerodynamic than a football and the interior boasts a free-floating, one-piece display, all of which provides a sleek, yet minimalist feel.

And it is also designed with sustainable material - the leather is made from the underground root-like structures of mushrooms and bamboo fibers make up the carpets.

Mercedes also describes the shape as 'more aerodynamic than a football and the interior boasts a free-floating, one-piece display, all of which provides a sleek, yet minimalist feel.

The inside of EQXX has a giant 47.5-inch touchscreen that spans across the entire dashboard and is AI-powered to provide drivers with the best directions and suggestions while cruising down the road.

Mercedes says is working with a company called NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop 'the first real-time 3D navigation system' for a touchscreen this size.

When implemented, the system will provide 'seamless zoom and scroll functions from satellite view down to a height of 10 meters in the 3D city representation,' the company says.

The outside of EQXX, which Mercedes says is a sculpture of beauty, includes a material found in landfill waste, known as UBQ.

UBQ is an innovation from Israel that is a combination of mixed plastics, cardboard, gardening waste and even diapers, according to Mercedes.

EQXX is powered by 117 solar panels that are installed on its roof, which can add up to 15 miles of range on long-distance journeys under ideal conditions in a single day.

First game on our list: Balan Wonderworld. In this 3D platform developed by Sonic's father, the player has to collect as many balan statuettes as possible in order to open new levels and advance with them. To spice things up, the title published by Square Enix includes disguises to restore that allow the acquisition of various skills.

Unfortunately, almost nothing goes well in this poorly mastered game design game. The disguises, while numerous, are too often useless, worse, prevent jumping as their abilities are activated by the same and single action button. An amateurish defect that we thought we wouldn't see in games of our time. To make matters worse, the game suffers from a camera problem and some powers are activated randomly. When does an episode of the Grenier Player appear?

Outriders, another game published by Square Enix, doesn't shine for the interest of its single-player campaign with a very sketchy scenario. This shooter looter primarily relies on its visual effects made possible by Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4 engine, its cooperative mode, and its online playability.

Apart from the fact that the instability of the game is such that the servers crash regularly, generating countless disconnections and causing immense frustration among the players. Picking up forks did not take long to multiply on the networks, indicating the impossibility of playing solo or in matchmaking. Additionally, a bug in the Square Enix title has been fixed: the one that removes all of the player's inventory but makes hard money. While the developers rolled out a corrective patch in response, the problem worsened, resulting in many gamers giving up their games for good.

How do I get started with the successor to the late and iconic PES license? In Konami wanted to start from scratch to capitalize on the free-to-play model and thus return to the competition against Electroncs Arts and its staunch FIFA, Konami has had both feet in the carpet. The simulation is poor, the bugs are abundant and the graphics really leave a lot to be desired. Paroxysm of this void, the modeling of the player. An atrocity like the faces of Messi or Ronaldo have become memes.

A cleanup for Konami, whose title received the lowest rating on the Steam platform with a ridiculous 9% positive ratings for 11,554 reviews. Fifa can safely sail towards 2022.

Less than a week after the e-football 2022 GTA Trilogy: The Definitive Edition was released. By keeping players waiting for GTA VI to be released endlessly, Rockstar is returning to basics and releasing three licensed hits on a single disc that are to be tweaked for the occasion.

But already with the first pictures with the bike we noticed that some things are not right. The cartoon accent that Rockstar used on his character design isn't sexy. Some characters are so deformed that they provoke the anger and ridicule of the players on the networks. In addition, clipping, frequent drops in the frame rate, certain texture problems (like rain) or the devalued soundtrack make people shudder. Even the gameplay is considered archaic, so many players are screaming for the beta.

Given this, the New York house came out of its silence last month with promises of corrective updates and patches. But Rockstar has instead chosen to give preference to PC gamers rather than offering these fixes by offering compensation for purchasing the trilogy by giving them a choice of Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto IV, Max Payne 3, LA Noire or Bully offers. : Scholarship edition.

A month of November and an autumn of 2021 that will not go down in the annals of the video game world. To stand out from Activision, which opts for a (rather failed) return to World War II with Call of Duty: Vanguard, which was released in early November, EA relies on its multiplayer mode with Battlefield 2042.

However, the optimization and implementation of the game from the start leaves a lot to be desired, many lags are reported by the players as well as very poor PC optimization, not displayed icons, poorly thought out spawns and so on. a range of bugs affecting characters, weapons, deadly equipment, or even environments. The pill won't go and the game will follow e-football 2022 in the fall as the game garners no less than 32,000 negative reviews for just 10,000 positive reviews on Steam, which is among the top 10 worst games.

Above all, Battlefield 2042 has seen a dazzling review bombing of the community, but strictly speaking it is not a bad game, on the PC the press even praises its content (7 gigantic maps, portal mode, Hazard Zoned). The game looks very good. It's a shame that these mistakes of all kinds spoil the experience.

Unless it's actually a bad game, Far Cry 6's place in this ranking is more of another curse word addressed to its publisher Ubisoft, which is getting more and more (and for some time) bogged down in conformism Assasin's Creed license and thus Far Cry.

If Ubisoft Toronto's game is honestly beautiful, the adventure is fun, and the super villain (Breaking Bad, The Mandalorian) played by Giancarlo Esposito is charismatic - which is one of the advantages of the license - the AI lags behind and the gameplay is nothing new . So the player has the impression of being subject to the eternal recycling of the studio for years. In 2021 this will no longer be acceptable.

The story surrounding the release of Destruction Allstars got off to a bad start. Announced as the starter for the launch of the PS5, the game was ultimately postponed. Fixed at a high price of 80 euros, it was finally integrated into the PS +. All of this did not bode well in terms of communication and marketing.

But Destruction Allstars wanted to bring an almost 20 year old recipe up to date, a mixture of Battle Royal and Demolition Derby (car fighting game). Where four players used to compete in an arena, the exclusivity of Sony therefore enables an online multiplayer mode.

Unfortunately, players quickly left the arenas, which resulted in the Lucid Games studio replacing them with bots. Still, due to the lack of regular content and the lack of an old-gen version, it is very rare for the few players to find a decent game. We know that since it was released, it has always been complicated to find a PS5 that should have stuck the chip in the publisher's ear.

They are called Indigo Flow and Indigo Flow Plus. 12 photos The start-up company promises to deliver ""an entirely new class of smooth, roomy, and affordable"" electric vehicles. The last part is even more interesting in our view, and the company claims that its vehicles can operate at a lower cost than any other model in its class.

As Indigo Technologies notes, the Flow should surpass a Toyota RAV4 in ride ""smoothness,"" space, all at a lower operating cost. Meanwhile, the creators of the Flow Plus, which is supposed to be a utility vehicle, say that it is better than the Ford Transit Connect in the aspects mentioned above.

We do not think that it is necessary to point out that the two models built by Toyota, and Ford, respectively, work with fossil fuels and are not available in electric versions.

Unlike the two production vehicles mentioned above, the two models offered by Indigo Technologies are not yet in production. Its creators say their vehicles will provide more than 250 miles (ca. 402 km) of range with a battery that has a capacity of just 40 kWh. If the estimated range is obtained in real life, the result would be competitive if you ask us. Their creators have not announced if and when they will start manufacturing the Flow or the Flow Plus, and their price is not yet listed.

If we go past their exterior design, we will notice that their interior has a central driving position. Behind the driver, the passenger-oriented version gets two rows of seats, while the utility version (Flow Plus) has room for cargo.

The folks at Indigo Technologies also pride themselves on the fact that they were joined by Volker Kaese, the former Head of Innovation Product Management of Audi. Kaese is Indigo's new Chief Technology Officer. Previously in his career, he led the development of the Volkswagen XL1, as well as Audi's e-tron concept vehicles.

More than 2,200 exhibitions will be shown at the much-anticipated three-day event starting on Wednesday, albeit in a scaled-down form amidst the COVID-19 spike.

CES, which historically has been Las Vegas' largest annual trade show, was initially scheduled to run for four days, but the spread of the Omicron variant prompted organizers to cancel Saturday's schedule as a precaution after a number of big-name exhibitors dropped out.

It will be the first in-person CES event since 2020. The conference, which normally draws more than 170,000 people and up to 4,000 exhibitors, will be scaled down this year due to the ongoing pandemic, according to organizers.

Among the blue chip companies that have backed out of this year's festivities are tech heavyweights like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Twitter, Meta Platforms, Inc (the company formerly known as Facebook), Lenovo Group, AT&T, T-Mobile, BMW, General Motors, Waymo, and Advanced Micro Devices.

But the grim news linked to the spread of Omicron failed to put a damper on the enthusiasm for the previews and media events that were scheduled to be held at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Monday and Tuesday.

One car company that hopes to make a splash this week is Mercedes-Benz, which is unveiling its Vision EQXX, a solar-powered electric car that the German automaker says can drive more than 650 miles on a single charge.

Mercedes, like its rivals BMW and General Motors, canceled its in-person exhibit at the conference and unveiled the electric vehicle virtually. The company did not say when the vehicle will be going into production.

If the product can deliver the goods, Vision EQXX would best other top electric vehicles on the market, including the Tesla Model S Long Range Plus, which lasts 402 miles from a single charge, and the Lucid Air, which can exceed 520 miles on a single charge.

Mercedes-Benz is looking to compete in the luxury EV space currently occupied by the likes of Porsche Taycan, Audi E-tron GT and the Tesla Roadster.

GM will unveil its all-electric pickup truck. The firm's CEO Mary Barra will remotely address the conference while discussing the company's vision for its Silverado EV.

The vehicle is expected to go on sale in 2024, though the company has not indicated how much it will cost.

The Silverado EV has a large battery pack that is said to allow for 400 miles of driving on a single charge, according to Car and Driver

Samsung will reveal its new ""My House"" virtual home where users can enter its metaverse and browse the company's menu of home appliances and products.

A metaverse is a web of three-dimensional virtual worlds that is aimed at fostering greater social connection. It can be accessed through virtual and augmented reality headsets.

Owo, a Spanish tech company, will unveil a wireless wearable vest that when worn will give the user the physical experience of being connected to the metaverse.

The Owo vest uses haptic technology to employ vibrations that simulate events like getting hit by a ball, getting hugged, or catching a ball. The vest is being tested with video games, according to USA Today.

New gadgets will also make use of augmented reality, which superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, to recreate a life-like shopping experience.

PulpoAR, a startup with headquarters in the United States and Turkey, is unveiling a ""virtual makeup chair"" that allows consumers to test lipstick, eyeliner, and other makeup products before buying them online.

Asimula, a Korean vendor, will feature virtual reality headsets where users can experience the feeling of being in a live concert.

Vuzix, the Rochester, New York-based firm, will unveil augmented reality safety glasses that can send and receive data and video, including sporting events and games, through 5G technology.

A tech conference wouldn't be complete without an appearance by Ameca, which is billed as ""the world's most advanced human shaped robot representing the forefront of human-robotics technology.""

Developed by the United Kingdom-based Engineered Arts, Ameca is ""the perfect humanoid robot platform for human-robot interaction.""

Ameca features ""advanced facial expression capabilities"" which allow it to ""strike an instant rapport with anybody.""

It is fitted with sensors, face recognition technology, microphones mounted in its ear, and cameras affixed to the eyes.

The life-like robot is capable of expressing human emotions through gestures conveying anger, surprise, boredom, astonishment, and curiosity.

Back in September 2021, the automaker revealed five new vehicles in one auto show - the EQE sedan, the EQB crossover, the EQG Concept, the Maybach EQS SUV, and the AMG EQS. That hasn't stopped the automaker. Fast forward to the present day, the German automaker has unveiled the Vision EQXX Concept, a vehicle it teased back in July last year. The highlight of the car is the range - 620 miles or 1,000 kilometers. Does it have your attention now?

If you are not into unorthodox designs, you may not find the EQXX very attractive. The face looks aggressive, with the raised-eyebrow DRLs and headlights adorning the same design. There is a huge Mercedes logo on the vented hood. The automaker noted that the EQXX is equipped with an advanced thermal management system that contributes to maximum efficiency. It works in tandem with aero shutters, coolant valves, water pumps, etc. that help keep the battery temperature optimum at most times to extract the best efficiency possible.

The speedtail design is evident from the side profile. When viewed from here, it has some resonance to the Porsche Taycan. The EQXX rides on 20-inch, lightweight, forged-magnesium wheels with a semi-transparent double-spoke design. These wheels are wrapped in Bridgestone Turanza Eco tires.

The rear is the most polarizing aspect of the car. There is a long LED strip that bends downwards at the end. If I didn't know any better, I'd say this is a ripped-off version of the Kia EV6!

Given that the battery itself weighs almost 1,100 pounds, the Mercedes-Benz EQXX is pretty light at 3,858 pounds. As for the other dimensions, it has a wheelbase of 110.2 inches and is around 182 inches long.

The cabin looks quite nice overall. You have four bucket seats in total with a lot of tech features. The interior is devoid of any animal-derived products. Instead, Mercedes has used vegan silk, biosteel fiber, bamboo fiber, etc. in here. There are a couple of other sustainable materials like the MyloTM that's used for the seat cushions, and Deserttex, which is a cactus-based biomaterial made from cactus fibers.

The EQXX features a screen that runs the entire width. From one A-pillar to the other, it spans 47.5 inches! The screen has an 8K resolution and is powered by the automaker's UX infotainment system.

Mercedes-Benz claims that the Vision EQXX will deliver 621 miles or 1,000 kms on a full charge. To put things into perspective, you can travel from Berlin to Paris, or from New York City to Cincinnati, Ohio, on a fully charged battery without having to stop to recuperate.

The 620+ mile range is courtesy of a 100 kWh battery pack. This translates to consumption of over six miles per kWh. So far, this is the best that we've heard of. It even trumps the Lucid Air's efficiency of 4.58 miles per kWh.

Mercedes also noted that 95-percent of energy from the battery ends up at the wheels, which is also one of the reasons for such high output from the battery pack. The battery itself is state of the art. It is said to have 50-percent less volume and is 30-percent lighter than the one equipped in the EQS. It weighs 1,091 pounds in total.

There are 117 solar cells on the roof that can add up to 15 miles of range every day on long-distance journeys. This is under ideal conditions. The primary duty of this, however, is to power the infotainment system, the lights, and other ancillaries. This is slowly becoming a trend. We've heard of the solar roof on the Lightyear One, the Triton Solar Model H, the Thundertruck, and the Fisker Ocean. Even the Cybertruck could have it down the line. There are also solar panel Tonneau covers that could become a hot commodity once EVs become mainstream.

There are a lot of factors that aid efficiency, and one of the most important ones is the drag coefficient rating. The Vision EQXX boasts of a drag coefficient of just 0.17! Mercedes calls this concept the blueprint of the series production model, so we're guessing there won't be much of a difference in the rating of the production-spec model.

If the company is able to keep it under 0.20, then it will be the world's most aerodynamically efficient car, beating the Mercedes EQS. For now, the latter holds the record. There are concepts like the Volkswagen XL1 and the GM EV1 that are rated at 0.189 and 0.19 respectively, but that are not series production models like the EQS.

There's no word on when the EQXX will be made into a production model, but it will happen for sure at some point. We don't have any word on its powertrain and power outputs either.

Despite those risks, a huge number of companies made their public debuts in 2021.

We're talking Coinbase (COIN), Rent the Runway (RENT), Robinhood (HOOD), and, of course, electric vehicle makers Lucid (LCID) and Rivian (RVIN). Not every company that went public performed well, though. While some 399 initial public offerings raised $142.5 billion in 2021, the majority of IPOs ended the year below their initial returns.

And while the 2022 market will start off slow thanks to the continuing pandemic and chip shortage, plenty of big-name firms are primed to hit the public markets this year.

Think Reddit, Flipkart, and Mobileye to name a few. And it doesn't stop there. Yahoo Finance spoke with Avery Spear at Renaissance Capital, who gave us the lowdown on the hottest initial public offerings coming to the markets in 2022.

At the top of the 2022 IPO list is Vietnamese automaker Vinfast. A spinoff of Vingroup, a Vietnam-based conglomerate dealing in everything from real estate to health care, Vinfast is pivoting to electric vehicle manufacturing with its eyes on the U.S. and European markets.

""As you've seen with Rivian, [electric vehicles are] a very hot space right now,"" Renaissance's Spear told Yahoo Finance. ""They've already started taking preorders, which is kind of around where Rivian was when it was coming to the market.""

The company debuted two electric vehicles, the VF e35 and VF e36, at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November and plans to open a whopping 60 showrooms in the U.S. in 2022. The company plans to begin taking pre-orders for its vehicles in the first half of next year and have them on the road by the tail end of 2022.

With a projected $60 billion valuation, Vinfast will enter a U.S. market that's riding a wave of EV investments -- whether that's Tesla (TSLA), which saw its valuation skyrocket in 2021 to $1 trillion, or Rivian, which IPO'd in November, raising nearly $12 billion.

Sticking with the automotive industry, Intel (INTC) is planning to spin out its Mobileye business in 2022. Acquired by Intel in 2018 for $15 billion, Mobileye is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) with an eye toward developing the technology needed to power self-driving cars. The IPO could be valued at as much as $50 billion, and prove to be a boon for chip giant Intel.

In December, the company launched a robotaxi pilot program testing its autonomous capabilities on the streets of Paris. The move will allow employees of the Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann to request a ride to work via the robotaxis four days a week. A safety driver will be behind the wheel.

If you didn't know what Reddit was before 2021, the meme stock craze powered by the popular WallStreetBets subreddit changed that. The sprawling message board boasts more than 50 million daily active users, 100 thousand subreddits, and 50 billion monthly views. Yeah, it's kind of a big deal. It's no wonder the site is often referred to as the internet's front page.

Reddit has been around since 2005 offering users the chance to chat about everything from small town happenings to the best strategies to beating their favorite video games. But WallStreetBets brought even more attention to the service, and played a major roll in the retail investor boom.

It's no wonder the company, which confidentially filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is aiming for a $15 billion valuation when it goes public next year.

Walmart-backed (WMT) Flipkart is expected to join the public markets in 2022 with a valuation of $38 billion. The India-based company, which competes directly with Amazon's own India site, offers everything from apparel to home appliances, with 100,000 sellers and 100 million registered users.

Just this month, Flipkart and Walmart invested $145 million in Indian produce company Ninjacart as a means to bolster its grocery delivery service, a category that has taken off dramatically in India.

Finally, there's software robot company Automation Anywhere. The SoftBank-backed firm helps businesses develop pieces of software, otherwise known as bots, that automate tasks like data entry for everything from human resources departments to sales and marketing.

""It's robotic process automation, which, again, is kind of a hot area,"" Spear said.

The idea is to speed up operations by cutting down the amount of time it takes to do traditionally manual tasks.

Over the past 75 years, many startups have tried to crack the code and enter the U.S. automotive market. Virtually none have succeeded.

Tesla is the rare exception, taking advantage of the emerging interest in battery-electric vehicles. Its sales nearly doubled during 2021, rising to 960,172 vehicles. And, with two more plants opening -- in Berlin and Austin, Texas -- it's expected to quickly blast through the 1 million mark this year. That is providing a note of hope for the dozen or more competitors hoping to match the California-based automaker's success.

Long-skeptical investors have recently shown great readiness to embrace the most promising of these newcomers. But some are struggling for capital and may not make it into production, analysts warn.

""The potential some of these startups have is that they're breaking into a nascent EV market that has doubled in size this past year and is ready to take off,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, principal auto analyst with Guidehouse Insight.

""There is suddenly a vibrant market that traditional manufacturers have been slow to tap into,"" Abuelsamid said, noting that ""the window of opportunity is a narrow one and closing fast,"" as companies like General Motors, Ford, Hyundai and Volkswagen prepare to unleash scores of new, long-range BEVs of their own by mid-decade.

Here's a look at some of the strongest and weakest of the EV startups, as well as a few others yet to clearly show whether they can plug in and light up the market.

Rivian is arguably the strongest of all the new startups, most analysts agree. The company has piles of cash, and the backing of early investors like Ford and Amazon. The online retailer's Prime service has an outstanding order for 100,000 Rivian delivery trucks. And its R1T pickup is now on sale -- and was named Motor Trend Truck of the Year. Production hiccups worried investors, but it still has a market capitalization north of $90 billion, more than either GM or Ford.

Lucid CEO and Chief Technology Officer Peter Rawlinson was the man who whipped the original Tesla Model S into shape -- and that helped him set new benchmarks for the startup's own Lucid Air sedan. Two versions of the initial launch edition are now on sale, one making 1,100 horsepower, the other delivering over 500 miles range, an industry best. The price tag? An exotic $160,000. But Lucid has plans for a mix of more mainstream sedans and SUVs.

Fisker takes its name from Henrik Fisker, who earned kudos as a designer for Aston Martin. He launched his first brand with the plug-in Karma sports car. The company crashed spectacularly but the Danish-born entrepreneur is back with a new startup focused solely on BEVs -- and an unusual business model. The Ocean SUV was designed in house, but its production will be outsourced to avoid the multibillion-dollar cost of building a factory. Future models, now under development, will follow the same path.

Polestar is a little different from other names on this list because it is actually a spin-off of Volvo and its Chinese parent Geely. ""But they're still a standalone brand,"" said Abuelsamid, that will have to rise or fall on its own merits. Polestar's first model was a limited-edition, high-performance plug-in hybrid, but the Polestar 2 SUV and all future products will be purely electric.

Neo is one of a number of domestic Chinese EV startups. But it has strong aspirations to enter the U.S. market -- and an unusual business model that will either make or break it, analysts suggest. After struggling for cash in 2019, it has a big infusion, growing sales and a design that relies on swapping batteries so motorists don't have to wait around while charging. The approach has its drawbacks -- but could prove useful for fleet and commercial buyers.

VinFast, Vietnam's first real car company, was formed in 2017 and had its first model, a gas-powered SUV, on sale two years later. Now, it's focusing exclusively on BEVs, showing off two at the recent L.A. Auto Show. It just went through a major management shake-up, but ""If a company from any country in the world could make it happen, it's the Vietnamese,"" said Michael Dunne, head of consulting firm ZoZo Go. ""They are the most tenacious, ambitious people on the planet.""

Canoo designers certainly don't want to play it safe. Its minivans move passengers right up to the nose, much like the old VW Microbus, taking advantage of a skateboard-like platform with motors and batteries mounted underneath. That yields a massive interior for passengers and cargo. Canoo's products have generated plenty of buzz, but ""it's still unclear people will want to buy them,"" said Abuelsamid.

Atlis is one of an assortment of startups set to roll out all-electric pickups, though its XT primarily will target fleet and commercial customers who need heavy-duty capabilities. Yet, what many observers are focusing on is the unusual battery-tech Atlis is developing. Its square cells are designed to handle up to a megawatt of power, meaning they could charge up as fast a driver could fill the gas tank on a regular pickup.

Faraday Future was, not that many years ago, seen as the next Tesla. It rolled out a series of crowd-pleasing concept vehicles, including the FF91 supercar, but has so far failed to bring anything close to production. After its Chinese billionaire founder pulled out, it had to halt work on an Arizona assembly plant. Ever since, it has bounced from one plan to another and continues struggling to find cash.

Byton has suffered similar setbacks to Faraday Future. It was seen as extremely promising when it debuted its M-Byte concept at CES just two years ago, but constant management turnover, cash shortages and other problems have crippled the project. The company is now abandoning its U.S. headquarters and retreating to China.

Bollinger had a quirky genesis, with its founder wanting an environmentally friendly work truck for his farm in New York State. Like the Atlis XT, the Bollinger B2 pickup and B1 SUV are aimed at heavy-duty applications, with massive towing and stump-pulling capabilities. But production is way behind schedule, despite setting up a small suburban Detroit operation, with the company reportedly short on cash.

Lordstown Motors seemed on its way to stardom with its own Endurance commercial pickup. Then, short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report claiming Lordstown's advance sales numbers were ""fake,"" a charge the company effectively acknowledged. Cash raised through a SPAC deal vanished and the company had to sell its Ohio factory. But Lordstown could yet survive, since Foxconn -- which bought the factory -- has said it might now contract to build the Endurance.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2021-12/211229-rivian-2019-ac-540p-bdef30.jpg",0.2705882352941176,,False,0,0.2705882352941176,378943620,4

Mercedes-Benz took the wraps off of a striking electric concept car on Monday. Meet the Vision EQXX.

You probably won't be able to buy a Mercedes exactly like the Vision EQXX anytime soon. But some of the advancements Mercedes developed here could make their way into your future electric Benz.

If range anxiety is the fear of running out of energy in an electric car, Mercedes wants the EQXX to be something like a chill pill.

Mercedes built the EQXX to be its most efficient car, it said -- one that demonstrates that range anxiety could become a thing of the past.

The Vision EQXX should deliver at least 620 miles of driving range on a full battery, Mercedes says. That beats the rangiest electric car you can buy today (the $170,000 Lucid Air) by 100 miles.

If Mercedes' claims are true, the EQXX would beat the longest-range Tesla by more than 200 miles.

But Mercedes didn't just give the EQXX a gigantic battery pack and call it a day. It says it's engineered the EQXX to deliver more range using less energy.

Mercedes gave the EQXX a teardrop shape that lets it slip through the air even better than the EQS, the company's electric flagship. Mercedes says the EQXX is more aerodynamic than a football.

The EQXX also gets special tires that cut down on rolling resistance ...

... and lightweight magnesium wheels.

Mercedes made it a point to cut weight wherever possible. It chopped out excess material and used 3D-printed parts.

As a result, the EQXX weighs around 3,800 pounds, about a ton less than Mercedes' EQS sedan.

The company also developed a new battery pack and drivetrain to optimize efficiency.

Since the EQXX is geared more toward long road trips than track days, it makes relatively little power -- just 200 horses.

Solar panels integrated into the EQXX's roof can add up to 25 kilometers (about 15 miles) of range under ideal weather conditions, Mercedes says.

It wouldn't be a Benz if it didn't have a luxurious cabin.

But the EQXX's interior, just like the rest of the car, is all about efficiency.

Mercedes filled the cabin with sustainable materials that it says lower the car's overall carbon footprint.

The door pulls are made from a vegan silk-like material, the company says.

The EQXX also sports vegan leathers made from mushrooms and cacti, according to Mercedes.

Some surfaces are made from recycled plastic bottles.

The Vision EQXX also offers a sneak peek at the future of Mercedes' in-car screens. The concept has a single massive display that stretches 47.5 inches across the dashboard.

We already knew Mercedes is getting serious about electric cars. The EQXX concept is yet another sign of what's to come in the automaker's battery-powered future.","{'uri': 'news.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}",[],https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hSRlvOL.bRsTUa5b6V18hQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7CKOxRf9fS0pAALGurda0A--~B/aD0yNTc0O3c9MzQzMzthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/3b869e14752b0039787eb490636b8b9b,0.1686274509803922,eng-7380045,False,0.843137264251709,0.1686274509803922,378943380,1

The aerodynamic EQXX packs a similar-size battery as Mercedes' current, full-size production EQS sedan into a compact chassis about the size of the entry-level, gas-powered Mercedes CLA Class. Introduced ahead of this week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, EQXX is also stuffed with a full-dash infotainment screen and virtuous, sustainable materials prized by green customers.

Mercedes announced that, when the concept hits the road this spring, it will be capable of 620 miles of range -- a trip from Detroit to New York City. That figure rivals that of gas-electric hybrids like the 633-mile-range Toyota Prius, though it comes up short of diesel-powered marathoners like the 1,000-mile-range Ram 1500 pickup.

The Merc follows in the footsteps of other European moon shots like the 2002 Volkswagen 1-Liter concept, a similarly sleek, cigar-shaped, diesel-powered creation that achieved the European benchmark of using just one liter of petrol to travel 100 kilometers -- the equivalent of 237 mpg.

For the EV Age, Mercedes says its concept will hit a new efficiency target of less than 10 kWh consumed per 100 kilometers traveled (6 miles per kWh).

The VW diesel appeared at a time when Middle East conflict dominated headlines and Europe was determined to free itself of Mideast oil by encouraging the adoption of efficient, diesel-powered autos. Diesels have since fallen out of favor with governments. EVs are the new political fashion and EQXX claims the moral high ground as governments force non-fossil fuel vehicles.

""The Mercedes-Benz EQXX is how we imagine the future of electric cars,"" said Mercedes Chairman Ola Källenius. ""The EQXX is an advanced car in so many dimensions -- and it even looks stunning and futuristic. With that, it underlines where our entire company is headed: We will build the world's most desirable electric cars.""

The EQXX achieves its efficiency goals with a low frontal area and a long, race car-like tail. The Merc boasts a drag co-efficient of just 0.17 -- lower than state-of-the-art production cars like Lucid Air's 0.20 and Tesla Model S Plaid's 0.208. The low drag co-efficient is achieved with a smaller frontal area than the entry-level, Mercedes CLA-class and a rear track width 2 inches less than at the front.

The concept's range numbers are better than the brand's current, $103,360 EQS production EV halo, which gets 350 miles of range. In packing a similar 100 kWh battery into a compact-class chassis, EQXX claims 95% driveline efficiency compared with 75% for the EQS. Drawing on its experience in Formula One and Formula E racing -- both of which utilize battery technology -- the Vision concept claims 50% less volume and 30% less weight than the EQS battery.

The lightweight battery means the Mercedes tips the scale at 3,858 pounds -- or about the same girth as a Tesla Model 3 that has nearly half the range. A solar roof on EQXX delivers another 16 miles of potential mileage.

""Driven by the idea of zero impact on our planet and a highly responsible use of green energy, we encouraged our engineers to go above and beyond,"" reads the EQXX news release. ""The VISION EQXX is the result of a mission we set to break through technological barriers and lift energy efficiency to new heights. It answers the progressive demands of a modern generation of customer.""

But Mercedes' push toward electrification is driven by more than political virtue signaling. Long dominant in the U.S. market, Germany's Teutonic trio of Mercedes, BMW and Audi have been passed by the Model 3, which recorded more than 200,000 unit sales in 2020, compared with just 52,000 for Mercedes' best-selling GLC-class sport utility. As EV mandates accelerate in the next few years, Tesla is in the catbird seat, accounting for about 80% of EV sales in the U.S.

Tesla also has redefined auto interiors with its simple, big-screen tablet technology. EQXX takes that to another level with a 47.5-inch screen that stretches from A-pillar to A-pillar. It includes 3D navigation.

""Marking the launch of a new, super-purist design style, the EQXX represents a new expression of efficiency in interior design,"" says the Mercedes press release, echoing Tesla. ""In a departure from the conventional design approach, the interior layout focuses on just a few modules and the beautiful simplicity of lightweight design.""

The design includes vegan leather seats made from mycelium, adapted from the rootlike structure of mushrooms. Carpets are made from bamboo fiber, and the rear floor from landfill items like mixed plastics, cardboard, even baby diapers.

The chassis is based on a 900-volt architecture for quicker charging and a heat pump is integrated to keep cold-weather battery losses to a minimum in, for example, frigid Michigan winters.

""By making efficiency the new currency, Mercedes-Benz has created ... luxury and convenience with less impact on nature, and more electric mobility with less waste,"" says the Mercedes press release.","{'uri': 'detroitnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Detroit News'}",[],"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/01/03/PDTN/96767b7a-653f-450a-8361-a5c598de1194-2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-064-source.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1641,923,x199,y610&format=pjpg&width=1200",0.419607843137255,eng-7380045,False,0.772549033164978,0.419607843137255,378942960,1

We're only one trading day into 2022, but so far, that's definitely not the case. Yesterday, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported that it had surpassed expectations for deliveries in the final quarter of 2021, leading its stock to start the year with a bang. Tesla closed up 13.5%, and thanks to its momentum, several smaller EV stocks rallied higher as well.

But why should investors care about one day of gains?

As we have previously noted, many analysts forecast a grim 2022, citing supply chain concerns and other manufacturing difficulties. While it's true that the stalling of the Build Back Better Act may cost the sector some growth, that doesn't mean that the demand for electric vehicles is going to disappear. The green energy boom is still very much upon us and consumers are still seeking to transition to sustainable transportation options.

Investors should also note that Tesla demonstrated record-breaking delivery figures while the chip shortage posed constraints to its sector. While Tesla's peers are smaller, they are also newer and are taking steps to stay competitive. Proterra is venturing into the battery production space and one industry expert has predicted that the by mid-2022, the Lucid Air may be the ""best car in the world.""

Canoo is primed to start producing its futuristic vehicles, which are perfect for capturing the fascination of auto buffs, on American soil. Fisker is also gearing up to launch its Ocean SUV.

InvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango recently advised investors not to ""just sit back"" while EV stocks break out in 2022. The way it looks from here, investors would be wise to heed this advice. The EV race isn't showing any signs of slowing down so far and companies seem as determined as ever to overtake their peers and pull into the lead.

As long as Tesla stock continues to rise, its momentum is likely to carry other EV stocks along with it. All investors should be watching keenly as automakers continue to make progress and help move transportation forward.","{'uri': 'investorplace.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'InvestorPlace'}",[],https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ev-battery.jpg,0.2078431372549019,eng-7378627,False,0.4627451002597809,0.2078431372549019,378942480,1

Over the course of a varied career, he has also been a radio newscaster, an investment banker, and a bass player in a selection of rock and roll bands. A native New Yorker, he currently lives in Los Angeles.

Shares of electric vehicle (EV) company Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) were off to an electric start for 2022. On the year's first trading day Monday, the stock closed 8.7% higher, although the company did not report any fresh news. Rather, it was a highly encouraging development from a peer that seemed to put the zip in Lordstown shares.

That peer is the No. 1 company in the EV automobile space, the almighty Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). On Monday, Tesla reported 308,600 vehicle deliveries in the fourth quarter, a new record high for the popular company. This was quite the upside surprise, as collectively analysts were forecasting the number would be a mere 263,000.

While Tesla is an exceptional business in many respects, this estimates-busting figure clearly illustrates the heavy and enduring demand for EVs from the public. Hence the coattail effect seen with Lordstown and other next-generation auto stocks on the day (such as fellow EV truck maker Lucid Group and China's Nio, both of which also saw notable share price acceleration).

There are numerous concerns with Lordstown as a business, however. The company is still haunted by a scathing report published last March by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research alleging it was not being honest about its operations.

Among other accusations, Hindenburg said Lordstown was inflating the volume of preorders for its Endurance pickup truck, and being overly optimistic about the start date of Endurance's production.

Compounding that, in July it was revealed that the Department of Justice had opened an investigation into the company.

Since then, Lordstown reached a deal to sell its one and only factory to global electronics manufacturer Foxconn (which, it seems, will be the entity actually producing the Endurance). But the truck has still not rolled off the factory floor, while EV sector peers -- particularly Lucid -- already have models on the market.

Given these factors, then, we shouldn't expect Lordstown's stock price rally to last very long.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'eric_volkman@fool.com', 'name': 'Eric Volkman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659747/car-view-of-driving-down-the-road.jpg,0.1294117647058823,,False,0,0.1294117647058823,378942000,3

Shares of luxury electric car maker Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) soared the first trading day of 2022, gaining as much as 9.2% as of 2:45 p.m. ET Jan. 3. Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) are exploding, and that's propping stocks higher across the board. Lucid, fresh off a strong analyst rating that's already boosted expectations for investors, couldn't be left far behind.

Leading EV makers just announced their latest monthly delivery numbers, but none could come even close to Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) performance. Tesla didn't just deliver a record number of 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter but crushed analysts' estimates by a huge margin. The numbers coming in from the world's largest EV market, China, are equally impressive. Nio, for example, reported a 50% growth in its deliveries for the month of December, while XPeng and Li Auto reported nearly 180% and 130% jumps in December deliveries, respectively.

These numbers don't just confirm how hot global demand for EVs is but also put to rest concerns about the lingering global semiconductor chip shortage that proved to be the biggest hurdle for the auto industry in 2021.

Lucid, on its part, started delivering its first car, the luxury sedan Lucid Air Dream Edition, only in late October and isn't expected to report monthly numbers yet. Lucid is also considered to be one of the biggest threats to Tesla given its Tesla-beating range rating; so expectations are running even higher what with Tesla reporting blowout sales numbers. Lucid Air Dream has won rave reviews over the past couple of months, with yet another coming in this morning of January 3: Green Car Reports has named Lucid Air as the best car to buy in 2022.

Barely days ago, Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli resumed coverage of Lucid stock and gave it a price target of $57 a share based on Lucid's powerful EV technology and best-in-class range rating, among other things.

Lucid stock crashed in the month of December after a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rattled investors even as the company remained silent on the number of Air Dream cars it had delivered since October 30. Citi's fresh price target that represented nearly 46% upside from the stock's previous day's closing price and the bumper sales numbers from leading EV makers, therefore, acted as the perfect catalysts for EV bulls to bet on Lucid stock before it takes off to be one of the hottest growth stocks in 2022.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'neha_chamaria@fool.com', 'name': 'Neha Chamaria', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659739/lucid-air-exterior-07.jpg,0.2784313725490195,eng-7381244,False,0.8078431487083435,0.2784313725490195,378941940,20

Tesla said its delivery count should be viewed as ""slightly conservative,"" for a vehicle is not considered delivered until it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by around 0.5%, according to the EV maker.

Detained Tunisian ex-justice minister Noureddine Bhiri of the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, who is refusing food or medication after his transfer to hospital, is suspected of ""terrorism"", the interior minister said Monday.

Bhiri, deputy president of Ennahdha - viewed by President Kais Saied as an enemy - was arrested by plainclothes officers Friday and his whereabouts were initially unknown.

Ennahdha had played a central role in Tunisian politics until a power grab by President Kais Saied last year.

Tunisia was the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago, but civil society groups and Saied's opponents have expressed fear of a slide back to authoritarianism a decade after the revolution that toppled longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

""There were fears of acts of terrorism targeting the country's security and we had to act,"" Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine said late Monday of the arrest.

A member of a delegation that visited Bhiri in hospital told AFP on Monday that he was refusing food or medication.

On Sunday activists and a former Ennahdha legislator said Bhiri was in a critical condition and facing death.

But the source told AFP that Bhiri, 63, is ""not in critical condition for the time being"".

The source, asking not to be named, said that a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the United Nations rights commission visited Bhiri at hospital in the northern town of Bizerte on Sunday.

He is ""lively and lucid"", and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward.

Since Friday, however, Bhiri has ""refused to take any food or medication, prompting his transfer to hospital"" two days later, the source said.

Samir Dilou, a lawyer and ex-Ennahdha MP, condemned Bhiri's arrest as ""political"" and an abuse of the justice system.

He told a Tunis news conference that he is lodging a ""kidnapping"" charge against Saied and the interior minister Charfeddine.

The interior minister said late Monday that evidence had been sent to the justice ministry regarding Bhiri's activities, but that the prosecution ""delayed"" action on the matter.

This, Charfeddine said, prompted him to ""quickly apply... judicial control"" over Bhiri, in a context where he was suspected of ""falsifying"" identity papers, including for a Syrian woman.

The interior minister said he had ""personally verified"" that the detainee was being ""treated well"".

Bhiri's wife, Saida Akremi, also a lawyer, told reporters he had suffered ""a heart attack"", and that she was being denied access to him because she refused to sign documents as demanded by security services.

Mondher Ounissi, a doctor and member of Ennahdha's executive bureau, said Sunday that Bhiri suffers from several chronic illnesses, including diabetes and hypertension.

He has been ""deprived of his medication"" and ""his life is threatened"", Ounissi said, adding that Bhiri usually takes 16 pills a day.

The interior ministry on Friday said that two individuals had been ordered under house arrest, without identifying them.

It said the move was a ""preventive measure dictated by the need to preserve national security"".

The anti-torture group INPT has identified the second person detained as Fathi Baldi, a former interior ministry official.

The president ""bears full responsibility for the life of Mr Bhiri"", the anti-Saied group ""Citizens against the coup"" said Sunday on Twitter.

It said he had been ""rushed to the hospital in a very serious condition"".

Saied on July 25 sacked the Ennahdha-supported government and suspended parliament, presenting himself as the ultimate interpreter of the constitution.

He later took steps to rule by decree, and in early December vowed to press on with reforms to the political system.","{'uri': 'english.alaraby.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'alaraby'}",[],https://english.alaraby.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/600x338/public/1234231206.jpeg?h=d1fae474&itok=-f6eXLb5,-0.3254901960784313,eng-7377822,False,0.8941176533699036,-0.3254901960784313,378941100,1

Automakers have spent the past year announcing plans for electric vehicle models and production facilities. That makes 2022 a year when growing numbers of consumers will be weighing whether it's time to buy their first EV. Is it worth taking the plunge?

That probably depends on the price point and market segment you're considering. My view is that the higher your price point, the more you should think about buying an EV now rather than waiting another couple years. Here's a couple reasons why: First, automakers are launching their higher-end models before down-market ones, so the selection is better at the top end. There's also the tricky proposition of thinking through residual values for used vehicles in the future -- demand for gasoline-powered cars will be shrinking, so buying a new one now means it will be worth a lot less by the time you're ready to trade up.

It's important to keep in mind that much of consumer behavior stems from automakers' actions. Manufacturers have gotten the message from investors that they'll be rewarded for accelerating the transition to electrics, while profits from gasoline-powered vehicles will serve mostly to fund those investments. The major automakers, following Tesla Inc.'s lead, are starting with higher-end models both because that's where consumer demand is strongest and because it's easier to be profitable at higher price points while sales volumes remain far below gasoline vehicles.

Adding to temptation for consumers, industry tastemakers are giving these new, pricey EV models high marks. MotorTrend magazine named Rivian's $74,000 R1T its truck of the year, and the even more expensive Lucid Air its car of the year. Both vehicles recently started consumer deliveries and have lengthy waiting lists.

Maybe you're impressed by what you've seen so far, but would rather wait a little longer until EV infrastructure like charging stations are more built out. But the value calculation for buying any new vehicle includes what it will be worth years later when you're ready to trade it in or sell it. The average length of time drivers hold onto new vehicles is 6 years. So if you're buying a new vehicle in 2022, you should be thinking about the market for used cars in 2028 or later.

The demographics of electric vehicle owners look a lot like Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk: on average, male, 40 to 55 years old, with an annual household income of more than $100,000. My colleague Nat Bullard recently posted some additional tables on EV buyer demographics. The percentage of new vehicles sold in the U.S. that are electrics in 2022 might still be in the single digits, but for this demographic it will be well above that.

Looking out to 2028, when the overall market share of EVs in the U.S. might be as high as 30%, the majority of affluent younger and middle-aged consumers might be purchasing electric cars and trucks. That's going to have a big impact on the value of used, gasoline-powered vehicles, with fewer buyers in every passing year.

While there might still be a robust market for used Honda Accords in 2028, it will probably be a more tenuous market for used gasoline-powered $40,000 sedans and sport utility vehicles as people in that segment switch over to EVs.

Meanwhile, though it's still early in its vehicle history, the market for used Tesla Model 3's has been robust. The cumulative impact of advertising campaigns shouldn't be overlooked either. Automakers aren't investing tens of billions of dollars into EVs only to have them sit in factories and dealer lots. They'll also use ad campaigns to make consumers believe that they're tech savvy, forward-thinking companies. By 2028, automakers will want affluent vehicle buyers to believe that gasoline-powered cars are as cool as floppy disks or having a landline -- the kind of thing your grandpa still has in his house.

What about cost? In a recent research note, Goldman Sachs pointed out that some segments of the EV market are already cost-competitive versus gasoline-powered vehicles after fuel and maintenance costs are factored in. Savings worked out to around $1,000 a year using a gasoline price per gallon of around $3, so buying a $60,000 EV breaks even compared with a $55,000 gasoline-powered vehicle after about five years.

And that's before taking tax incentives into account. It's hard to make a generalized point here because different states have different incentive levels, and at the national level an automaker like Tesla has used up its allotment of incentives while other automakers that haven't sold as many EVs to date still have some available. The proposed Build Back Better Act, currently stalled in the Senate, could include new incentives of $7,500 a vehicle or more, but we'll have to see in the new year whether that line item or the legislation as a whole becomes law. Still, even a scaled-down version of that proposal would make the financial rationale for buying an EV now much stronger.

A fair concern to have is the uncertainty surrounding the longevity and standards of the batteries that power electrics. Batteries do degrade somewhat over time -- a Tesla Model S battery loses 5% of its charging capacity after its first 50,000 miles -- but EV batteries are estimated to last between 10 and 20 years before needing to be replaced.

It's also possible that technological breakthroughs will lead to a fundamentally different kind of battery powering vehicles in the future. On some level it's weighing the uncertainty of changes in batteries against the certainty that the market for gasoline-powered vehicles will decline perpetually.

For utilitarian, budget-conscious car buyers, there's still reason to be confident that a new gasoline-powered vehicle bought in 2022 will retain a decent value in the used market towards the end of the decade. But for affluent consumers, it's less of a sure thing. Those high-end buyers who are thinking about waiting a little while longer to make their next vehicle an EV should consider going ahead with it in the new year.

The stock is up 12% on Jan. 3 following a Jan. 2 announcement that fourth-quarter deliveries amounted to 308,600 electric cars and full-year deliveries amounted to 936,172 vehicles. ""Thank you to all of our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and supporters who helped us achieve a great year,"" the company said in a release.

Mercedes-Benz unveiled its Vision EQXX concept vehicle during a virtual presentation at CES 2022, and yeah, this thing lives up to the hype. Not only does the EQXX feature an obscene 648-mile range, but it's the most efficient EV ever made -- it can travel over 60 miles (around 100 kilometers) using just 10kWh of energy.

For reference, 10kWh of home electrical usage costs around $12 in most parts of the United States. It's about as much electricity you'd use to run an A/C unit for three hours. And if a fairy godmother came down and turned the Vision EQXX into a gas guzzler, it would have an insane 235 MPG fuel efficiency.

Again, the EQXX gets its range through efficiency, not a XXL double-stuffed battery. That means improved aerodynamics (a record-breaking drag coefficient of 0.17), an advanced drivetrain developed with help from F1 engineers, and a relatively lightweight build (3,858 pounds). I should note that the EQXX has 117 solar cells on its roof, though, and its battery is much more power-dense (and therefore physically smaller) than other 100kWh batteries.

Mercedes-Benz also managed to give the EQXX a very strange, futuristic interior. It features a 56-inch Hyperscreen that spans the width of the dashboard, plus ""leather"" seats made of mushrooms and environmentally-friendly pull tabs instead of door handles.

But there are a few things to note about the Vision EQXX that aren't so exciting. For one, it's just a concept car, and there's no telling how much a production EQXX would cost -- these ultra-efficient EVs may not be accessible to regular people for a very long time. Additionally, the EQXX's 648-mile range isn't confirmed by the EPA or any other independent parties.

And if buyers want an EV with a super long range today, Mercedes isn't necessarily the best option. The Mercedes-Benz EQS can travel 350 miles on a charge, which is pretty good, but the Lucid Air and Tesla Model S Long Range Plus can go between 400 and 500 miles. Also, Tesla plans to launch the Roadster in 2023, and it can go 620 miles on a charge -- although I have a feeling it'll get delayed.","{'uri': 'reviewgeek.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'reviewgeek.com'}",[],"https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2022/01/b9153260.png?width=600&height=340&fit=crop&trim=2,2,2,2",0.2470588235294118,eng-7380045,False,0.7098039388656616,0.2470588235294118,378938400,1

The current king of range in electric vehicles is Lucid Air which can drive 520 miles (837 km) in a single charge. Today, Mercedes-Benz claims to have broken the record with a 1000 km (621 km) per charge sedan which is yet to be rated officially by the USA's EPA or the European equivalent. Meet the Vision EQXX concept, the car that achieves this amazing engineering feat.

With this kind of range, the EQXX can theoretically drive from from Berlin, Germany, to Paris, France, without needing to plug in. Mercedes claims the average American driver would only need to recharge the sedan twice a month. The automaker had to design the whole car from scratch in just 18 months with one goal : efficiency. A lot of technologies and tweaks went into the sedan to achieve this kind of range without using an extra large battery.

The Concept car has an ultra-low drag coefficient of just 0.18. The body is smooth and has a teardrop shape running from the roof to the tail. The body is ultra slippery to slice through the air with ease. There are also wheel covers for better aerodynamics. The rear incorporates a diffuser that deploys at high speeds but fits seamlessly into the body when not in use.

Mercedes didn't want to simply slap a huge battery into the car to give it more range, that would make it more expensive to produce and also add unnecessary weight. The battery and the frame that carries it weighs around 1,091 pounds (495 kilograms). Exact battery details were not revealed, but they said it is less than 100 kilowatt-hours. The pack also has 50 percent less volume and is 30 percent lighter than the one in the EQS sedan they launched a while ago. The total mass of the sedan is 3858 pound (1749 kgs) which is lighter than the long range version of the Tesla Model 3 (4,072 lb or 1,847 kg).

The EQXX has a solar panel roof option that can add 15 miles (25 km) of range, however, charge from the panel will be stored in a separate battery and will mostly be used to power the car's blower fan, lights, infotainment, and other ancillaries effectively saving the juice from the main battery pack which in turn adds the extra range.

Powering the concept car will be a single motor which outputs 201 horsepower. Mercedes claims that the powertrain is so efficient that 95 percent of the energy ends up at the wheels.

Speaking of wheels, they were made in partnership with Bridgestone to make them have ultra low rolling resistance which further increases efficiency.

The sedan has a length of roughly 182.3 inches (463 centimeters) and a wheelbase of 110.2 inches (280 centimeters). For comparison, the latest C-Class is 187 inches (475 centimeters long) and rides on a 112.8-inch (286.51-centimeter) wheelbase.

Inside the EQXX is a huge one piece curved screen that spans 47.5 inches (120.6 centimeters) from the drivers side to the front passengers end. It has an 8k resolution and runs a navigation system with 3d graphics.

Ambient lights strips are present too like in the EQS and the S Class. The seats and interior elements are made using sustainable materials such as vegan leather that comes from mushrooms, animal-free leather from pulverized cactus fibers, and bamboo-based carpets.

Should it come to fruition and live up to that promise, the Vision EQXX would beat the range of the Lucid Air Dream Edition by more than 100 miles and the Tesla Model S Long Range Plus by around 220 miles.

""The Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX is how we imagine the future of electric cars,"" Mercedes-Benz head Ola Källenius said.

Based on the automaker's simulations, the Vision EQXX would use less than 10 kWh to travel 62 miles on public roads, delivering an efficiency of more than 6 miles per kWh. Converted into fossil fuel consumption, Mercedes says that's around the ""golden figure"" of 1 liter of gasoline per 62 miles.

The battery is half the size of and 30 percent lighter than the one in the EQS. However, it still has a capacity of almost 100 kWh. What's more, there are ultra-thin solar panels on the roof that can add up to 25 km (15.5 miles) of range.

The Vision EQXX is a lightweight car (1,750 kg or 3,858 lbs) that has been aerodynamically optimized. The automaker says that, with a drag coefficient of cd 0.17, the EV is more aerodynamic than a football (which has a cd of 0.18 to 0.2). What's more, Mercedes claims that 95 percent of battery energy is directed to the wheels.

Teams from Mercedes' research and development centers worked with its Formula 1 and Formula E engineers on the concept. They harnessed digital tools to reduce waste and weight by cutting out excess material -- the wheels are made with magnesium and the brake discs are built with aluminum alloy. The Vision EQXX uses recycled and plant-based materials too.

As for the interior, the Vision EQXX's infotainment system has a single 47.5-inch, mini-LED 8K screen. Like the Hyperscreen in the EQS, it spans almost the entire width of the cabin, though this is a one-piece display. The automaker worked with NAVIS Automotive Systems on a navigation system with zoom and scroll functions that include a satellite view. The ""Hey Mercedes"" voice assistant is integrated into the infotainment system too.

Even if Mercedes doesn't bring the Vision EQXX to show floors, developing the stylish concept has proven a valuable endeavor. It's already integrating many of the EV's features and developments into production. Some are being used in the next generation of the Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture for compact and medium-sized cars.","{'uri': 'finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

Theoretically, of course.The single-motor, most likely rear-wheel-drive EQXX boasts virtuous features such as vegan leather, solar panels, recycled-plastic trim -- and an extremely slick 0.17 drag coefficient.

While automakers revealing futuristic EV concepts tend to prioritize promises of performance over range, Mercedes is reversing that equation with the Vision EQXX. The compact four-door has been unveiled as part of the CES technology show in Las Vegas, and although the claimed power output is a relatively modest 201 horsepower, the company promises that the car has been designed to be able to deliver more than 620 miles (1000 km) of real-world driving on a single charge. But that big claim has the typical concept-car squishiness to it, as it isn't comparable to the range figure of any other EV. It's not a number from the WLTP test cycle used in Europe nor is it a U.S. EPA range figure, but instead what Mercedes describes as the result of ""digital simulations based in real-life traffic conditions."" Whether it might beat the Lucid Air Dream's impressive 520-mile EPA rating is anyone's guess.

The EQXX looks production viable -- even having the door mirrors that the zanier future-looking concepts increasingly do without -- but the car seems to be hinting at next-generation advances rather than offering a solid promise. This concept, the company says, will act as a ""technology blueprint for series production.""

© Mercedes-Benz Mercedes-Benz EQXX Concept

Mercedes has only released limited technical details, but it is clear that the EQXX is short and svelte by the brand's standards. There is no word on overall length, but confirmation of a 110.0-inch wheelbase suggests it will be a little longer than the A-class sedan, which has 107.4 inches between its axles and a shorter rear overhang. We don't have a width figure, but the head-on view makes it clear that the EQXX is also much narrower than an average Benz, and also that the rear track is two inches narrower than the front, with the ultra-slippery shape responsible for a claimed drag coefficient of just 0.17.

© Mercedes-Benz Mercedes-Benz EQXX Concept 202 MPG?

Aerodynamic considerations have clearly dictated much else of the EQXX's sleek form, especially the long, shallow angle of the falling roofline and the retro droop of the rear fenders, also the way the bodywork tucks in beneath the full-width lighting element at the back above an active, deployable diffuser that motors out at speed. The outline of the trunklid confirms that the Mercedes vision of the future is also a sedan rather than a hatchback or SUV, which is also pleasingly old-fashioned.

The wind-cheating shape plays a large part in Mercedes's claimed powertrain efficiency, with the official release saying the car can travel six miles on just 1.0 kWh of electrical energy, a figure equivalent to a combustion car capable of 202 mpg (which is close to the efficiency that Mercedes describes as ""the golden figure of one liter per 100 kilometers""). The comparison is complicated by the fact that, according to Mercedes, the EQXX's driveline is 95 percent efficient. That means only 5 percent of the energy put into the battery pack fails to make it to the road. Even the most efficient gasoline engines struggle to do better than 35 percent. This is why the EQXX can put up a big range number without a massive battery pack, Mercedes claiming that EQXX has slightly less than 100 kWh of usable capacity, about as much energy as three gallons of regular unleaded gas, but the car is able to turn much more of this into movement. The company is also very proud of the underfloor battery's compact size and relatively modest weight, which is 50 percent smaller and 30 percent lighter than the 107.8-kWh pack in the EQS.

A 900-Volt Battery Pack

The pack was developed jointly with AMG's High Performance Powertrains division in the U.K., which creates Mercedes F1 engines as well as the almost equally exotic powerplant for the long delayed (but nearly here) AMG One. This operates at a high 900 volts and uses what are described as high silicon anodes capable of holding more energy than lesser cells, with a compact design allowing the same housing to accommodate electronic control gear. The battery's total weight, 1091 pounds, is impressively light given the pack's capacity, with the car's claimed overall mass of 3858 pounds being only slightly higher than that of a standard-range Tesla Model 3.

Strangely, there is no official word on the other side of the powertrain beyond apparent confirmation that the EQXX uses a single motor; we haven't even been told which axle is powered, although the rear seems much more likely. Mercedes does say that the concept features an underfloor cooling plate for aerodynamic efficiency, active air flaps to channel cooling air, and a heat pump to help heat the cabin. It also features solar panels, although the claimed ability of these to add up to 15 miles of range on a sunny day doesn't come from directly charging the high-voltage battery but rather by using the energy created to operate the car's blower fan, lights, infotainment, and other ancillaries.

© Mercedes-Benz Mercedes-Benz EQXX Concept The Now Inevitable Wide Infotainment Screen

The EQXX's cabin is dominated by what seems the inevitable conclusion of modern UI design -- an LED screen that runs across the full width of the dashboard, unbroken by vertical seams. This is 47.5 inches wide and offers 8K resolution with a 7680-by-660-pixel display that will require some substantial graphical firepower to operate. It certainly looks crisp in the pictures. The official release also enthuses that ""a star-cloud avatar, reminiscent of our namesake, Mercedes Jellinek, is the ethereal guide. Shape-shifting in response to the driver's needs and taking care of the passengers, she makes the journey into a luxury experience."" But we have absolutely no idea what that means.

Inside, something close to a full set of sustainability boxes is checked off. For instance, there are two types of vegan leather, one made from the root structure of mushrooms and the other derived from cactus fibers in a ""bio-based polyurethane matrix."" There are carpets made from bamboo, and there's trim that incorporates recycled plastics woven into a shimmering fabric. The exterior bodywork is made from what is described as low-CO2 steel made from scrap, with doors made from carbon fiber and glass-reinforced plastics.

The EQXX's efficient minimalism is strongly reminiscent of another future-looking German prototype: the similarly slippery XL1 diesel plug-in hybrid that Volkswagen put into very limited production in Europe in 2013. The Mercedes's four seats and four doors make it more practical, and it weighs more than twice as much, but the front end design is strikingly similar. It will be interesting to see how much of the EQXX's thinking translates into future production models.

The party game, titled ""Dr. Hallard's End of the World Party"", involves five rounds of voting on a group of three codes to be dialed into the ""dream transmission device"". Once all three codes are successfully found and voted on, that team wins and the device triggers a special message from Dr. Hallard herself while activating the ""lucid dream frequency"".

The original goal was to build a ""mysterious looking device"" that allowed players to enter in codes that were found through a series of puzzle hunts and interactive social gameplay. The box would give feedback on what kind of code it was as well as be programed to have two different endings or outcomes depending on which team won. I decided it would be easier to build a box out of the shell of some old vintage electronic that ideally featured dials and switches built in. After many lost ebay bids, i came upon a broken vintage National NC-33 Ham Radio from 1948. The rest of the work was retro fitting it. See project log for more details on the build.

You will outshine your colleagues in whatever you choose to do. But your expectations may far exceed the outcome. Ganesha asks that you have patience. Results take time.

Taurus : Planning your own milestones and celebrating the success of friends is the agenda for the day. Your thoughts will be progressive in business or at work, and any plans you make will make a rock-solid foundation for your future. Social gatherings and parties will beckon with bubbly and bruschetta.

Gemini : Today will prove to be an emotional and engaging day for you, predicts Ganesha. Fortune will favour you, though your emotions may cloud your reasoning and slow down your progress. Your spare time will be spent on devising methods to make the best use of your knowledge.

Cancer : Today, you will use money to fulfil your needs. If there is anything that according to you needs changing, you will throw some money to get it changed. Your loved ones will celebrate your financial gains and spend some more of it in the process. If there has been any limit to the amount of money flowing in, there is certainly no limit to the money leaving your coffers.

Leo : Maybe it is the weather, or just one of those days, but today, you are extremely prone to wild mood swings, says Ganesha. You must remember that nothing is permanent, except change. So go with the flow and do not get caught in the undercurrent of the changes that are taking place all around you. Take it as a warning that works to your advantage, says Ganesha. All the worrying and sorting out done, do not forget to sit back and relax -- you deserve it more than anybody.

Virgo : Today, your ingenuity will breed ideas like rabbits. You have the healer's hands, and so shall you make right many a wrong, predicts Ganesha. You shall be most understanding, and reading people's mind will do wonders for you and your beloved.

Libra : Love is in the air, and passion lurks right around the corner. So keep your eyes and ears open, because you may soon find yourself entrapped in a passionate love episode. But the price of new love is always steep, and your beloved may burn a hole in your pocket. Still, with someone like that, you are always assured of getting good value for your money! So bring on the champagne and the caviar! Ganesha wishes you a splendid time ahead.

Scorpio : You shall groom yourself all prim and proper today. The thought of how you look dominates your mind today. You are likely to capture the imagination of people - both at work and at social gathering. Cash will exit left, right and centre from your pockets on account of fun and entertainment.

Sagittarius : Dark and gloomy shall be your temperament for most part of the day today. But the afternoon may just see the skies clearing. The apparent mood change, says Ganesha; will mainly be because of good news from abroad and business profits from your partner.

Capricorn : Certain revelations about a relationship will draw your attention; you will find it intriguing and will spend a good amount of time trying to solve the mystery, says Ganesha. Besides, your impressive communication power will help dissolve conflicts that may have risen because of misinterpretation. There is nothing really to worry about, but keeping abreast of the activities of your rivals will help you stay ahead in competition.

Aquarius : Your communication skills will work wonders today. Your eloquence will win you precious brownie points, and may prove highly beneficial in meetings. In fact, all your arguments will sound very persuasive. The trick is not to get ruffled, says Ganesha, when people don't agree with you.

Pisces : You are unlikely to be your calm and lucid self today. You will likely catch yourself worrying unnecessarily and putting in more efforts than required at work. However, some leisure time will come your way in the evening wherein you will regain your usual perspective, says Ganesha.","{'uri': 'dailyexcelsior.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Jammu Kashmir Latest News | Tourism | Breaking News J&K'}","[{'uri': 'daily_excelsior@dailyexcelsior.com', 'name': 'Daily Excelsior', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dailyexcelsior.jpg,0.3176470588235294,,False,0,0.3176470588235294,378933180,1

This is enough to get Vision EQ XX from New York City to Cincinnati, Berlin to Paris, or Beijing to Nanjing on a single charge. And it's impressive in contrast to other long-distance EVs currently on the road, such as the Lucid Air (520 miles) and the Tesla Model S Long Range Plus (402 miles). However, unlike these vehicles, the Vision EQ XX is just a concept and there is no concrete production plan. (At this point.)

Sporty intent and sophisticated futuristic design

Mercedes, who had been teasing the vehicle for a few weeks, finally announced it (in effect) at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. (Like most major companies, Mercedes has canceled plans to participate directly in CES as cases of COVID-19 increase.)

With its sporty intent and sophisticated futuristic design, the Vision EQ XX can serve as the basis for production vehicles that may be comparable to other luxury EVs such as the Porsche Taycan, Audi E-tron GT and Tesla Roadster. There is sex.

Unlike other Mercedes concepts, Vision EQ XX should actually be more grounded. The company claims to consume energy at speeds of 10kWh per 100km, or more than 6 miles per kWh, based on range estimates based on simulations of real-world traffic conditions. In terms of fossil fuel consumption, this is equivalent to the golden figure of 235 miles per gallon, or 1 liter of gasoline per 100 km, in the United States.

To get an overview of this, Mercedes states that 10kWh is equivalent to using a tumble dryer or air conditioner unit for 3 hours or watching TV for 50 hours on a 50-inch LED screen.

However, despite these simulations and estimates, Mercedes has a perfectly realistic range of Vision EQ XX, and much of its technological advances will be integrated into future production vehicles through the Mercedes-Benz modular architecture. It states.

The result is a masterpiece of efficiency

Mercedes says it achieved this energy efficiency by pulling rather than stuffing an oversized battery under the car floor[ing] Drivetrain efficiency, energy density, aerodynamics, lightweight design all stop ... the result is a masterpiece of efficiency.

Lightweight is certainly one way to represent a vehicle with a total weight of 1,750 kg (3,858 lbs) and falls into the category of compact SUVs rather than sports cars. Most of its weight is probably in the battery pack, which holds nearly 100 kWh of energy, but records 50% less volume and 30% less mass than the Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan. The slippery teardrop shape is intended to reduce aerodynamic resistance. Mercedes claims a benchmark coefficient of 0.17 based on a 140km / h wind tunnel test, surpassing the EQS record 0.20 drag coefficient.

Grid view

Of course, the range estimate is exactly that: Estimate. It is the responsibility of the US Environmental Protection Agency and Europe's Global Harmonized Light Vehicle Testing Procedures (WLTP) to individually certify EV ranges. Most electric vehicles on the market today have a range of 200 to 300 miles, but some earlier models are shorter. The latest harvest of EV has a range of 250-300 miles.

Of course, the EV range is very subjective. Even the EPA rating system is only intended to present snapshots under certain conditions of the institution's testing process. Factors such as steep climbing and the effects of the cold are usually excluded. These factors can drain the vehicle's battery much faster than when driving on flat roads or in warm weather.

Vision EQXX will get some help from 117 solar cells mounted on the roof of the vehicle. Developed in collaboration with Europe's largest solar energy laboratory, the solar roof aims to offset the energy consumption of high voltage systems while expanding their reach. According to Mercedes, solar cells can add up to 25km in long-distance relationships under ideal conditions in one day.

For now, you need to understand their words well. Using solar cells to power an electric vehicle is not an easy task. There is a big difference between the amount of solar energy that the best cells can take up and what it takes to move a two ton vehicle at high speed.

But Mercedes isn't the only one trying to make that happen. California startup Aptera, which crashed in the aftermath of the Great Recession, has recently revived. German startup Sono Motors is also working on solar-powered electric vehicles. And Dutch startup Lightyear recently found a manufacturing partner to make Lightyear One, a solar-powered electric vehicle.

Inside the Vision EQ XX has a huge 47.5 inch screen

Inside the Vision EQ XX, it features a huge 47.5-inch screen that spans the full width of the vehicle and nods to the company's new Hyperscreen infotainment display. However, unlike the Hyperscreen, which combines three separate screens in one 56-inch piece of glass, the Vision EQ XXs screen is a one-piece display with 8K resolution and state-of-the-art graphics.

Mercedes says it has worked with a company called NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop the first real-time 3D navigation system on a screen of this size. The company says the innovative navigation system will enable seamless zooming and scrolling from satellite views to 3D urban representations up to 10 meters high.

Like most of its competitors, Mercedes is moving at full speed towards the future of all-electricity. The company has announced that it will invest 40 billion ($ 47 billion) in electrifying its lineup by 2030, including electric versions of Mercedes-Benz G-class wagons and AMG high-performance vehicles.

These announcements will be made when most major countries are pushing to limit the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles in the coming decades. The European Union, China and California have all stated that they will ban the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035.

Based on the automaker's simulations, the Vision EQXX would use less than 10 kWh to travel 62 miles on public roads, delivering an efficiency of more than 6 miles per kWh. Converted into fossil fuel consumption, Mercedes says that's around the ""golden figure"" of 1 liter of gasoline per 62 miles.

The battery is half the size of and 30 percent lighter than the one in the EQS. However, it still has a capacity of almost 100 kWh. What's more, there are ultra-thin solar panels on the roof that can add up to 25 km (15.5 miles) of range.

The Vision EQXX is a lightweight car (1,750 kg or 3,858 lbs) that has been aerodynamically optimized. The automaker says that, with a drag coefficient of cd 0.17, the EV is more aerodynamic than a football (which has a cd of 0.18 to 0.2). What's more, Mercedes claims that 95 percent of battery energy is directed to the wheels.

Teams from Mercedes' research and development centers worked with its Formula 1 and Formula E engineers on the concept. They harnessed digital tools to reduce waste and weight by cutting out excess material -- the wheels are made with magnesium and the brake discs are built with aluminum alloy. The Vision EQXX uses recycled and plant-based materials too.

As for the interior, the Vision EQXX's infotainment system has a single 47.5-inch, mini-LED 8K screen. Like the Hyperscreen in the EQS, it spans almost the entire width of the cabin, though this is a one-piece display. The automaker worked with NAVIS Automotive Systems on a navigation system with zoom and scroll functions that include a satellite view. The ""Hey Mercedes"" voice assistant is integrated into the infotainment system too.

Even if Mercedes doesn't bring the Vision EQXX to show floors, developing the stylish concept has proven a valuable endeavor. It's already integrating many of the EV's features and developments into production. Some are being used in the next generation of the Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture for compact and medium-sized cars.","{'uri': 'engadget.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'engadget'}",[],https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7b89b3c0-6cc2-11ec-abfd-c1d68a682219,0.1843137254901961,,True,0.7568627595901489,0.1843137254901961,378931860,1

With a drag coefficient of only 0.17 and license plates, it seemed like a road-legal car able to reach 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) of range with a 100 kWh battery pack. Although the video presentation gave us just a glimpse of what this car may be if it reaches production lines, Mercedes-Benz told us almost everything we wanted to know. 29 photos The VISION EQXX is efficient not only because of its incredible drag coefficient but also because it tackled the most important aspects of spending the least possible amount of energy while moving. Its electric motor has an efficiency of 95%, and it is a lightweight machine compared to other EVs: the German carmakers said it weighs only around 1,750 kilograms (3,858 pounds). Although that is a lot if you compare it to combustion-engined vehicles, most competitors tip the scale at more than two tons.

Mercedes-Benz did not reveal all dimensions of the VISION EQXX, but it said it is a compact car. The only disclosed measure was the wheelbase: 2.80 meters (110.2 inches). A while ago, that would place it as a D-segment vehicle, but cars are growing, and compact is not what it used to be anymore.

The battery pack is also as small as Mercedes-Benz suggested. Cars with 100 kWh are among those with the most capacity in the market nowadays. What makes the VISION EQXX extraordinary is how far it can travel with that much energy. The best distance EVs with 100 kWh can travel nowadays do not exceed 400 miles. In other words, a production version of the concept car would be more than 50% more efficient. Like the Lucid Air, it works at more than 900V, which may be one of the explanations for that.

Mercedes-Benz gave other websites all the information about the VISION EQXX in advance, thanks to an embargo that seems to have been strictly respected. Thanks to that, they had a lot more time to dissect the car than we did, but we will get back to all the technical innovations that this car offers, such as how it managed to save weight and be more efficient than most other EVs.","{'uri': 'autoevolution.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'autoevolution'}","[{'uri': 'gustavo_henrique_ruffo@autoevolution.com', 'name': 'Gustavo Henrique Ruffo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/mercedes-benz-vision-eqxx-looks-road-legal-with-a-017-drag-coefficient-178169_1.jpg,0.2549019607843137,eng-7380045,False,0.5803921818733215,0.2549019607843137,378930780,1

Automakers have spent the past year announcing plans for electric car models and production facilities. That makes 2022 a year when growing numbers of consumers will be weighing whether it's time to buy their first EV. Is it worth taking the plunge?

That probably depends on the price point and market segment you're considering. My view is that the higher your price point, the more you should think about buying an EV now rather than waiting another couple years. Here's a couple reasons why: First, automakers are launching their higher-end models before down-market ones, so the selection is better at the top end. There's also the tricky proposition of thinking through residual values for used vehicles in the future -- demand for gasoline-powered cars will be shrinking, so buying a new one now means it will be worth a lot less by the time you're ready to trade up.

It's important to keep in mind that much of consumer behavior stems from automakers' actions. Manufacturers have gotten the message from investors that they'll be rewarded for accelerating the transition to electrics, while profits from gasoline-powered vehicles will serve mostly to fund those investments. The major automakers, following Tesla Inc.'s lead, are starting with higher-end models both because that's where consumer demand is strongest and because it's easier to be profitable at higher price points while sales volumes remain far below gasoline vehicles.

Adding to temptation for consumers, industry tastemakers are giving these new, pricey EV models high marks. MotorTrend magazine named Rivian's $74,000 R1T its truck of the year, and the even more expensive Lucid Air its car of the year. Both vehicles recently started consumer deliveries and have lengthy waiting lists.

Maybe you're impressed by what you've seen so far, but would rather wait a little longer until EV infrastructure like charging stations are more built out. But the value calculation for buying any new vehicle includes what it will be worth years later when you're ready to trade it in or sell it. The average length of time drivers hold onto new vehicles is 6 years. So if you're buying a new vehicle in 2022, you should be thinking about the market for used cars in 2028 or later.

The demographics of electric vehicle owners look a lot like Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk: on average, male, 40 to 55 years old, with an annual household income of more than $100,000. My colleague Nat Bullard recently posted some additional tables on EV buyer demographics. The percentage of new vehicles sold in the U.S. that are electrics in 2022 might still be in the single digits, but for this demographic it will be well above that.

Looking out to 2028, when the overall market share of EVs in the U.S. might be as high as 30%, the majority of affluent younger and middle-aged consumers might be purchasing electric cars and trucks. That's going to have a big impact on the value of used, gasoline-powered vehicles, with fewer buyers in every passing year.

While there might still be a robust market for used Honda Accords in 2028, it will probably be a more tenuous market for used gasoline-powered $40,000 sedans and sport utility vehicles as people in that segment switch over to EVs.

Meanwhile, though it's still early in its vehicle history, the market for used Tesla Model 3's has been robust. The cumulative impact of advertising campaigns shouldn't be overlooked either. Automakers aren't investing tens of billions of dollars into EVs only to have them sit in factories and dealer lots. They'll also use ad campaigns to make consumers believe that they're tech savvy, forward-thinking companies. By 2028, automakers will want affluent vehicle buyers to believe that gasoline-powered cars are as cool as floppy disks or having a landline -- the kind of thing your grandpa still has in his house.

What about cost? In a recent research note, Goldman Sachs pointed out that some segments of the EV market are already cost-competitive versus gasoline-powered vehicles after fuel and maintenance costs are factored in. Savings worked out to around $1,000 a year using a gasoline price per gallon of around $3, so buying a $60,000 EV breaks even compared with a $55,000 gasoline-powered vehicle after about five years.

And that's before taking tax incentives into account. It's hard to make a generalized point here because different states have different incentive levels, and at the national level an automaker like Tesla has used up its allotment of incentives while other automakers that haven't sold as many EVs to date still have some available. The proposed Build Back Better Act, currently stalled in the Senate, could include new incentives of $7,500 a vehicle or more, but we'll have to see in the new year whether that line item or the legislation as a whole becomes law. Still, even a scaled-down version of that proposal would make the financial rationale for buying an EV now much stronger.

A fair concern to have is the uncertainty surrounding the longevity and standards of the batteries that power electrics. Batteries do degrade somewhat over time -- a Tesla Model S battery loses 5% of its charging capacity after its first 50,000 miles -- but EV batteries are estimated to last between 10 and 20 years before needing to be replaced.

It's also possible that technological breakthroughs will lead to a fundamentally different kind of battery powering vehicles in the future. On some level it's weighing the uncertainty of changes in batteries against the certainty that the market for gasoline-powered vehicles will decline perpetually.

For utilitarian, budget-conscious car buyers, there's still reason to be confident that a new gasoline-powered vehicle bought in 2022 will retain a decent value in the used market towards the end of the decade. But for affluent consumers, it's less of a sure thing. Those high-end buyers who are thinking about waiting a little while longer to make their next vehicle an EV should consider going ahead with it in the new year.","{'uri': 'tech.hindustantimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Hindustan Times Tech'}",[],https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2022/01/03/1600x900/TESLA-GERMANY--12_1641218821860_1641218845293.JPG,0.3019607843137255,,False,0,0.3019607843137255,378929460,1

As with previous CES concepts by the Stuttgart-based company, the Vision EQXX is not a concrete forerunner of a production model but is intended to provide a preview of a range of technologies that aimed to make production vehicles more economical.

The mission of the car is to become the most efficient Mercedes-Benz ever built, as the manufacturer states. In terms of range, the Vision EQXX is to ""reach a new level"" with over 1,000 kilometres from a single battery charge. And this is not due to a larger battery, but to the more efficient use of energy. However, the 1,000 kilometres were not determined in a test, but based on internal, digital simulations, so ""it can be assumed that the technology carrier will travel over 1,000 kilometres in real road traffic on a single battery charge"", according to Mercedes.

The basic levers are anything but new: the powertrain itself is to become more efficient, lightweight materials reduce weight, special tyres lower rolling resistance. Combined with sophisticated aerodynamics - the cW is 0.17 - and integrated solar cells, consumption is to be reduced to below 10 kWh/100km.

What is supposed to be new about it is how these individual goals have been achieved - and how they have been integrated into a complete package. The ""radically new"" drive concept developed by Mercedes-Benz is supposed to enable an efficiency of 95 per cent from the battery to the wheels. This therefore concerns not only the electric drive system as such, but also the power electronics and the entire mechanics of the drive train. ""One of the best ways to increase efficiency is to reduce losses,"" says Eva Greiner, chief engineer for electric drive systems at Mercedes-Benz. ""We worked on every part of the system to reduce energy consumption and losses through system design, material selection, lubrication and thermal management. And our excellent simulation tools helped us to quickly find out what works and what doesn't.""

Mercedes does not go into more detail about the electric drive system in the statement, but they could be the radial flux motors made by Yasa, a specialist acquired by Mercedes. The power is said to be around 150 kW.

For the battery, the engineers collaborated with experts from the Formula 1 subsidiary High Performance Powertrains (HPP) and Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix (MGP). The lightweight battery housing contains 100 kWh, but the ready-to-install battery pack is only half the size and 30 per cent lighter than the battery pack from the Mercedes EQS. Daimler CEO Ola Källenius states that the battery ""would fit in a small car"". Adam Allsopp, Advanced Technology Director at HPP, adds: ""In the development of the battery management system and the power electronics, the greatest emphasis was placed on reducing losses. In achieving this efficiency milestone, we've learned a lot that will inform future development programmes.""

Specifically, an increased proportion of silicon in the anode is expected to contribute to the higher energy density - a route currently being taken by a number of companies. In addition, the battery platform developed by the Mercedes development department and HPP should achieve a higher degree of integration - in other words, more space for the cells with less installation space and weight. In addition, the battery voltage has been increased to 900 volts - as in the Lucid Air. Work has also been done on the battery management system: The battery has active cell balancing. It ensures that energy is drawn evenly from the cells while driving, which further increases system efficiency.

Although the battery is only charged by cable, the Vision EQXX has 117 ""ultra-thin"" solar cells integrated into the roof. The solar cells do not directly charge the high-voltage battery - Mercedes says it is still working on this with its partner Fraunhofer ISE - but are used for other systems. By reducing the energy demand from the high-voltage battery in this way, up to 25 kilometres of additional range per day should be possible. However, practical experience has so far shown that the effects are much smaller in Central Europe, for example.

Other consumers have also been given a helping hand: An innovative thermal management system is designed to increase the efficiency of the cooling of the vehicle components. A coordinated interaction of air flaps, coolant valves and water pumps is intended to ensure that the powertrain, including the power electronics, always operates within the optimum temperature window. The new ""multi-source heat pump"" has an external heat exchanger and can thus, according to Mercedes, operate over a wider temperature range - and, for example, also be able to utilise the last bit of residual heat when dehumidifying the ambient air thanks to the ""evaporator enthalpy"". . Enthalpy is the latent energy released as heat when water vapour in the air changes its state of aggregation from gaseous to liquid.

Other features of the EQXX are not directly related to the electric drive or other power consumers, but still have an impact on power consumption and thus range. The aerodynamic and lightweight body reduces air resistance and weight. The same applies to the clad magnesium rims. Lighter brake discs made of an aluminium alloy are installed under the rims, which also help to reduce the vehicle weight. In total, there are still about 1,750 kilograms. The battery accounts for 495 kilograms of this.

Another development derived from racing is the purely electric chassis, which uses a subframe inspired by Formula 1 racing cars. This brings ""racing efficiency to the road"", says Mercedes. Whether it also drives costs up to motorsport levels will then be seen in series development: Mercedes states that ""many of the innovative developments are already being integrated into production"", ""some of them also in the next generation of the MMA, the modular architecture for compact and mid-size vehicles from Mercedes-Benz"".","{'uri': 'electrive.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'electrive.com'}",[],https://www.electrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mercedes-benz-vision-eqxx-2022-04-min.png,0.3411764705882352,eng-7380045,False,0.6352941393852234,0.3411764705882352,378928920,1

Calling it ""the most efficient Mercedes-Benz ever built,"" MB pulled the virtual cover off its newest wind-slippery luxury sedan concept it claims will go 1000 kilometers on a charge, or 620 miles. Even though that figure is for the normally optimistic European WLTP cycle, it should still be impressive once it's run through our US-standard SAE mileage cycle.

Those 1000 kilometers (620 miles) were achieved on public roads, too, Mercedes said, not on some hyperbaric closed course.

Through various innovations and efficiencies, Mercedes says the EQXX will squeeze six miles from every kWh, an extraordinary achievement if true. Efficiencies range from a drag coefficient of 0.17 to ultra-low-rolling-resistance tires, lightweight aluminum alloy brakes, a lightweight ""F1"" subframe, and even ultra-thin solar panels on the roof that add 15.5 miles range by themselves.

The concept car was set to debut at CES in Las Vegas today, but after Mercedes and other carmakers pulled out of that tech show, the decision was made to post the reveal online, which is what you see here.

""The Mercedes-Benz VISION EQXX... answers the progressive demands of a modern generation of customers for and emotionality through innovation,"" Mercedes said, not even batting an eye at the invention of the word emotionality. ""Part of a far-reaching technology program, this software-defined research prototype was engineered by women and men with the creativity, ingenuity, and determination to deliver one of the planet's most efficient cars -- in every respect. They did so using the latest digital technology, the agility of a start-up and the speed of Formula 1.""

The lithium-iron-phosphate battery will be less than 100 kWh, Mercedes claims, meaning the car gets 100 miles more range with more than 20 kWh less battery than the recently acclaimed Lucid Air that manages 520 miles out of its 120-kWh battery. Even the new Mercedes EQS 450+ gets ""only"" 350 miles EPA range. (Just for comparison, I myself got about 417 miles range in an EQS 450+ without really trying.)

For comparison, the EQXX's super-slippery 0.17 coefficient of drag falls somewhere between that of a penguin (0.05) and an American football (0.18). The whole EQXX you see here is said to weigh around 3850 pounds.

""The VISION EQXX demonstrates that (more electric mobility with less waste) is all within reach in a real-world vehicle that pushes the envelope on all fronts,"" Mercedes said. ""It gives Mercedes-Benz customers a clear insight into what premium efficiency for the electric and digital era looks like and feels like. Beautiful design and intuitive operation enhanced by advanced digital technologies deliver sustainable, long-haul electric mobility that has Mercedes-Benz written all over it.""

The 150-kW (201-hp) drivetrain achieves its performance while maintaining 95-percent efficiency, MB says.

""That means up to 95% of the energy from the battery ends up at the wheels -- pure and simple. Compare that to just 30% from even the most efficient ICE drivetrain or around 50% from an average (human) long-distance runner.""

Mercedes worked with its own Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains in Brixworth, UK, to redesign the drivetrain and reduce typical system losses.

""We worked on every part of the system to reduce energy consumption and losses through system design, material selection, lubrication and heat management,"" said Eva Greiner, chief engineer of the electric drive system at Mercedes-Benz.

The electric drive unit in the Vision EQXX features a new generation of silicon carbides and runs on an unprecedented 900 volts of power. Other efficiencies include a rear track two inches narrower than the front, as well as unique aerodynamics to keep the airflow stuck to the front wheels.

Inside are door pulls made from Biosteel fiber, vegan leather mycelium fabric, Deserttex sustainable cactus-based biomaterial, as well as carpets made from 100-percent bamboo fiber.

The chassis is made of MS1500 ultra-high strength martensitic steel; the doors are carbon fiber-reinforced plastic.

It's all pretty impressive. Now let's see how much of it makes its way into a production car.","{'uri': 'autoweek.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Autoweek'}",[],"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2021-12-21-image-22c0001-058-1641199199.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.803xh;0,0.141xh&resize=640:*",0.2705882352941176,eng-7380045,False,0.6784313917160034,0.2705882352941176,378928320,1

The Vision EQXX was revealed virtually Monday ahead of the CES technology conference as the future, well, vision of Mercedes' electric vehicle lineup. Its first all-electric EQS sedan started delivering just a few weeks ago (with a $102,000 starting price), but Mercedes is already looking to what's next.

For future Mercedes EVs, expect long ranges -- up to 620 miles. The EQS battery offers about 450 miles on a single charge, and the longest-range vehicle already on the road is the Lucid Air Dream edition with its 520-mile battery.

But for Mercedes, a compact and efficient battery is crucial. The battery's energy consumption is only 10 kWh per 100 kilometers, or 6 miles per kWh. Its energy density means there's 100 kWh of energy but at only half the size of the EQS' battery pack. The EQS uses over 15 kWh per 100 kilometers.

Trying to maintain efficient driving meant unique exterior design choices. Mercedes described the shape as ""more aerodynamic than a football."" But this will be a sleek vehicle, compared by its creators to a ""water droplet"" with a small front area and an air curtain over the front bumper, along with wheel covers.

Solar power roof panels can add up to 15 miles of range and power the car lights, infotainment system and other features, which plays into a focus on recycled materials throughout the car.

There's vegan silk-like fabric on the doors, and vegan leather made from mycelium -- the roots of mushrooms -- along with a cactus-based material also for seating and interior spaces. On the floor there's carpeting made from bamboo fiber and a plastic alternative made from recycled materials like bottles.

The front hyperscreen is already impressive (and expensive) in the EQS lineup, but this concept takes the giant touchscreen to the next level. A seamless (meaning one continuous screen) 47.5-inch display spans the entire dashboard with 8K resolution. For mapping there's a 3D navigation system.

The EQXX still uses Mercedes' voice control system, but it's now infused with AI. Working with a machine learning company, the car uses neuromorphic computing which thinks more like a human to reduce energy consumption while running commands.

The voice assistant can turn into an efficiency assistant suggesting certain driving modes and styles. You can see what's coming up ahead with a display of speed, incline, wind, and resistance and how that's using up energy.","{'uri': 'mashable.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Mashable'}",[],https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00mEovyEmhBT4mTt24kUPhW/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1641227259.jpg,0.2549019607843137,eng-7380045,False,0.6470588445663452,0.2549019607843137,378927240,1

The Vision EQXX concept is not all about horsepower, like some of the more recent EVs, but instead it prioritizes efficiency to give it a range over 620 miles on a single charge.

That long range beats the Lucid Air Dream's 520-mile EPA rating, but Mercedes-Benz says that the range is not based on an EPA or WLTP estimate. Instead the 620 mile range figure is the result of ""digital simulations based in real-life traffic conditions."" The EQXX only has 201 horsepower, but its range is impressive.

The EQXX is a compact sedan and it looks close to a production model, but it likely just previews what the brand has planned for its EV future. According to Mercedes-Benz, the EQXX is a ""technology blueprint for series production.""

On the outside the EQXX features a sleek body with a drag coefficient of only 0.17. That sleek shape is part of the reason that the EQXX has such a long driving range. Mercedes-Benz says that the EQXX can travel six miles on only 1.0 kWh of electrical energy. The powertrain is also 95 percent efficient with only five percent of the energy that is put back into the battery pack not being used.

The EQXX is powered by a 900-volt battery pack and its battery is 50 percent smaller than the battery in the EQS. Mercedes-Benz has not revealed if the single motor powers the front or rear wheels. It does also get solar panels that can add up to 15 miles of range on a sunny day.

Inside the futuristic interior features an ELX screen that spans the entire width of the dashboard. It's 47.5 inches wide and has 8K resolution with a 7680-by-660-pixel display. The interior is all about sustainability too with carpet made from bamboo and seats that are made out of either mushrooms or cactus fibers.","{'uri': 'thetorquereport.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Torque Report'}","[{'uri': 'marc_carter@thetorquereport.com', 'name': 'Marc Carter', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.thetorquereport.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-07_Image_22C0001-151-source.jpeg,0.1607843137254903,eng-7380045,False,0.7882353067398071,0.1607843137254903,378927240,1

Despite Elon Musk's dramatic stock selloff that briefly put a dent in Tesla's share price in the final weeks of 2021, the company proved to investors that its core business remained solid. On Sunday, the electric carmaker reported record quarterly and full-year earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations.

Tesla delivered 308,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter and 936,000 vehicles in 2021, which almost doubled the total shipment of 2020. Analysts had expected the company to deliver around 270,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter and 897,000 vehicles for the full year.

Tesla shares jumped more than 9 percent Monday morning on the news, pushing the company's market cap to $1.17 trillion.

The vast majority (90 percent) of Tesla's 2021 deliveries were Model 3 and Model Y. The company reports combined delivery numbers for its higher-priced vehicles (Model S and X) and lower-priced Model 3 and Y vehicles. It doesn't break out sales or production numbers by region.

""Great work by Tesla team worldwide!"" Musk tweeted Sunday.

""This was a 'trophy case' quarter for Musk & Co. with massive momentum moving into 2022,"" Wedbush's Daniel Ives, a top Tesla analyst, tweeted Sunday.

Since turning a profit for the first time in the third quarter of 2019, Tesla has managed to double shipments every year -- despite a global chip shortage that has slowed down manufacturing for other automakers for the better part of the past two years. Still, Musk has set a lofty goal for Tesla to ramp up production to 20 million electric vehicles a year by 2030. That's 20 times what it made last year. ""Let's make the roaring 20's happen!"" the CEO tweeted Sunday.

To achieve that, Tesla plans to start production of the Model Y crossover at a new ""gigafactory"" in Austin, Texas this year and open another factory in Brandenburg, Germany near Berlin.

For the near term, Wall Street is optimistic that Tesla can double sales again in 2022. ""Can Tesla do [two million] units in 2022? At this point we'd still describe 2mm as a stretch target but one that looks far more realistic following 4Q deliveries,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note on Monday. ""We believe that fully ramped, the addition of Berlin and Austin will take the Tesla global installed capacity to closer to 3 million units.""

Jonas cautioned that continued global supply chain challenges may dampen this outlook. Also, as more startups and legacy auto brands enter the EV market, Tesla is expected to lose some of its market share in the years to come. In the high-end sector, Tesla faces competition from already hyped models such as Lucid Air and Porsche Taycan, as well as luxury EVs by Mercedes and Audi. In the mass market, the Model 3 and Model Y will be challenged by offerings from Volkswagen, GM and Ford, not to mention a crop of well funded Chinese EV startups that are increasingly eating away Tesla's market share in China, its largest overseas market.","{'uri': 'observer.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Observer'}","[{'uri': 'sissi_cao@observer.com', 'name': 'Sissi Cao', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/GettyImages-1284007888.jpg?quality=80&w=876&h=438&crop=1&strip,0.1686274509803922,eng-7377007,False,0.7960784435272217,0.1686274509803922,378926880,1

The new Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX concept is interesting in its own right, but doubly so because it serves as a physical acknowledgment of a harsh truth for car makers: bigger batteries aren't a one-size-fits-all solution to making electric vehicles more usable.

Radical new construction methods, lightweighting processes and, of course, painstaking attention to aerodynamic detail will be utterly crucial as EVs start being produced at volumes comparable to fossil fuel-burners, and especially so given the cross-industry focus on sustainability.

However, although the benefits of the EQXX's design and positioning are plain as day, its principles can't be applied so readily to bulbous, high-riding SUVs, which are the spécial du jour and look certain to remain so on the menu for the coming years.

We are therefore likely to see elements from the concept rolled out gradually to other production models, rather than a showroom-ready version of the EQXX itself.

Already, though, Mercedes has hit the ground running with EV equivalents of its ever-popular E-Class and S-Class models in the form of the EQE and EQS, respectively, and an EV alternative to the C-Class is on the cards for after 2024. Clearly, reports of the saloon segment's death are much exaggerated, it's just that the conventional three-box silhouette - which surely any child would return if asked to draw a car - needs rounding off to best suit electric propulsion.

Indeed, some of the most impressive range figures of all EVs on sale today are touted by monolithic saloons like the Porsche Taycan, Lucid Air, Tesla Model 3 and the EQS itself. Eventually, the toss-up between 10 miles of added range or 10mm of extra headroom will surely become a deciding factor in the future of the all-conquering SUV.

Perhaps the ultimate truth is that to go further, we must sit lower, and sleek, slippery saloons such as this will soon come back into fashion as the EV mile-munchers that we so sorely crave.","{'uri': 'autocar.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Autocar'}","[{'uri': 'felix_page@autocar.co.uk', 'name': 'Felix Page', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/mercedes-benz-vision-eqxx-241_0.jpg,0.2627450980392156,,False,0,0.2627450980392156,378926640,1

2021 was another great year for the U.S. stock market. The S&P 500 rose 27%, nearly doubling in the last three years alone. Yet many well-known and smaller growth stocks are hovering around their 52-week lows as Wall Street focuses on profitable companies with steady earnings and punishes pandemic winners that can't sustain 2020's breakneck growth rates.

Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are two growth stocks that could rebound in 2022 and beyond. Here's what makes each a great buy now.

Lucid stock finished 2021 up 280% for the year, making it the best-performing U.S. automaker. Yet even with that monster gain, Lucid is still down 40% from its high as waves of euphoria clash with fierce skepticism.

Both bulls and bears make good points. Lucid's impressive technology, competent management team, and growing list of accolades paint a picture of what could be if all goes according to plan. However, Lucid is years away from achieving positive operating cash flow, let alone becoming profitable. Its growth story is likely still in the first or second inning, yet it already has a $62 billion valuation.

Lucid is a high-risk, high-reward player in the EV space. Most investors are probably better suited simply waiting for Lucid's growth story to mature into something more tangible (sustained production and delivery growth). Yet others with a higher risk tolerance could consider a starter position in Lucid, trusting that its rich cash position will propel it to capture a significant share of the luxury electric sedan and SUV market.

You may be scratching your head as to why PayPal stock fell nearly 20% in 2021. After all, PayPal is very profitable, generates a ton of free cash flow, has a lot of cash on its balance sheet, and is an industry-leading financial services business that holds a vital role in business-to-business transactions and peer-to-peer payments.

Yet there's no denying that PayPal added fewer new accounts in the first nine months of 2021 than in the same period in 2020. Its revenue grew 21% year over year in 2020. In Q1 2021, PayPal grew revenue by 31% year over year. In Q2, it only grew revenue by 19% year over year. And in Q3, it grew revenue by just 13% year over year. For all of 2021, PayPal estimates revenue will grow by 18% compared to 2020, and non-GAAP earnings per share will grow by 19%.

PayPal isn't growing as fast as it used to. But it's also a much more stable and profitable business. PayPal stands to be a long-term winner as e-commerce grows and the financial system becomes increasingly decentralized. A year or two of slowing growth when the underlying business is stronger than ever isn't a good enough reason to sell. Down around 40% from its high, PayPal looks like a great stock to buy now.

PayPal and Lucid are two completely different businesses that both have their fair share of long-term potential. PayPal's existing foothold in the financial sector should enjoy steady growth as consumers shift away from cash and businesses capitalize on e-commerce and the gig economy. Lucid is building a reputation for delivering on its promises in an exciting industry, but the reality is that no one knows which businesses will rise and fall as the auto industry embraces electrification. Investors should bear in mind that PayPal offers much less volatility than Lucid, which saw its share price dip as low as $16.12 and climb as high as $57.75 in the second half of 2021.

Managing risk by diversifying into a basket of EV stocks or dollar-cost averaging into growth stocks is a great way to capture upside while limiting downside risk.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'daniel_foelber@fool.com', 'name': 'Daniel Foelber', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659528/gettyimages-1315119763.jpg,0.4274509803921569,eng-7386748,False,0.658823549747467,0.4274509803921569,378926520,17

And it's the range of Mercedes' new concept EV that is the real headline-grabbing stat, with the German manufacturer claiming the Vision EQXX can travel over 1,000km (over 620 miles) on a single charge - a market leading figure.

To give you an idea of the distance you could theoretically drive on a single charge of the EQXX, the range is equivalent to a trip from Berlin to Paris, from New York City to Cincinnati, Ohio, or from Beijing to Nanjing.

Mercedes claims, based on average distances driven per year, Vision EQXX drivers in the US and China would - on average - only have to recharge twice a month, while European drivers would typically only have to recharge once a month.

What's more, the firm says it has squeezed the energy of its flagship Mercedes-Benz EQS into the dimensions of a compact car, with this technological breakthrough aided by the firm's Formula 1 know-how.

As this is a concept, the EV won't actually go on sale, but Mercedes says it's very close to a production car, with a number of technologies featured here set to make their way into an electric car from the brand in 2024 or 2025.

During an exclusive press briefing with Daimler AG's Chief Technology Officer for the Vision EQXX, Markus Schafer said a ""number of elements of the car are close to moving into [a] production [vehicle]. We're very close to a serious car we'll see in 2024.""

That includes its new battery technology with offers up the car's massive range, as well as the upgraded MBUX operating system splashed across the mammoth display inside the car.

Mercedes is keen to make its electric cars as efficient as possible, as Schafer explains. ""We think range matters for our customers, and efficiency matters. This program is all about efficiency and reducing electrical consumption.

""Want to have the lowest possible consumption"", and the Vision EQXX certainly showcases that desire.

Battery chemists at Mercedes have managed to produce a battery with a capacity of 100kW in a package that is 50% smaller and 30% lighter than the comparable battery in the EQS.

What this means is EV development is moving rapidly, and smaller electric vehicles now have the opportunity to benefit from increased range - something that has mainly been reserved for larger vehicles, until now.

Another aspect that helps the Vision EQXX gain so much range is its aerodynamics. The EQS holds the world record as the first production car in the world with a Cd value of 0.20 (beating out the Lucid Air with its 0.21 score), but the EQXX bests that value, with a drag coefficient rating of Cd 0.17.

There's even a 'lightweight F1 subframe' at play here, which Mercedes says ""brings racing efficiency to the road."" That should translate to some pretty impressive acceleration and top speed stats, although Mercedes has yet to reveal what these are.

The Vision EQXX also features a retractable rear diffuser that deploys at high speeds, and 20-inch, forged-magnesium wheels.

All of this helps the Vision EQXX achieve its market-leading 1,000km (around 620 miles) range on a single charge, and it also supports fast charging that can see 300km (roughly 186 miles) replenished in 15 minutes.

We've seen a number of electric car manufacturers dabble with solar panels on their vehicles already, and the Vision EQXX joins the crowd with 117 solar cells on its roof.

Unlike other EV solar-panel-systems however, the setup on the EQXX could be far more useful, with Mercedes claiming that the ultra-thin roof panels ""can add up to 25km (around 15 miles) of range on long-distance journeys in a day.""

Now, that is the absolute best-case scenario in ""ideal conditions"", but it's significantly better than Hyundai's quoted 5-6 miles per day on the solar-panel clad Ioniq 5.

Energy gained via the solar cells is stored in a separate battery, which is used to power the climate blower, lights, infotainment system and other ancillaries - leaving more juice in the main battery for actual driving.

And this technology isn't just reserved for the Vision EQXX concept, with Schafer confirming that it will feature ""in future vehicles"".

Inside the Vision EQXX you'll find a range of sustainable materials, from a verified vegan leather alternative made from mycelium in the detail of the seat cushions to high-strength, biotechnology-based and certified-vegan silk-like fabric used for the door pulls.

Meanwhile, the carpets are made from 100% bamboo fiber, and recycled PET bottles feature in the cabin materials.

What dominates the interior however, is the screen Mercedes uses. This is the first time the firm is offering a completely seamless display in a car - the 'Hyperscreen' in the EQS is actually three separate displays in one curved glass unit.

The Vision EQXX one-ups Hyperscreen with its own 47.5-inch mini-LED display, which stretches from pillar to pillar, across the entire dash, and features an eye-popping 8K resolution.

On-screen you'll find a real-time 3D navigation system, an enhanced 'Hey Mercedes' voice assistant and even an efficiency assistant to help you get the most range from your charge.

As we've already said, the Mercedes Vision EQXX is a concept electric car, so it's never going to hit the market.

However, the advancements made here will translate to future Mercedes EVs - be it extended range, better battery efficiency, the introduction of more solar panels or just massive screens. There's plenty to get excited about.","{'uri': 'techradar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TechRadar'}","[{'uri': 'john_mccann@techradar.com', 'name': 'John McCann', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HzLkXymt3SavAVGiFW6HJG-1200-80.jpg,0.2392156862745098,eng-7380045,False,0.8352941274642944,0.2392156862745098,378926520,1

Mercedes started development of the EQXX with the goal of rethinking every element of an electrically powered vehicle in order to maximize efficiency. The result, the automaker claims, is a car that can cover 1,000 kilometers (approximately 621 miles) of real-world driving on a single charge, or about 100 miles more than the current range king, the 520-mile Lucid Air Dream Edition Range.

The EQXX is a sedan that weighs approximately 3,858 pounds, has a wheelbase of 110 inches, generates a peak 201 hp, and runs on a 900-volt electrical system. The wheels are an aerodynamic design measuring 20 inches across and are wrapped in Bridgestone's Turanza Eco tire.

Mercedes tapped all of its various divisions to help maximize the car's efficiency, including the Formula One team. This extends to the software used by the car. Other key efficiency areas include the design of the electric motors, the use of lightweight materials, and the optimization of aerodynamics.

In the case of aero, we're talking a coefficient of drag of about 0.17, thus beating the 0.20 Cd rating of the Mercedes EQS -- which has the lowest rating for a production vehicle. And a single drive unit combining an electric motor, transmission and power electronics featuring a new generation of silicon carbides, helps transfer 95% of energy stored in the battery to the wheels.

Another key area is heat management. A system of aero-shutters, coolant valves and water pumps helps keep the drive unit and battery from overheating. Conversely, when conditions are cold, which normally reduces range, the system can help preserve heat. A heat pump is also present to help draw heat from the drive system for keeping the cabin warm. It also features an external heat exchanger that draws heat from the ambient air to help warm up the cabin faster.

Weight reduction was achieved via the increased use of lightweight materials. However, there was also a new technique employed for some structural elements, where software tools were used to design parts with high-strength, low-material characteristics, resulting in somewhat organic-looking forms. We've seen something similar from companies like hypercar startup Czinger.

Finally, the EQXX features a solar array connected to its own small battery. Energy generated by the solar array is used to power ancillaries like the lights, infotainment system, and other cabin features. This takes some load off the main battery.

In terms of overall efficiency, Mercedes said the concept uses less than 10 kwh of electricity per 100 km. That's the amount of energy needed to run a home's air conditioner or tumble dryer for about three hours.

The main battery is close to 100 kwh in capacity and features a density of about 400 watt-hours per liter. What this means is that the battery has almost the same capacity as the battery in the EQS but is half the size and 30% lighter. This was primarily achieved via better packaging of the cells, plus the use of anodes with high silicon content -- which means they can hold more energy.

Compared to the technology elsewhere in the vehicle, the interior appears somewhat conventional. It features current Mercedes design themes, but with a futuristic flair. Highlights include the wide screen spanning the dash, as well as the sustainable materials used throughout. One of these is a leather-like material made from mycelium, which is the underground structure of mushrooms and other fungi.

While Mercedes isn't expected to launch a production version of the Vision EQXX, lessons learned in developing it will benefit future EVs from the automaker. Mercedes said it will spend more than 40 billion euros (approximately $45.3 billion) on EV development between 2022 and 2030.

The Vision EQXX is Mercedes' highlight for the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show starting Jan. 5 in Las Vegas.

But unlike those vehicles, the Vision EQXX is just a concept with no concrete production plans. (For now.)

Mercedes, which has been teasing the vehicle for several weeks, finally unveiled it (virtually) at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. (Like most of the major companies, Mercedes canceled its plans to attend CES in person amid a rise in COVID-19 cases.)

The company says it based its range estimates on a simulation of real-life traffic conditions, fueling claims that it will consume energy at a rate of 10kWh per 100 kilometers, or more than 6 miles per kWh. Translated into fossil-fuel consumption terms, this is around the ""golden figure"" of 235 miles-per-gallon in the US, or 1 liter of gasoline per 100 kilometers.

To put this into perspective, Mercedes notes that 10kWh is the equivalent of using a tumble dryer or an air conditioning unit for three hours or watching 50 hours of television on a 50-inch LED screen.

But despite these simulations and estimates, Mercedes says the Vision EQXX's superior range is ""completely realistic"" and that many of its technological advancements will be integrated into future production vehicles through the Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture.

Mercedes says it achieved this energy efficiency not by cramming an oversized battery under the floor of the vehicle but by ""pull[ing] out all the stops in drivetrain efficiency, energy density, aerodynamics, and lightweight design... The result is an efficiency masterpiece.""

Lightweight is certainly one way to describe a vehicle with a gross weight of 1,750 kg (3,858 lbs), putting it more in the category of compact SUVs than sports cars. Most of that weight is probably in the battery pack, which holds nearly 100 kWh of energy but also registers 50 percent less volume and 30 percent less mass than the Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan. The slippery teardrop shape is meant to reduce aerodynamic drag, with Mercedes claiming a ""benchmark"" coefficient of 0.17 based on a 140km/h wind tunnel test -- an improvement over the EQS' record-setting 0.20 drag coefficient.

Of course, a range estimate is just that: an estimate. It will be up to the Environmental Protection Agency in the US, as well as Europe's Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), to certify any EV range independently. Most electric vehicles on the market today have a range that falls between 200-300 miles, while some earlier models have less than that. The latest crop of EVs has ranges of 250-300 miles.

Of course, EV range is highly subjective. Even the EPA's rating system is only meant to present a snapshot under the specific conditions of the agency's testing process. It typically excludes factors such as steep hill climbing and the effects of cold weather, which can wear down a vehicle's battery much faster than when driving on flat surfaces or in warmer weather.

The Vision EQXX will get some help from the 117 solar cells installed in the vehicle's roof. Developed in collaboration with Europe's largest solar energy research institute, the solar roof is meant to offset the energy drain on the high-voltage system while also increasing the range. According to Mercedes, the solar cells can add up to 25 km of range on long-distance journeys under ideal conditions in a single day.

For now, we'll have to take their word. Using solar cells to power an electric vehicle is no small feat. There's a huge disparity between the amount of solar energy that the best cells can capture and what's needed to make a two-ton vehicle move at speed.

But Mercedes isn't the only company trying to make it happen. Aptera -- a California startup that crashed in the aftermath of the Great Recession -- was recently resurrected. German startup Sono Motors is also working on a solar-powered electric car. And Dutch startup Lightyear recently found a manufacturing partner to build its solar-powered electric car, the Lightyear One.

The interior of the Vision EQXX features a massive 47.5-inch screen that stretches the full width of the vehicle, a nod to the company's new Hyperscreen infotainment display. But unlike the Hyperscreen, which is an amalgam of three separate screens set inside one solid, 56-inch piece of glass, the Vision EQXX's screen is a one-piece display that will also feature 8K resolution and cutting edge graphics.

Mercedes says it's working with a company called NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop ""the first realtime 3D navigation system"" on a screen of this size. This novel navigation system will enable ""seamless zoom and scroll functions from satellite view down to a height of 10 meters in the 3D city representation,"" the company says.

Like most of its competitors, Mercedes is barreling toward an all-electric future at full speed. The company says it will commit €40 billion ($47 billion) to the electrification of its lineup by 2030, including electric versions of Mercedes-Benz's G-class wagons and AMG high-performance vehicles.

These announcements come as most major countries push to restrict the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles in the coming decades. The European Union, China, and California have all said they would ban the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035.","{'uri': 'theverge.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Verge'}","[{'uri': 'andrew_j_hawkins@theverge.com', 'name': 'Andrew J.

From the hotly-debated high-flier Tesla, Wall Street's newest darling Rivian, traditional-stalwarts turned EV-upstarts GM and Ford to the numerous SPAC-deal makers that have come public in this red-hot space, The Fly has you covered with ""Charged,"" a weekly recap of the top stories and expert calls in the sector.

TESLA DELIVERIES: Tesla (TSLA) said that in the fourth quarter, it achieved production of more than 305,000 vehicles and deliveries of over 308,000 vehicles. In 2021, the EV maker delivered over 936,000 vehicles.

Commenting on the numbers, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives noted that Tesla announced a fourth quarter delivery number that beat even the bull case whisper number on the Street. This was a ""trophy case"" quarter for the company, with ""massive momentum"" moving into 2022, the analyst contended. Ives also pointed out that the strength was driven by robust Model 3/Y sales of 297,000 versus the Street of 252,000 with Model S/X of 12,000 versus the Street's 13,000. Total production in the quarter was 306,000 and was roughly 20,000 ahead of his estimates. With the chip shortage a major overhang on the auto space and logistical issues globally, these delivery numbers were ""jaw dropping"" and speaks to an EV demand trajectory that looks robust for Tesla heading into 2022, Ives added. The analyst has an Outperform rating and a price target of $1,400 on the shares. His 2022 bull case target is $1,800.

Meanwhile, RBC Capital analyst Joseph Spak raised the firm's price target on Tesla to $1,005 from $950 and kept a Sector Perform rating on the shares as record fourth quarter deliveries of 308,600 and strong production well exceeded expectations. The analyst expects shares to start the year off strongly, but believes 2022 results are ultimately most dependent on the pace of capacity expansion.

JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman also raised the firm's price target on Tesla to $295 from $250, while maintaining an Underweight rating on the shares. The analyst increased estimates after Tesla reported ""much stronger than expected"" fourth quarter deliveries. The analyst now forecasts fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.22, up from $1.54 prior and above the Bloomberg consensus of $1.98. He extrapolates the higher rate of Q4 deliveries into future quarters also, resulting in more operating leverage than previously modeled.

NIO, LI, XPENG DELIVERIES: XPeng (XPEV) announced it delivered 16,000 Smart EVs in December 2021. Total deliveries for the fourth quarter 2021 reached 41,751 units, a 222% increase year-over-year, including 21,342 P7 deliveries. Total vehicle deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2021, reached 98,155, representing a 263% increase year-over-year. As of December 31, 2021, the company's cumulative Smart EV deliveries reached 137,953.

NIO (NIO) also announced its December, fourth quarter and full year 2021 delivery results, with the carmaker saying it delivered 10,489 vehicles in December 2021, 25,034 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021, and 91,429 vehicles in 2021 in total. As of December 31, 2021, cumulative deliveries of the ES8, ES6 and EC6 reached 167,070 vehicles.

Lastly, Li Auto (LI) announced that the company delivered 14,087 Li ONEs in December 2021, representing a 130.0% increase year-over-year. This took its fourth quarter deliveries to 35,221, up 40.2% quarter over quarter and 143.5% year over year. Total deliveries in 2021 increased 177.4% year-over-year to 90,491. The cumulative deliveries of Li ONE reached 124,088 since the vehicle's market debut.

TESLA RECALL: According to a letter ""serving to acknowledge Tesla, Inc.'s notification to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of a safety recall,"" the EV maker is ""recalling all 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles,"" the regulator announced last week. The rearview camera cable harness may be damaged by the opening and closing of the trunk lid, preventing the rearview camera image from displaying, noted the NHTSA, which said that Tesla Service will inspect and install a guide protector and new cable harness as necessary, free of charge.

LEADING EV TECH: Last week, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli resumed coverage of Lucid Group (LCID) with a Buy rating and $57 price target. The company has demonstrated leading electric vehicle technology ""credentials with a best-in-class blend of range, performance, charging dynamics and price,"" Michaeli told investors in a research note.

Where Is the Rest of Wall Street?,"Citigroup is staying bullish on electric-vehicle startup Lucid to start the new year. Analyst resumed coverage of Lucid with and $57 price target.

Lucid (ticker: LCID) stock was up 1.6% in premarket trading. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose about 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.

Analysts can suspend coverage of a stock for a number of reasons, chief among them is a requirement to do so when the bank is working with the company on a large project. Citi wasn't immediately available to comment when asked about the reason for Michaeli's recent suspension.

But he's back and the $57 target price is the highest on Wall Street, according to Bloomberg and FactSet. Lucid targets are all over the place, ranging from about $16 to $57 a share.

That isn't much help to investors. The number of ratings doesn't help much either. There are only four people covering Lucid stock, according to Bloomberg. Two rate shares at Buy, one has a Hold rating and one a Sell.

Lucid stock, however, is valued at about $63 billion. A car company of that size should have 20-plus analysts covering the stock. Rivian Automotive (RIVN), another EV startup, has about 15 analysts .

Rivian, however, became publicly traded in a traditional initial public offering. Lucid went public via as SPAC merger. That can be one reason for the difference in coverage. Still, Lucid finished its merger months ago. It's a little odd, frankly, that so few have picked up coverage of a stock worth so much.

The $57 price target values Lucid at about at almost $100 billion. That would make it one of the most valuable car companies on the planet.

""We are constructive on the Lucid story and its position in the EV/Car of the Future theme,"" wrote the analyst in a report on Monday. He believes Lucid has industry leading range and charging performance as well as solid internally developed self-driving features.

Still, he notes that Lucid is pre-sales. The company is just on the cusp of delivering volume of its first luxury sedan, the Lucid Air, in 2022. For now, Michaeli prefers the potential of Lucid to the more established EV player Tesla (TSLA). Michaeli actually rates Tesla stock Sell. His recent Tesla target price was $262, valuing that stock at about $262 billion.

Cronenweth: It always starts with the story and with an Aaron Sorkin script you are going to be taken on a human rollercoaster of emotion and humor through challenging interpersonal relationships. Spherical 2:40 was the right choice in representing the scale (or lack of) and the era the film takes place during. The approach to ""Being The Ricardos"" was to capture the rich tonalities of the '50s and keep characters present in their worlds but isolated as individuals contemplating their personal challenges. The idea was to embrace contrast dramatically but never have darkness for the sake of dark and to keep the sets rich but with points of light appreciating the space. Then we utilized 8k to create a shallow depth of field isolating the actors but keeping spatial content. Shooting a period piece, you are always attracted to the technical imperfections and limitations of that era and determining what to embrace. I went with the Arri DNA glass as they were the perfect balance of both worlds: full frame lenses that were conceived out of vintage glass rehoused in contemporary casings, bringing the artifacts and aberrations that add so much character to the visuals without the veiling and hazing from old coatings. Each lens had its own personality and brought a little bit of magic to each shot.

Zambarloukos: To start, we wanted to make a film without the use of traditional film lighting, something that would feel authentic to the atmosphere of Belfast. We looked at Magnum photographers of the time like Philip Jones Griffiths and imagined a feel like that of a LIFE magazine spread. So we built our sets with real practical lighting, carefully positioned windows and exterior spaces (alongside production designer Jim Clay) to maximize natural light, and chose our camera package to try to design our look architecturally and naturalistically.

We also wanted to be as immersive as possible, choosing a medium-format compact digital camera and 65mm film lenses: a unique combination of the very latest camera and one of a kind vintage lenses. You get to see every freckle on our young protagonist's face, with lucid and intimate compositions that show everything from the particular point-of-view of a child.

The decision to shoot mostly in black and white was for us a means of drawing the audience in and drawing the story out organically. Color focuses on how people look, but black and white has the power to portray how people feel. It has the unique ability to transcend, simultaneously imaginative and naturalistic, seeming to capture characters both without and within. If a film's ultimate aim is to explore the human condition - and portraiture is the landscape of the human condition - then film can reveal humanity's most beautiful colors in black and white.

Lenoir: I like the way these two sets of lenses, the Summilux primes and Fujinon Premier, perfectly match. I am not a big fan of flare and with these lenses I can shoot against windows with minimum degradation.

Huidobro: ""CODA"" is a powerful coming of age story set in a fishing town in Massachusetts. The intention behind our our visual language was to tell the story in a realistic yet intimate way. We wanted to capture what it feels like to be 17, the struggles of becoming your own person and the unique sense of possibility, hope and some times heartache with the choices life presents.

""CODA"" is the story of Ruby, a hearing girl in a deaf family. The story was full warmth, a strong loving family, a fishing village, a high school, and a community. We wanted the images to make you feel part of it. Nature, the ocean and music were also always present on our mind as we told the story. I loved the resolution of the Sony Venice for the wide landscapes and the ocean. I loved the tonal range and the high iso. The lenses are really beautiful portrait lenses.

Ryan: This film was always going to be black and white and we tested all different cameras and formats ... but decided on the Arri Mini as it held up well to all the other cameras and I felt it was very quick and versatile in the way we needed to shoot. Obviously, being a black and white film, it had a look imposed to tell the story in a certain way. It helped merge the different types of story telling into a uniform way. It's a joy to work in a black and white world!

McGarvey: We wanted lenses that could be filtered softer for the more romantic, innocent beginning of the film. I used Christian Dior 10 denier nets on the back of the lenses. Sometimes the effect was quite strong so we also had a set of Tiffen Black Glimmer Glass. The city of Noto where we shot has the most beautiful Baroque architecture with honey colored stone which the Sicilian light bounces off so beautifully. This showed me how to approach the lighting tones of the film. When the story moves into war, which we shot on Mount Etna in Sicily, I pulled all the filters and we shot clean to give veracity and contrast to the picture. We wanted a much more monochromatic, lithographic feel.

At the end of the film when Cyrano goes to see Roxanne at the convent, we consciously overexposed the scenes to create a celestial whiteness to depict the onset of death. We shot large format on the Alexa LF because although we have many big vistas and wide shots we knew that a lot of the storytelling was going to be in portraiture and big close ups. This format with the Leitz glass were perfect for this.

Shinomiya: The film crew needed to have a minimal presence on this film, because the cast was the primary focus and the crew respected this. The direction of Ryusuke Hamaguchi restrains the emotion of the images as much as possible, putting the emphasis on the acting. We needed to depict accurately what happened before the camera, and we could capture the charm of the subjects directly thanks to the expressiveness of Zeiss ultra prime. By using the Alexa mini, we had a rich expressiveness and stable mobility to grasp the moments, which happened inevitably and accidentally through the direction's approach.

Fraser: We tested film and digital extensively to craft the look of these worlds. Film felt too nostalgic, and Alexa by itself felt, for this film, too digital. We helped this by using vintage glass for the IMAX footage (Panavision H series) and newer, yet curated glass in the Ultra Vista Anamorphics, for all the non-imax work. Between the use of the large format digital camera, older glass, and a film out process performed by FotoKem, we achieved a look which was unlike anything we have shot before.

Given the strong mix of practical sets, real locations, and visual effects, this process allowed us to benefit from the positive elements of our smaller than normal digital cameras, yet retain an analogue quality to the lenses, backed up by the analogue quality of the film out. This, along with a strict adherence to accurate lighting in every scenario, helped integrate the visual effects into the live action photography.

Yeoman: Wes and I started using the Cooke S4's on ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and we loved the look and character of the lenses. We decided to continue using them on ""The French Dispatch"" and we again were very happy.

I started using the Arri Master Anamorphics a few years ago and I felt these would be perfect for our movie. Wes frequently fills the frame with actors, often on the edges, and we obviously wanted them to be in focus. Many of the more vintage anamorphic lenses are sharp in the middle but soft on the edges and I knew that this is not what we wanted. Again, I felt the Arri Master Anamorphics were the perfect choice.

Droz Palermo: We wanted the world of ""The Green Knight"" to feel wide and epic, yet intimate and immersive. Those goals are a little at odds, but the Alexa 65 allowed us to get close to our subjects without losing a sense of their place within a landscape. It was equally important that the film feel deeply subjective to our hero Gawain's emotional journey, and we employed lots of lighting and camera tricks to do that: rotating the camera 360 degrees and back again to glimpse a brutal death that could be, the sun breaking the horizon and filling a room at the end of a good deed, or something as down and dirt and simple as Vaseline on a vintage lens to peek into a hazy future.

D'Antonio: I found in the choice of the large format, and in particular of the Arri Signature, lenses that I used something that brought me even closer to the young Fabietto. That young man who later became the man I have known for a long time, a director with whom I have been working for many years, but above all a brother. Being next to him in this reckless and emotional journey required absolute respect, a mimetic attitude and a great lightness of mind. I liked that the image was rich in detail but that it had a softness, like a caress. I liked the idea that the human figure was in the foreground, that in the background many elements could be perceived but did not distract from emotion and thoughts of the characters on stage. I liked that the colors were discreet, that the diegetic movements and lights were descriptive of an emotion and that they supported emphasis or normality, making sure not to transfigure it.

""The Hand of God"" was a special job for me, in which more than usual I acted in total respect of the story without being protagonist, gracefully trying to accommodate a sweet and delicate course of events. I am happy to have been able to lay my gaze on such interesting and strongly symbolic human characters, on my city so beautiful and complex and above all on the wonderful women who populate the story. I am happy I was able to be young again, through Fabietto's gaze.

Mălaimare: The Panavision DXL2 is an incredibly versatile platform. The Red Monstro sensor and the Light Iron color science was the perfect combo for the color saturation we wanted to achieve. The 1.85x T series lenses provided us with incredible pleasant fall off, great flares, and amazing skin tone rendition. I remember Jeymes and I discussing very early on that this project has to be wide screen and definitely anamorphic. The anamorphic fall off will force you into framing the characters dead center and we embraced that entirely.

The Red Monstro was our compact camera, which allowed us to mount it on rifles, on Rufus' hand, cable cam, motorized sliders on the ceiling of the train car, and drone shots. We wanted to make a Western that sometimes pays tribute to the genre but we really wanted to make a new type of Western.

Bauman: To create the look of the '70s, the C Series anamorphic were an essential foundation for getting some of the classic looking '70s flares. Paul also has some of his own glass which we used, primarily an old 50mm Pathe. A huge inspiration for the look of the movie was George Lucas' ""American Graffiti"" which came out in the same year ""Licorice Pizza"" is set.

Louvart: We wanted to shoot with flexible tools. The Alexa Mini seemed like the right choice and we decided to use the Cooke S4 lenses which are very good at achieving a ""soft and nice"" skin tone - not too sharp. We wanted to shoot in Super 16mm but in fact digital became a good choice as well. We wanted to be close to the characters, to move with them, without using a zoom. And the flexibility of the camera was very important for Maggie to be able to get the moments with the children, with the adults, and the emotional aspect of the scenes. For the light we managed to organize some pre-light to be more flexible and ""ready to shoot"" without wasting time during the start of the day. The light was related to the mood of the characters, especially when we were shooting the memories of the main character, we could get more fantasy on it and also make a difference with the present.

Massaccesi: ""The Matrix"" has always been a movie that visually was advanced. ""The Matrix Resurrections"" was 20 years after the first one, things had changed in what the world was so we decided to find a new look, to create a Matrix reality that looked more real that the reality itself.

Laustsen: We wanted a very picturesque and moving camera, with deep shadows and single direct light sources, using the contrast and colors of the light with camera movements and wide angle lenses. To do this, I chose Alexa 65 as I think this camera has a good color balance. Its large sensor gives it a very small depth of field. Together with the Signature Prime Lenses we got this intense expression we wanted. However, the Alexa 65 and the Signature Prime Lenses give a very beautiful but sharp image, too sharp for this 1940 period film. We tried to put nylon stockings on the back of the lens like we did in the past but it didn't work. We ended up using a BPM (Black Pro Mist) 1/4 and 1/8 filter which was put on the back of the lens, inside the camera. The advantage of having a filter inside the camera is it doesn't affect the black level, but gives a highlight and gives faces a beautiful glow.

Sandgren: First of all, I like to have the look of the film already in the dailies. I like to use celluloid for two reasons 1. Because it expands my toolbox, where the look changes with the size of negative, the type of stock and processing and 2. Each frame is unique. Being analog appeals to me emotionally, because celluloid helps bring out the most subtle shades of color and enriches all colors but especially the skintones, which all works towards a great color depth and contrast. Often times I use the organic abilities within the celluloid, which just expands my palette to work with. What is interesting with celluloid is also that we can predict exactly how it will look, yet you will always be surprised how it actually looks. When being processed, the film itself has enhanced and made it a little more beautiful than we can imagine.

In ""No Time to Die,"" the main part of the film is shot in anamorphic 35mm, which we felt was the most epic of the 35mm formats and absolutely appropriate for action, thriller and adventure. It's also the format that helps bring out the most details, at the same time, has a beautiful bokeh which helps with the heightened reality and romantic moments. The reason for IMAX was to maximize the experience for the audience. The width of the film is full field of view in the theater and as we cut to IMAX 1.43:1 sequences, the image opens up below your feet and above your eyebrows and engulfs the audience in the film.

Grau: On a film about race and identity, shooting B&W was embedded as one of the main concepts of the movie. Every light and shadow (and every grey in between) was telling the story of our characters, was defining them. We also wanted every visual choice to enhance the story and for the look to be different than anything we had seen. After a lot of testing and searching for the right lenses, we felt in love with the Russian Lomo Anamorphic, because of their painterly quality, the overall dramatic softness and the poetic bokeh and dreamy highlights. They fulfill the world that we wanted to create. The boxy 4:3 aspect ratio helped represent the beehive that the characters were living in and made the characters the center, as the world outside is not as important as the way they see themselves.

Shooting anamorphic with 4:3 aspect ratio meant that we'd loose a lot of sensor, finishing on 1.7k of resolution (which is unheard of in a world obsessed with 4k and beyond) but after seeing it in the big screen we realize that it was really great for the movie and made it even more unique and bold. ""Passing"" was a contemporary film ""passing"" as 1920's. All the elements combined told the story in the way we dreamed of, helping the characters and honoring Nella Larsen's Harlem Renaissance novella and Rebecca Hall's contemporary vision.

Scola: The first step in developing the look for ""Pig"" was understanding tone of the film itself. There was something unique and beautiful in Michael's writing, it was always on the page, but it was difficult to articulate. To me, the film is sort of like a carnival goldfish in one of those cheap plastic bowls. To the fish, it's everything. Fear, danger, safety, loneliness, curiosity, death etc. A whole universe. To the human sat at the counter looking in, a tiny pot of water. This is how I rationalized ""Pig"" in my mind. Inside the film, the stakes, the choices, the emotion, everything is heightened. The look and feel of the film needed to make our audience feel every moment inside of the fishbowl, even if from the outside, it's seemingly safe.

With that in mind, I wanted to help bring a gravity to look of the film, while maintaining a certain level of playfulness without losing any of the humanity between these characters. Like the depth of a novel somehow dropped inside a kids storybook. Coincidently, I had bought a few children's books earlier that year because the art was interesting. When I opened them back up with ""Pig"" in mind, it started to take a real shape. I was chasing something that made reality seem far below us but grounded enough to believe every second of this film is happening somewhere.

Frontal element anamorphics have this ability to create a sort of false reality for me. When the lens goes up, the world takes shape differently, which really suited my ""storybook/novel "" thinking. So Mike Carter and Panavision Woodland Hills really helped me put FCC together a small collection of B and D series anamorphic mixed with a few spherical Panavision super / ultra speeds. I used diopters for large portions of the film to try and bring more intimate characteristics to the lenses. Particularly when we were chasing more vulnerable, human moments.

Wegner: When I'm shooting digital, the Alexa sensor is my go-to, it's such a reliable work horse - a very beautiful work horse. Going into such an ambitious project with extreme weather exteriors and low light interiors, I knew I needed a sensor whose technical limitations I was very familiar with, so I could push it right to the edge of its capabilities without going beyond. When paired with older lenses, a modern sensor I think is particularly beautiful. We chose the Ultra Panatars. Not only do they allow for beautiful landscapes in widescreen but also gorgeous rendition of faces, which precisely describes the two of the things that excite Jane and I the most: complex people in vast landscapes.

Daniels: Sean and I wanted to shoot on super 16 anamorphic because we both felt it was the absolute only way to make this film. It added an elegance and sophistication that helped offset the grittiness of the story and the locations. We were after a more classic 70s look with zooms, comedic whip pans, invisible dolly shots and elegant one'rs. We shot with Panavision super 16 lenses that were specially designed with a 1.44x squeeze factor to get 2.40 right out of the camera. There are only 2 sets in the world, and only 2 lenses in each set. Shooting the film this way, in addition to using spherical zooms and an Iscorama-54 anamorphic adapter in front of Zeiss Super Speeds really restricted our palette and forced our hands in certain creative choices that really make the film visually unique. I think super 16 anamorphic is an amazing way to retain all the texture and magic of film while adding the classic Hollywood feel that anamorphic delivers.

Morgenthau: I went with Anamorphics and the Alexa Mini LF because I felt it was a tool I could meld into the 3 distinct looks I was going for in ""Respect,"" all representing three major phases of Aretha's rise. 1. The 50s: A child singing Gospel in her father's Church, growing up around Gospel, R&B, Jazz, and the elite of black culture visiting her fathers home. 2. The 60s: Finding her voice and becoming an R&B mega star and leaving her fathers control in the Gospel world. 3. The 70s: Hitting rock bottom and finding solace in the Gospel Album and film ""Amazing Grace.""

16mm film recreated some of meta documentary moments, sort of a film within the film. The combination of the otherworldliness of the Anamorphic glass and the multiple looks and added ""Live Grain"" which created an elegant but truthful visual landscape to tell Aretha's story. The visuals evolved as Aretha's world evolved as staged by the director Liesl Tommy.

Mathon: The choice of celluloid film formats with low contrast and no saturated colors helped to give the fable side of the visual storytelling in ""Spencer"" a slightly haunted feeling. Pablo and I wanted a certain timelessness to be apparent with the film and for audiences to be unable to pinpoint exactly when this takes place. The choice of S16mm adds a smoothness to the image that, to my taste, contributes to the overall beauty and mystery of Diana's character. The subtle and rich rendering of colors (the greens, the reds) is an important aspect of Diana's world. The depth of S16mm increases the work on details and the use of short focal length lenses add to the feeling of isolation and imprisonment that we working to evoke throughout the film. We made the choice of celluloid film for aesthetic reasons but also for the lightness and the ergonomics of the S16mm equipment. The camera is constantly in motion, frequently gliding behind and circling around Diana. The work on the rhythm of the shots, the use of very short focal length lenses and close-up proximity to Kristen, are part of the mise-en-scene that Pablo envisioned to create tension and emotional intimacy with Diana.

Raedeker: ""Souvenir II"" is the story about a young film student finding herself in the shadow of a destructive relationship. As in ""Souvenir I,"" different shooting formats reflect on her personal journey and creative liberation, as well as the feel of the setting in the 80's. However, we wanted to keep the period look subliminal and made sure that it was subtle enough not to draw too much attention and divert from the characters. Changing formats and our different shooting styles felt like a dance with the content itself and in the final scene they both merge into one.

We shot most of it on 16mm film with inserts of student films and a musical number on 35mm color and 35mm anamorphic black and white film. We also filmed some passages on 16mm digital and 35mm digital, as well as interviews on Betacam and High 8. This created a colorful collage of the time and our heroine's character.

Because Joanna shoots chronologically, and without script or rehearsal, we sometimes employed two cameras to get more coverage for the edit. Many takes lasted as long as the freely improvised scenes were running and to keep performances fresh we did no repeats. Joanna's way of working was sometimes nerve wrecking, but on the other hand the lack of control taught me to trust the moment, become more observant and look closer, what's playing out in front of the camera. It's something I learned to cherish.

Ruhe: We wanted to pay homage to '70s filmmaking and used quite a lot of in picture zooms, sometimes to underline funny moments sometimes for drama. Our goal was to take you back to that time period. We also worked to make our film look like photographs from that time - a little bit in the vain of Ektachrome or Kodachrome photographs.

Brooks: Lin-Manuel Miranda, the director, and I wanted the New York City of 1990 to look and feel like each of us remembered it back then. We were both ten in 1990 when ""tick, tick...BOOM!"" begins. Our memory is from the view of a child where color and light and emotions are all heightened. The main character, Jonathan Larson, is childlike in many ways. We created our visual language from this childlike perspective where the lines between dreams and reality are blurred.

Lin and I were inspired by New York street photography. Panavision has always been a wonderful collaborator for me to find the right tools to tell a story. The special ""lens recipe"" we created combined with the large format camera allowed for an interesting mixture of techniques to create the feeling of aged, textured photography.

We wanted the viewer to get into Jonathan's head, including his internal contradictions, as he both struggles, and is inspired, to write his musical. We played with tight, claustrophobic, handheld shots with minimal depth of field to express Jonathan's overwhelming stress and pressure. But then we went to wide expansive shots to show Jonathan's dreams and moments of inspiration, such as in the musical numbers ""Swimming"" and ""Sunday.""

We were also inspired by 8 years of Betacam footage of Jonathan we found from the late 80s until his death. Instead of trying to recreate this look with modern technology, we filmed some shots with a real Betacam from the era. We tested many options and selected an old Betacam that the props department had. The first and last scenes of the film were shot this way, creating a nostalgic 1990s home video feel.

Impens: We wanted something, sharp and harsh and in your face. Little or no distortion - not romantic and soft - so modern lenses and a large format sensor helped to achieve this.

Delbonnel: I was looking for a modern black and white ""look"". The resolution and sharpness of the Alexa LF was exactly what I was looking for. Very crisp. And the Cooke S7 were giving me a roundness in the fall off which was perfect for the way I lit the all movie. A combination of very hard shadows and soft light in the background.

A movie is one interpretation of a story. A different director and a different cinematographer would have a different interpretation of the same script and it would be a different movie. Would it be better? Nobody knows. Would ""The Tragedy of Macbeth"" be better in color instead of black and white? I don't know. We just thought that Academy aspect ratio and black and white were a good way to support our first idea, which was: not fighting Shakespeare's language, be as ""abstract"" as possible, and finally create a rhythm with light and shadows.

Tuxen: Joachim and I believe that film is the best way to show human skin tones. Also, we love the whole process and discipline of the medium. We chose the Cooke 5/i lenses because I needed speed and we felt they added a slight softness without being nostalgic.","{'uri': 'indiewire.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'IndieWire'}","[{'uri': 'sarah_shachat@indiewire.com', 'name': 'Sarah Shachat', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ari-Wegner_Power-of-the-Dog_Cinematographer_1.jpg?w=780,0.3960784313725489,,False,0,0.3960784313725489,378922080,1

Picture: BLOOMBERG

Automakers have spent the past year announcing plans for electric vehicle models and production facilities. That makes 2022 a year when growing numbers of consumers will be weighing whether it's time to buy their first EV. Is it worth taking the plunge?

That probably depends on the price point and market segment you're considering. My view is that the higher your price point, the more you should think about buying an EV now rather than waiting another couple years. Here's a couple reasons why: First, automakers are launching their higher-end models before down-market ones, so the selection is better at the top end. There's also the tricky proposition of thinking through residual values for used vehicles in the future -- demand for gasoline-powered cars will be shrinking, so buying a new one now means it will be worth a lot less by the time you're ready to trade up.

It's important to keep in mind that much of consumer behaviour stems from automakers' actions. Manufacturers have got the message from investors that they'll be rewarded for accelerating the transition to electrics, while profits from gasoline-powered vehicles will serve mostly to fund those investments. The major automakers, following Tesla s lead, are starting with higher-end models both because that's where consumer demand is strongest and because it's easier to be profitable at higher price points while sales volumes remain far below gasoline vehicles.

Adding to temptation for consumers, industry tastemakers are giving these new, pricey EV models high marks. MotorTrend magazine named Rivian's $74,000 (R1.17m) R1T its truck of the year, and the even more expensive Lucid Air its car of the year. Both vehicles recently started consumer deliveries and have lengthy waiting lists.

Maybe you're impressed by what you've seen so far, but would rather wait a little longer until EV infrastructure like charging stations are more built out. But the value calculation for buying any new vehicle includes what it will be worth years later when you're ready to trade it in or sell it. The average length of time drivers hold onto new vehicles is six years. So if you're buying a new vehicle in 2022, you should be thinking about the market for used cars in 2028 or later.

The demographics of electric vehicle owners look a lot like Tesla CEO Elon Musk: on average, male, 40 to 55 years old, with an annual household income of more than $100,000. My colleague Nat Bullard recently posted some additional tables on EV buyer demographics. The percentage of new vehicles sold in the US that are electrics in 2022 might still be in the single digits, but for this demographic it will be well above that.

Looking out to 2028, when the overall market share of EVs in the US might be as high as 30%, the majority of affluent younger and middle-aged consumers might be purchasing electric cars and trucks. That's going to have a big impact on the value of used, gasoline-powered vehicles, with fewer buyers in every passing year.

While there might still be a robust market for used Honda Accords in 2028, it will probably be a more tenuous market for used gasoline-powered $40,000 sedans and sport utility vehicles as people in that segment switch over to EVs.

Meanwhile, though it's still early in its vehicle history, the market for used Tesla Model 3s has been robust. The cumulative impact of advertising campaigns shouldn't be overlooked either. Automakers aren't investing tens of billions of dollars into EVs only to have them sit in factories and dealer lots. They'll also use ad campaigns to make consumers believe that they're tech savvy, forward-thinking companies. By 2028, automakers will want affluent vehicle buyers to believe that gasoline-powered cars are as cool as floppy disks or having a landline -- the kind of thing your grandpa still has in his house.

What about cost? In a recent research note, Goldman Sachs pointed out that some segments of the EV market are already cost-competitive versus gasoline-powered vehicles after fuel and maintenance costs are factored in. Savings worked out to about $1,000 a year using a gasoline price per gallon of about $3, so buying a $60,000 EV breaks even compared with a $55,000 gasoline-powered vehicle after about five years.

And that's before taking tax incentives into account. It's hard to make a generalised point here because different states have different incentive levels, and at the national level an automaker like Tesla has used up its allotment of incentives while other automakers that haven't sold as many EVs to date still have some available. The proposed Build Back Better Act, currently stalled in the Senate, could include new incentives of $7,500 a vehicle or more, but we'll have to see in the new year whether that line item or the legislation as a whole becomes law. Still, even a scaled-down version of that proposal would make the financial rationale for buying an EV now much stronger.

A fair concern to have is the uncertainty surrounding the longevity and standards of the batteries that power electrics. Batteries do degrade somewhat over time -- a Tesla Model S battery loses 5% of its charging capacity after its first 50,000 miles -- but EV batteries are estimated to last between 10 and 20 years before needing to be replaced.

It's also possible that technological breakthroughs will lead to a fundamentally different kind of battery powering vehicles in the future. On some level it's weighing the uncertainty of changes in batteries against the certainty that the market for gasoline-powered vehicles will decline perpetually.

For utilitarian, budget-conscious car buyers, there's still reason to be confident that a new gasoline-powered vehicle bought in 2022 will retain a decent value in the used market towards the end of the decade. But for affluent consumers, it's less of a sure thing. Those high-end buyers who are thinking about waiting a little while longer to make their next vehicle an EV should consider going ahead with it in the new year.","{'uri': 'businesslive.co.za', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'BusinessLIVE'}",[],https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OGYCWQ0skyIyru23alM9HV5nlXgMeXdVvTJ2cFQMIlfmN0OYxko3FYTJCyrgqdI9jyWlPxYFNeS3OTC-vQZdV8--94nBTCmoOsvOozUP3FHmnA=s1000,0.3098039215686275,,True,0,0.3098039215686275,378918480,1

Bhiri, deputy president of the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, which President Kais Saied views as an enemy, was arrested by plainclothes officers Friday and his whereabouts were initially unknown. Ennahdha had played a central role in Tunisia politics until a power grab by President Kais Saied last year.

Tunisia was the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago, but civil society groups and Saied's opponents have expressed fear of a slide back to authoritarianism a decade after the revolution that toppled longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. On Sunday activists and a former Ennahdha legislator said Bhiri was in a critical condition and facing death.

But the source told AFP that Bhiri, 63, is ""not in critical condition for the time being"". The source, asking not to be named, told AFP that a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the United Nations rights commission visited Bhiri at hospital in the northern town of Bizerte on Sunday. He is ""lively and lucid"", and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward.

Since Friday, however, Bhiri has ""refused to take any food or medication, prompting his transfer to hospital"" two days later, the source said. Samir Dilou, a lawyer and ex-Ennahdha MP, condemned Bhiri's arrest as ""political"" and an abuse of the justice system.

'Kidnapping' charge

He told a Tunis news conference that he is lodging a ""kidnapping"" charge against Saied and Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine. Bhiri's wife, Saida Akremi, also a lawyer, told reporters he had suffered ""a heart attack"", and that she was being denied access to him because she refused to sign documents as demanded by security services. Mondher Ounissi, a doctor and member of Ennahdha's executive bureau, said Sunday that Bhiri suffers from several chronic illnesses, including diabetes and hypertension.

He has been ""deprived of his medication"" and ""his life is threatened"", Ounissi said, adding that Bhiri usually takes 16 pills a day. The interior ministry on Friday said that two individuals had been ordered under house arrest, without identifying them. It said the move was a ""preventive measure dictated by the need to preserve national security"".

The anti-torture group INPT has identified the second person detained as Fathi Baldi, a former interior ministry official.

Tesla's shares rose 6.7 percent in premarket trading after the company's quarterly deliveries exceeded Wall Street estimates, riding out global chip shortages as it ramped up production in China.

The company's record deliveries also boosted other companies in the electric vehicle sector including Lucid Group and Rivian Automotive, which added nearly 2 percent each.

Shares of oil majors Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. gained more than 1 percent each as crude prices rose on tight supply and hopes of a further demand recovery in 2022.

The S&P 500 energy index was the top sectoral performer in 2021 with a 47.7 percent rise -- its biggest yearly gain ever -- as surging oil prices turbo-charged corporate profits.

""But, we cannot replicate 2021 gains as we expect some curbs in corporate earnings growth.""

All of Wall Street's main indexes ended 2021 with monthly, quarterly, and annual gains, recording their biggest three-year advance since 1999.

The benchmark S&P 500 added 27 percent in 2021 and reported 70 record-high closes, its the second-most ever, in a tumultuous year hit by new COVID-19 variants and supply chain shortages.

The Dow added 18.7 percent for the year and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 21.4 percent.

Colorado Blvd. in Pasadena.

The space will incorporate an interior showroom displaying a maximum of two vehicles, according to plans submitted to the Department of Planning and Community Development. Within the showroom, company representatives can receive customers and discuss pricing, vehicle orders, and allow them to test Lucid Motors' driving experience with actual test drives or through virtual reality technology, the Planning Department said.

The report said the proposed office and showroom will be located within an existing three-story commercial building on the 4,386 square-foot site that's on the south side of W. Colorado Blvd. between Mills Place on the west and South Fair Oaks Ave. on the east, with Edwin Alley to the south.

Lucid Motors will occupy an existing 3,866 square-foot tenant space on the first floor that used to be occupied by a fastfood restaurant, according to the report. The office and showroom will be in operation from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday, the report added.

Customers intending to test drive the vehicles may use any of six Lucid Air vehicles that will be reserved for test drive use and parked at the City parking structure at 33 E. Green Street, according to the report.

""The Department of Transportation has determined that the parking structure has sufficient capacity to accommodate the vehicles and recommends a condition of approval that the business owner shall secure parking agreements with the City of Pasadena Parking Division prior to the issuance of any building permit,"" the Planning Department's report reads.

The Planning Department is recommending approval of the Minor CUP application, saying that the proposed sales office and showroom, classified as Vehicle Services-Sale and Leasing, Limited use, would be consistent with other existing uses in the vicinity.

""The project is in conformance with the purpose of the Zoning Code, for properties within the CD-1-AD-1 zoning district,"" the report said. ""In addition, the project is consistent with the goals and objectives of the General Plan. Based on staff's analysis of the requested addition, the vehicle sales use would remain compatible with the adjacent land uses and would not result in any adverse impacts to the surrounding area.""

Where Is the Rest of Wall Street?,"Citigroup is staying bullish on electric-vehicle startup Lucid to start the new year. Analyst resumed coverage of Lucid with and $57 price target.

Lucid (ticker: LCID) stock was up 1.6% in premarket trading. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose about 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.

Analysts can suspend coverage of a stock for a number of reasons, chief among them is a requirement to do so when the bank is working with the company on a large project. Citi wasn't immediately available to comment when asked about the reason for Michaeli's recent suspension.

But he's back and the $57 target price is the highest on Wall Street, according to Bloomberg and FactSet. Lucid targets are all over the place, ranging from about $16 to $57 a share.

That isn't much help to investors. The number of ratings doesn't help much either. There are only four people covering Lucid stock, according to Bloomberg. Two rate shares at Buy, one has a Hold rating and one a Sell.

Lucid stock, however, is valued at about $63 billion. A car company of that size should have 20-plus analysts covering the stock. Rivian Automotive (RIVN), another EV startup, has about 15 analysts .

Rivian, however, became publicly traded in a traditional initial public offering. Lucid went public via as SPAC merger. That can be one reason for the difference in coverage. Still, Lucid finished its merger months ago. It's a little odd, frankly, that so few have picked up coverage of a stock worth so much.

The $57 price target values Lucid at about at almost $100 billion. That would make it one of the most valuable car companies on the planet.

""We are constructive on the Lucid story and its position in the EV/Car of the Future theme,"" wrote the analyst in a report on Monday. He believes Lucid has industry leading range and charging performance as well as solid internally developed self-driving features.

Still, he notes that Lucid is pre-sales. The company is just on the cusp of delivering volume of its first luxury sedan, the Lucid Air, in 2022. For now, Michaeli prefers the potential of Lucid to the more established EV player Tesla (TSLA). Michaeli actually rates Tesla stock Sell. His recent Tesla target price was $262, valuing that stock at about $262 billion.

Bulls and insiders hope for a buy rating while bears and shorts root for the opposite.

Analyst initiations occur when a firm expands its research universe which can coincide with the addition of new analysts. Sometimes coverage begins simply because a new company has come to the public market.

As most stock rating changes involve upgrades or downgrades of existing positions, investors give special attention to initiations. Last week new coverage began for several names ahead of the new year. Here are three of the most intriguing.

Citigroup started covering Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) with a buy rating. The analyst gave the California-based electric vehicle manufacturer a $57 price target which equates to 50% upside based on Friday's close. The bullish sentiment from the well-regarded research group had a high impact on Lucid's share price rose 4.8% on the day of the initiation. The fresh coverage could spark a rally for a stock that went in reverse last month after climbing as high as $57.75 in November.

Lucid is trying to make a name for itself among an increasingly crowded field of traditional and upstart EV players. The company got a major boost when its first entrant, Lucid Air, was named 2022 MotorTrend Car of the Year beating out 24 competitors. The award coincided with a third quarter update that showed customer reservations grew to over 13,000 units which translates to an impressive $1.3 billion order book.

A few weeks later market enthusiasm towards Lucid Group was dampened by news of a new $1.75 billion debt offering. This was a natural reaction but an overdone one considering Lucid exited Q3 with a solid balance sheet that included $4.8 billion in cash. Once it starts booking revenue and bringing other vehicles to market, the debt concern should long be forgotten. With the Lucid Air starting at around $77,400, cash flow could pile up fast and send the stock into overdrive.

Last week Jeffries Financial Group became the latest sell-sider to call Grab (NASDAQ: GRAB) stock a buy. It marked a perfect five out of five analysts that have taken a bullish stance on the Southeast Asian superapp following its December 2 IPO. Grab's software platform includes delivery, mobility, and financial services for millions of people in Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and several neighboring countries.

Grab has quickly become a staple across the region where people depend on the app for food and grocery delivery, scooter and ride-share transportation, and for payments and investments. Analysts think the company itself is a good investment because of the growth expected across Southeast Asia and consumers' increasing adoption of convenient tech-enabled services.

While lockdown conditions have held the company back since last year, vaccination rates are improving, and economies are gradually reopening in the region leading to increased interest in the Grab app. In the mobility segment, volumes recovered strongly in the back half of 2021 giving the businesses much-needed momentum heading into the new year.

Jeffries' $10.50 price target suggests more than 40% upside and is one of the more conservative targets on the Street. Grab has penetrated only a small portion of Southeast Asia's online food delivery market and has its sights on the offline space through dine-in and takeaway order technology. With restaurants and businesses starting to come to life there, it may be a good time to grab some shares.

Coverage of Granite Construction (NYSE: GVA) was initiated at Sidoti last week. The sell-side analyst's buy rating and $50 price target had a high impact on a stock that hadn't received an analyst opinion since Goldman Sachs reiterated its sell rating (but raised its target to $37) back in early August.

Granite Construction is one of the biggest construction and materials companies in the country. It may also be one of the most undervalued plays on U.S. infrastructure spending given its diverse exposure to road construction, water projects, and alternative energy initiatives in the western U.S.. Analysts expect the company to more than double its earnings per share (EPS) to $2.04 in 2022 which makes its 19x forward P/E ratio well worth the price.

Besides the infrastructure exposure and valuation, Granite Construction's quarterly dividend makes it appealing. The 1.3% yield is modest but with approximately one-fourth of earnings distributed as dividends the road for dividend hikes remains long. With new bullish analyst coverage, building a position in Granite Construction may be a good move for small cap growth and income investors.","{'uri': 'pricetargets.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PriceTargets.com'}",[],https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/articles/small_Depositphotos_159763544_S.jpg,0.1215686274509804,,False,0,0.1215686274509804,378915480,11

Tesla's shares rose 6.7% in premarket trading after the company's quarterly deliveries exceeded Wall Street estimates, riding out global chip shortages as it ramped up production in China.

The company's record deliveries also boosted other companies in the electric vehicle sector including Lucid Group and Rivian Automotive, which added nearly 2% each. Chinese EV makers Nio and Xpeng (NYSE: XPEV ) gained 4.7% and 2.5% respectively following a jump in their deliveries.

The S&P 500 energy index was the top sectoral performer in 2021 with a 47.7% rise - its biggest yearly gain ever - as surging oil prices turbo-charged corporate profits.

That's why the Lucid Air is our Green Car Reports Best Car To Buy 2022.

Affordability, as part of a car that starts at $170,000 in its debut Dream Edition guise? Yes, and we'll explain why.

With an EPA-rated 520 miles, the Air sedan manages to beat the Tesla Model S in range and efficiency. It offers up to 1,111 hp, which exceeds the Plaid's 1,020 hp. And it can make shorter road-trip charging stops, with up to 300 miles restored in 20 minutes. Further, it presents a holistic reinterpretation of luxury and design that, even from the launchpad, is a formidable challenger to existing luxury brands.

It's also charming to drive, with a graceful and responsive character that matches the beautiful exterior -- seemingly influenced by aircraft and French design and offering what might be the best-ever take on a long, low, cab-forward style. The bright, welcoming interior feels premium in the sense of Volvo or DS, and you can sprawl out in the seats, front or back, a proof point for how much space you can free up in a clean-slate design that frees itself of what Lucid design VP Derek Jenkins has called ""legacy thinking.""

The Lucid Air alone easily offered enough game-changing aspects to earn a place as one of our Best Car To Buy finalists, which also included the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Mercedes-Benz EQS, Rivian R1T, and Volkswagen ID.4.

A big part of our award has always rested on the potential of a model to spur Big Change. Whether that's by selling a lot of efficient vehicles, by disrupting a segment, or by providing game-changing technology moments, all of our previous winners express one or more of those core values extraordinarily well.

Among this cohort, the Rivian R1T is the segment disruptor, and it's our close runner-up, in a choice that was not unanimous among our editors. As the genesis for off-road-focused electric trucks, with mass-market appeal, the R1T beats the Tesla Cybertruck and Ford F-150 Lightning to market, and it does so with a cohesive brand vision. Much like Tesla did with the Model S when we chose that, it sold us on the viability of the format, with a near flawless electric truck that will, like Tesla, eat into premium-priced truck market share -- and in this case, Jeep, Toyota, Land Rover, and others, if they don't move fast to electrify.

At face value, the Air is not a volume entry -- although more affordable versions with more than 400 miles of range are coming in the next year, starting as low as $77,400. For Lucid, the Air is the company's statement of purpose, the shiny, must-have object that got the company funded, got revenue flowing, and gave the company the best chance of being viable. It doesn't exactly disrupt its segment like the original Tesla Model S, but it's the technology within that's a potentially game-changing moment for the industry. The compact, power-dense motors, proprietary inverter technology, and space-efficient battery packs are all ready to scale into much higher-volume models -- perhaps for other automakers, and for its own future energy storage business.

Lucid started as a battery company and has supplied the pack that powered Formula E racing for three seasons. And yet unlike Tesla and Rivian it doesn't aspire to build its own cells.

If cells are the commodity, it's what Lucid does with that commodity that's its ace in the market.

Peter Rawlinson, Lucid's CEO and CFO, who a decade ago was the chief engineer of the Model S, doesn't like the idea of ""off-the-shelf"" components for electric vehicles, and believes that Lucid's strengths lie in the harmony of it all -- the design, packaging, performance, and extraordinary work prioritizing efficiency in the Air.

All the work on the harmonious whole shows in the Air. Rawlinson teases that what might be seen as a sort of ""engineering purist play"" may prove fruitful in the end, as production ramps up and the same harmonious approach is applied to subsequent vehicles, each higher-volume. The Gravity SUV will be enabled by a Phase 2 expansion at its Casa Grande, Arizona plant within the next year or two, then a third step including a Tesla Model 3/Y-sized vehicle and expansion up to 365,000 units annually will come later in the decade. A pickup and coupe are also in the plan by 2030.

The steadfastness of Rawlinson's focus on efficiency -- and Lucid's continued development on its core component set through financial difficulties -- has led to what we see as a top-notch result that could be applied to millions of more affordable vehicles over the long run.

Lucid is essentially betting on a future in which the vehicles that can smartly do the most with the least energy are the winners. And if you can afford a vehicle like the Air, we'd encourage you to do the same. Given our focus at Green Car Reports, that's what makes Lucid a winner.","{'uri': 'greencarreports.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Green Car Reports'}","[{'uri': 'bengt_halvorson@greencarreports.com', 'name': 'Bengt Halvorson', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://images.hgmsites.net/hug/2022-lucid-air_100819711_h.jpg,0.3803921568627451,eng-7381244,False,0.7372549176216125,0.3803921568627451,378913680,19

But entering 2022, the industry may stage a battle for hegemony. In Europe, Volkswagen began to challenge Tesla's leading position. In the United States, ""MotorTrend"" magazine awarded two heavyweight automotive awards to the products of two start-up companies-Rivian's R1T and Lucid Motors' Air.

In addition, Toyota Motor Japan announced that it will invest 35 billion U.S. dollars to produce 30 different models of pure electric vehicles by 2030. Nissan also pledged in November to invest nearly US$18 billion by the end of 2030. US Consumer News and Business Channel (CNBC) predicts that the following 11 electric models will become global hot products, and even have the opportunity to challenge Tesla's dominance.

The electric pickup F-150 Lightning will be launched in the spring of 2022. Ford hopes to gain a stable foothold in the electric pickup market through this model. As the most popular vehicle in the United States, Ford's F-150 series has often occupied the best-selling car in the United States. Relying on this unparalleled popularity, Lightning has become one of the most anticipated vehicles on the market ever. The F-150 Lightning has a starting price of nearly $40,000, and it will be able to travel 300 miles and reach 563 horsepower with extended-range batteries. At the beginning of December last year, the company's CEO Jim Farley told the media that due to excess demand, Ford had to stop booking after the first 200,000 orders.

Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of Tesla and the richest man in the world, said that he got inspiration from the movies ""Blade Runner"" and ""007 Underwater City"", creating the futuristic appearance of Cybertruck. The model was supposed to be put on the market before the end of 2021, but due to various production delays, Tesla has repeatedly postponed the date. Musk predicted that Cybertruck will start production at the end of 2022 at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in October last year, and mass deliveries may begin in 2023. This means that Cybertruck may lag behind Ford, GM, and Rivian in the date of market entry.

Bhiri, deputy president of the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, which President Kais Saied views as an enemy, was arrested by plainclothes officers Friday and his whereabouts were initially unknown.

Ennahdha had played a central role in Tunisia politics until a power grab by President Kais Saied last year.

Tunisia was the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago, but civil society groups and Saied's opponents have expressed fear of a slide back to authoritarianism a decade after the revolution that toppled longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

On Sunday activists and a former Ennahda legislator said Bhiri was in a critical condition and facing death.

But the source told AFP that Bhiri, 63, is ""not in critical condition for the time being"".

The source, asking not to be named, told AFP that a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the United Nations rights commission visited Bhiri at hospital in the northern town of Bizerte on Sunday.

He is ""lively and lucid"", and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward.

But since Friday Bhiri has ""refused to take any food or medication, prompting his transfer to hospital"", the source said.

Mondher Ounissi, a doctor and member of Ennahdha's executive bureau, said on Sunday that Bhiri suffers from several chronic illnesses, including diabetes and hypertension.

He has been ""deprived of his medication"" and ""his life is threatened"", Ounissi told a news conference, adding that Bhiri usually takes 16 pills a day.

The interior ministry on Friday said that two individuals had been ordered under house arrest, without identifying them. It said the move was a ""preventive measure dictated by the need to preserve national security.""

The president ""bears full responsibility for the life of Mr Bhiri"", the anti-Saied group ""Citizens against the coup"" said Sunday on Twitter.

It said he had been ""rushed to the hospital in a very serious condition"".

Saied on July 25 sacked the Ennahdha-supported government and suspended parliament, presenting himself as the ultimate interpreter of the constitution.

He later took steps to rule by decree, and in early December vowed to press on with reforms to the political system.","{'uri': 'naharnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Naharnet'}",[],http://images0.naharnet.com/images/245106/w140.jpg?1641215775,-0.1058823529411764,,True,0,-0.1058823529411764,378913140,1

It's so well done as not only an EV, but also a lifestyle choice, that it earns the title of Motor Authority Best Car To Buy 2022.

The R1T is not only our first electric winner, but also the first pickup to win the award. It's the most versatile vehicle we've ever driven, and no other vehicle on the market matches its breadth of capability and performance.

The R1T squared off with some stiff competition from a variety of segments, including EVs, luxury cars, and sports cars. The closest electric competitor was the Lucid Air, which impressed the team with its power, styling, long range, and charging capabilities. The Mercedes-Benz EQS also appealed as the first car to bring traditional luxury to the EV segment.

The Rivian also bested gas-powered competitors. The BMW M3 and M4, Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing, and Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing all appealed as luxury sport sedans with track prowess. We like the fun and feel the Hyundai Elantra N brings to the compact sedan segment, and we were taken with the Volkswagen hot hatch GTI and Golf R duo, which mature this time around while still delivering sharp moves teamed with utility.

The Rivian won us over with its Wrangler-like enthusiast appeal, lightning-quick acceleration (0-60 mph in just 3.0 seconds), the rally stage fun of its Rally mode, and its innovative packaging and utility. Stats like 835 hp and more than 300 miles of range didn't hurt either. Every team member who got behind the wheel of the R1T walked away impressed by the cohesive package Rivian created.

In just under three years, the Rivian R1T went from being unveiled to rolling off the assembly line. That's an impressive feat for any brand, let alone a startup automaker, especially considering it happened during a pandemic that constrained supply chains.

Every R1T is powered by four electric motors (two per axle) to make 415 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque at the front axle, and 420 hp and 495 lb-ft at the rear axle; together, the output is rated at 835 hp and 908 lb-ft of torque. That's supercar territory. The electric motors are fed by a 135-kw battery pack that Rivian dubs ""the large pack."" A smaller 105-kw pack and a larger 180-kw ""Max Pack"" will come in time.

Rivian's claimed 3.0-second 0-60 mph time (increasing to 3.2 seconds on all-terrain tires), makes the R1T quicker than the Ford F-150 Raptor, Ram 1500 TRX, and every other production pickup truck on the planet. The truck lunges forward despite the fact it weighs about 7,000 lb, which classifies it as a heavy-duty truck. For reference, the heaviest production light-duty pickup is the Ram 1500 TRX, which is absurdly heavy at 6,350 lb. But the R1T doesn't ride or drive like a heavy-duty pickup.

The magic comes from a sophisticated suspension that uses air springs, adaptive dampers, and a hydraulic control system (rather than anti-roll bars) similar to what's found in a McLaren supercar. The system uses two fluid lines between the front wheels, and a T line runs to the back and connects the rear wheels. When you turn hard to the right and the body rolls to the left, the fluid limits the compression on the left side to even it out and balance lateral motion. The result is remarkably little body roll, especially given all that mass. The R1T has a comfortable, composed ride, too, whether its pushed on all-terrain tires around tight corners on wet pavement or while bombing down a gravel road in pouring rain.

With multiple drive modes, and separate settings for the dampers, stability control, and air suspension, there are nearly 50 ways to configure how the R1T drives, though the All-Purpose mode is a good catch-all setup for those who don't want to tinker. We became quite partial to the R1T's Rally mode while doing donuts in the mud and going sideways on washed-out gravel roads. Rally mode increases throttle sensitivity and loosens the stability control's reins to let the truck go sideways. Unfortunately, it also lowers the engagement point for the brakes, making pedal travel too long for our liking.

Off-road, the Rivian presents a wild, and somewhat eerie, experience. It's easier to connect with what's happening under the vehicle when you can hear the sounds of rocks crunching under the tires and the suspension reacting to obstacles. Rolling over bumpy, rocky terrain without having to worry about low-hanging bits like oil pans and mufflers builds confidence. Without the need to lock any differentials, engage low-range gearing, or activate hill descent control, the driver can simply focus on navigating the terrain.

It can do truck stuff, too. The R1T's rated to tow up to 11,000 lb and haul up to 1,760 lb of payload (not at the same time), and it has a built-in air compressor with a max output of 150 psi to inflate tires after airing down for off-road adventures

At a time when every pickup this side of the Tesla Cybertruck looks similar, the Rivian is cut from its own cloth without looking like it was designed by a child or for some futuristic movie. It's a four-door crew cab sized more like a Honda Ridgeline than an F-150, and it comes with a 54.0-inch bed and light bars that span the width of the front and rear ends. A retractable, power tonneau cover comes standard, along with under bed storage and an 11.0 cubic-foot frunk that has a false floor to hide cargo. The R1T's killer app, however, is the gear tunnel mounted behind the cab; it offers 11.6 cubic feet of water-tight storage and is capable of holding up to 300 lb of gear. A slide-out camp kitchen is an option to fill the gear tunnel for those looking to adventure into the wilderness. The gear tunnel's access doors each feature small storage compartments that can hold the air compressor hose or a first aid kit.

It's hard to find faults with the R1T. Early units we tested exhibited some touchscreen lag, but that's seemingly been fixed based on our most recent testing. The truck's 7,000 lb curb weight is kind of absurd, and it's not even close to being the most efficient EV despite over 300 miles of EPA-rated range. It has no glovebox, though it boasts plenty of interior storage. It also lacks Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and neither are currently in the plans. These are small faults and we have no larger concerns, other than trepidation about Rivian's ability to meet demand as a startup.

Starting from $67,500 the R1T certainly isn't cheap, though it's a much better value than Wranglers with similar or higher prices. The Rivian R1T allows enthusiasts to choose both utility and performance as the new electric era begins. Standout design, innovative packaging, unreal performance, and useful utility clinched the win for the Rivian R1T to become the Motor Authority Best Car To Buy 2022.","{'uri': 'motorauthority.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Motor Authority'}","[{'uri': 'joel_feder@motorauthority.com', 'name': 'Joel Feder', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://images.hgmsites.net/hug/2022-rivian-r1t_100819538_h.jpg,0.2784313725490195,eng-7380498,False,0.658823549747467,0.2784313725490195,378912360,1

In 1824, a nine-year-old boy named Katsugoro, the son of a Japanese farmer told his sister that he believed he had a past life. According to his story, which is one of the earliest cases of past life recall on record, the boy vividly recalled that he had been the son of another farmer in another village and had died from the effects of smallpox in 1810. Katsugoro could remember dozens of specific events about his past life, including details about his family and the village where they lived, even though Katsugoro had never been there. He even remembered the time of his death, his burial and the time he spent before being reborn. The facts he related were subsequently verified by an investigation.

Past life recall is one of the fascinating areas of unexplained human phenomena. As yet, science has been unable to prove or disprove its genuineness. Even many who have investigated claims of past life recall are unsure whether it is a historical recollection due to reincarnation or is a construction of information somehow received by the subconscious. Either possibility is remarkable. And like many areas of the paranormal, there is a propensity for fraud that the serious investigator must watch out for. It's important to be skeptical about such extraordinary claims, but the stories are nonetheless intriguing.

Past life recall generally comes about spontaneously, more often with children than adults. Those who support the idea of reincarnation believe this is because children are closer to their past lives and that their minds have not been clouded or ""written over"" by their present lives. Adults who experience past life recall often do so as the result of some extraordinary experience, such as hypnosis, lucid dreaming or even a blow to the head.

Here are some outstanding cases:

Perhaps the most famous case of past life recall is that of Virginia Tighe who recalled her past life as Bridey Murphy. Virginia was the wife of a Virginia businessman in Pueblo, Colorado. While under hypnosis in 1952, she told Morey Bernstein, her therapist, that over 100 years ago she was an Irish woman named Bridget Murphy who went by the nickname of Bridey. During their sessions together, Bernstein marveled at detailed conversations with Bridey, who spoke with a pronounced Irish brogue and spoke extensively of her life in 19th century Ireland. When Bernstein published his book about the case, The Search for Bridey Murphy in 1956, it became famous around the world and sparked an excited interest in the possibility of reincarnation.

Over six sessions, Virginia revealed many details about Bridey's life, including her birth date in 1798, her childhood amid a Protestant family in the city of Cork, her marriage to Sean Brian Joseph McCarthy and even her own death at the age of 60 in 1858. As Bridey, she provided numerous specifics, such as names, dates, places, events, shops, and songs - things Virginia was always surprised about when she awoke from the hypnosis. But could these details be verified? The results of many investigations were mixed. Much of what Bridey said was consistent with the time and place, and it seemed inconceivable that someone who had never been to Ireland could provide so many details with such confidence.

However, journalists could find no historical record of Bridey Murphy - not her birth, her family, her marriage, nor her death. Believers supposed that this was merely due to the poor record keeping of the time. But critics discovered inconsistencies in Bridey's speech and also learned that Virginia had grown up near - and had known well - an Irish woman named Bridle Corkell and that she was quite likely the inspiration for ""Bridey Murphy."" There are flaws with this theory, too, however, keeping the case of Bridey Murphy an intriguing mystery.

In 1986, a woman known by the pseudonym ""Monica"" underwent hypnosis by psychotherapist Dr. Garrett Oppenheim. Monica believed she discovered a previous existence as a man named John Ralph Wainwright who lived in the southwestern U.S. She knew that John grew up in Wisconsin, Arizona and had vague memories of brothers and sisters. As a young man, he became a deputy sheriff and married the daughter of a bank president. According to Monica's ""memory,"" John was killed in the line of duty - shot by three men he had once sent to jail - and died on July 7, 1907.

Born in Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon), Sujith was barely old enough to speak when he began to tell his family of a previous life as a man named Sammy. Sammy, he said, had lived eight miles to the south in the village of Gorakana. Sujith told of Sammy's life as a railroad worker and as a dealer of a bootleg whiskey called arrack. After an argument with his wife, Maggie, Sammy stormed out of his house and got drunk, and while walking along a busy highway was struck by a truck and killed. Young Sujith often demanded to be taken to Gorakana and had an abnormal taste for cigarettes and arrack.

Sjuth's family had never been to Gorakana and hadn't known anyone that fit Sammy's description, yet, being Buddhists, were believers in reincarnation and therefore not completely surprised by the boy's story. Investigations, including one conducted by a professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia, confirmed as many as 60 of the details of the life of Sammy Fernando who indeed had lived and died (six months before Sujith's birth) just as Sujith had said. When Sujith was introduced to Sammy's family, he surprised them with his familiarity with them and his knowledge of their pet names. This is one of the strongest cases of reincarnation on record.

Hypnosis isn't the only method by which past lives are recalled. A Britsh woman was distressed by a recurring dream in which she, as a child, and another child with whom she was playing, fell from a high gallery in their home to their deaths. She vividly remembered the black and white checked marble floor on which they died. She repeated the dream to several of her friends. Sometime later, the woman was visiting an old house that had a reputation for being haunted. With its black and white marble floor, the house immediately was recognized by the woman as the scene of the deaths in her dreams. She subsequently learned that a small brother and sister really had fallen to their deaths in the house. Was she recalling a past life, or had she somehow psychically tuned into this dramatic history?

These are just a few of the more well-known examples of past life recall. Those who practice past life regression therapy today claim that it has certain benefits. They say it can shed light on present life personal issues and relationships and can even help to heal the wounds suffered in a past life.

Reincarnation has also been one of the central tenets of many Eastern religions, and one can return to this existence in a new physical form, whether it is human, animal or even vegetable. The form one takes, it is believed, is determined by the law of karma - that the higher or lower form one takes is due to one's behavior in the previous life. The concept of past lives is also one of the beliefs of L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology, which states that ""past lives are suppressed by the painfulness of the memory of those former existences. To restore the memory of one's whole existence, it is necessary to bring one up to being able to confront such experiences.""","{'uri': 'liveabout.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'LiveAbout'}",[],"https://www.liveabout.com/thmb/fzNylEW6s2XyDswV-s4B6RytXm0=/1800x1204/filters:fill(auto,1)/gi-hypnosis-pocketwatch-56afb6713df78cf772c7be5d.jpg",-0.02745098039215688,,False,0,-0.02745098039215688,378911280,1

Some stocks, at times, get much higher attention and interest than others from investors and analysts alike. Frequently, such stocks are from a hot sector, like electric vehicles (EVs) right now. But should you buy a stock just because it is hot?

Let's discuss three EV stocks that are getting a lot of love from Wall Street, and if they are attractive buys right now or not.

Probably no other car company has captured investors' attention in the way Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) did in the last few years. That got reflected in a steep rise in Tesla's stock price -- from less than $5 in 2010 to more than $1,000 right now. That's a rise of more than 20,000% in roughly 11 years. Interestingly, the stock rose more than 1,000% in just the last two years. The rate of growth in Tesla's stock price fell in 2021, when the stock rose just around 52%.

But the question that is at the top of investors' minds right now is whether the stock still makes an attractive buy. There are probably two key factors that may drive Tesla's stock price up from here on. First, if the company manages to grow its EV deliveries, at the margin it is currently generating, the stock could see steady gains in the coming years. These will not likely be of the magnitude seen in the past.

Second, Tesla stock could see substantial gains if the company manages to bring better full self-driving features to the market than the competition. The company could potentially disrupt other segments, such as auto insurance, using custom premium rates based on driver data gathered by it. Notably, these are all possibilities, and may not turn into a reality.

On the flip side, Tesla stock looks priced for perfection. With rising competition, the road ahead for the company isn't entirely smooth. Any deviation from expectations may send the stock's price downward. But all said, Wall Street's love for the stock doesn't seem unreasonable.

Another EV stock that has garnered tons of attention from Wall Street is Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN). The electric vehicle manufacturer has delivered fewer than 400 vehicles so far. Yet, the stock is trading at a market capitalization of more than $90 billion. There are quite a few things that investors like about Rivian. To begin with, it is the first company to launch an electric pickup truck. It beat the likes of General Motors, Ford, and Tesla to launch an electric truck.

What's more, the company's truck got positive reviews from users and media. Its pickup truck was selected as MotorTrend's 2022 Truck of the Year. In addition to the pickup truck, the company started deliveries of its first SUV in December. Rivian has received more than 71,000 pre-orders for its truck and SUV combined, indicating a strong consumer interest in its vehicles.

Finally, the company is backed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which owns a roughly 20% stake in Rivian. Additionally, Amazon has agreed to buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian. So, Rivian has some good products and ready buyers. All it now needs to do is start delivering the EVs.

Though promising, the valuation of Rivian stock looks substantially rich. Investors might want to let the story play out before deciding to buy Rivian stock.

Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) rose to prominence when it successfully delivered its first car, the Lucid Air, with a longer range than that of any other electric car in the market. At its top trim, the car offers a range of 520 miles -- about 100 miles more than Tesla's Model S. Lucid's experience in batteries that power the world's premier EV racing series came in handy when delivering superior performance. The Lucid Air also bagged the 2022 MotorTrend Car of the Year award.

Lucid plans to deliver 20,000 vehicles in 2022. Beyond that, Lucid has laid out its growth plans systematically. The company plans to launch the Grand Touring, Touring, and Pure versions of the Lucid Air in 2022. In 2023, it intends to launch its SUV called Gravity. Moreover, the company plans to enter the European and Middle Eastern markets in 2022.

Lucid's solid products and its clear growth plans make its stock attractive. However, investors should note that the company still has a long way to go before it starts delivering cars profitably.","{'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}","[{'uri': 'rekha_khandelwal@fool.com', 'name': 'Rekha Khandelwal', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/659490/tesla-modelx.jpg,0.2078431372549019,eng-7380498,False,0.6235294342041016,0.2078431372549019,378910920,14

The Dream Edition of its flagship luxury sedan, the Air, starts at $169,000. CEO Peter Rawlinson says that's just for now -- and that he'll soon crack the $25,000 range.

One of the biggest barriers to mass adoption of electric vehicles is cost. EVs might not reach cost parity with gas-powered cars until 2025, McKinsey estimated. So companies like Tesla and nascent industry players like Lucid Motors are racing to make their cars more affordable for the mass market.

Lucid has a ways to go. The Dream Edition of its flagship luxury sedan, the Air, starts at $169,000. But it's a necessary step in the startup's goal to build a more affordable EV, CEO Peter Rawlinson said. Unlike legacy automakers working to boost the range of their EVs, Lucid plans to do the opposite: Go from the longest-range vehicle in the world to one with the smallest (and most affordable) battery.

""Lexus did it. Tesla did it,"" Rawlinson told Insider this summer. ""Great brands have started with a high-end product and gradually made that more accessible.""

Bhiri, deputy president of the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, which President Kais Saied views as an enemy, was arrested by plainclothes officers Friday and his whereabouts were initially unknown.

Ennahdha had played a central role in Tunisia politics until a power grab by President Kais Saied last year.

Tunisia was the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago, but civil society groups and Saied's opponents have expressed fear of a slide back to authoritarianism a decade after the revolution that toppled longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

On Sunday activists and a former Ennahda legislator said Bhiri was in a critical condition and facing death.

But the source told AFP that Bhiri, 63, is ""not in critical condition for the time being"".

The source, asking not to be named, told AFP that a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the United Nations rights commission visited Bhiri at hospital in the northern town of Bizerte on Sunday.

He is ""lively and lucid"", and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward.

Senior Ennahdha politician Noureddin Bhiri, pictured in 2012, is not in critical condition ""for the time being"" after his detention, a source said Photo: AFP / Fethi Belaid

But since Friday Bhiri has ""refused to take any food or medication, prompting his transfer to hospital"", the source said.

Mondher Ounissi, a doctor and member of Ennahdha's executive bureau, said on Sunday that Bhiri suffers from several chronic illnesses, including diabetes and hypertension.

He has been ""deprived of his medication"" and ""his life is threatened"", Ounissi told a news conference, adding that Bhiri usually takes 16 pills a day.

The interior ministry on Friday said that two individuals had been ordered under house arrest, without identifying them. It said the move was a ""preventive measure dictated by the need to preserve national security"".

The president ""bears full responsibility for the life of Mr Bhiri"", the anti-Saied group ""Citizens against the coup"" said Sunday on Twitter.

It said he had been ""rushed to the hospital in a very serious condition"".

Saied on July 25 sacked the Ennahdha-supported government and suspended parliament, presenting himself as the ultimate interpreter of the constitution.

He later took steps to rule by decree, and in early December vowed to press on with reforms to the political system.","{'uri': 'ibtimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'International Business Times'}",[],https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2022/01/03/senior-ennahdha-politician-noureddin-bhiri-pictured-in-2012.jpg,-0.1058823529411764,eng-7377822,False,0.8823529481887817,-0.1058823529411764,378909180,1

NASDAQ:LCID closed out an eventful first year on the public markets on Friday, even though investors may not have seen the type of growth they were initially hoping for. The year to date returns for the stock have been good if you managed to buy in before the SPAC merger with Churchill Capital was completed in July. Since then, the stock has performed admirably, gaining about 32% in the back half of the year. While Lucid hasn't immediately become the threat to EV industry leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) that some were hoping for, the company has a legitimate product on the roads which is more than what can be said for other EV makers who went public via a SPAC merger.

Stay up to speed with hot stocks' news!

Electric vehicle stocks struggled during the final session of 2021, ahead of the much anticipated December delivery figures for Chinese companies, and the fourth quarter deliveries for Tesla. Shares of Tesla were down by 1.27% on Friday, while recently public Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) managed to eke out a small gain of 0.26%. In the Chinese market, Nio (NYSE:NIO) dipped lower after a major surge on Thursday, while domestic rivals XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) both closed the day higher.

For Tesla, it has been a forgettable end to the year. Just one day after the company announced a recall of 475,000 vehicles, there was a report out of China that Tesla will be recalling a further 200,000 vehicles in the Asian market as well. While recalls have been a non-issue for Tesla in the past, it might give investors some pause as the EV maker scales its production capacity on a global level.","{'uri': 'fxstreet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'FXStreet'}",[],https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/TechnicalAnalysis/ChartPatterns/Chartism/stock-market-chart-79297425_Large.jpg,0.1607843137254903,eng-7377007,False,0.47843137383461,0.1607843137254903,378908760,1

A quarter-century of peace has effaced many of the bitter sectarian divides of the three decades-long Troubles.

But to understand how important identity remains, just watch Northern Ireland's football team before an international. Some players belt out ""God Save the Queen"" with gusto. Others listen in silence to an anthem they do not consider represents them.

Football was partitioned along with the island of Ireland in 1921. But a long-simmering debate over whether a new anthem is needed is just one way the UK region is struggling to deal with the emblems of its twin identities.

In December, four years after its initial deadline, an official commission published a report on emblems and other cultural expressions of identity.

""In the conflictual politics in our society,"" it noted, wryly, ""we seem to spend an inordinate amount of time discussing flags, symbols, bonfires, statues, murals, banners and memorials"".

Take flags. The commission considered whether public buildings should either fly only the union jack, since Northern Ireland is part of the UK, or the Irish flag as well to honour both Irishness and Britishness together -- a compromise would be to fly the union jack only on certain days or have a no-flags-at-all policy.

As for other, similar issues -- the reason the £800,000, 168-page report is likely to gather dust on a shelf -- the commission concluded that ""there is currently no meeting point"".

Ironically, Ireland's tricolour is supposed to represent both communities -- the green of the Catholics, orange for Protestants, and white symbolising peace.

But even colour-coding can be complicated. The Northern Ireland football team plays at the Windsor Park stadium, in a traditionally unionist area, wearing a strip in the colour -- green -- traditionally associated with the Irish Republic. At the start of my Ireland posting last summer, I must subconsciously have been hedging my bets when, without calculating, I took along an orange jacket and a green dress to a conference.

Sinn Féin, the republican party, which is now the most popular in Ireland both north and south, wants a vote on reunification in five to 10 years. Polls in Northern Ireland suggest the popular mood is less sure -- its population can already decide to identify as British, or Irish, or both. But Brexit may be shaping opinions.

In order to avoid having a hard border on the island, the post-Brexit trade rules known as the Northern Ireland protocol drew a customs line down the Irish Sea, leaving Northern Ireland within the EU's customs union.

A Lucid Talk poll in Northern Ireland in November found 36 per cent of respondents would ditch the protocol, reunite with the Republic of Ireland and return to full EU membership, versus 30 per cent who wanted to stay British even if that meant a land border with the Republic.

On the other hand, a survey in December by conservative peer and pollster Lord Ashcroft found 54 per cent favoured staying part of the UK against 46 per cent who opposed, once undecided votes were removed. But it also found that 67 per cent thought Brexit had made Irish reunification more likely.

In the Republic, nearly three-quarters of people embrace the idea of a reunited Ireland -- as long as it doesn't happen now and they don't have to pay more taxes or change their flag and anthem, according to an Ipsos MRBI poll for the Irish Times. Even among Sinn Féin voters, only just over a third of respondents saw Irish unification as a priority.

Addressing an Irish government forum on its ""shared island"" programme, Northern Irish comedian Patrick Kielty summed it up: ""The vast majority of people in the north no longer look at things through a binary prism. They're getting on with their lives -- and each other,"" he said. ""Is it a love-in? No. Is it united? Definitely not. But you know too often on this island we get fixated with the notion of being united -- remaining part of the UK, becoming part of a united Ireland . . . This island is never going to be united, and that's OK.""

Take, for instance, how an old manager of mine used to ask my advice on business strategy in our weekly 1:1s - and then provide constructive feedback on it.

While I might not have recognized it at the time, I now see he was teaching me to think about how my role fit into the company's bigger mission.

Or, consider how my current manager seeks out learning and development opportunities for each of her direct reports. Whenever she finds a workshop or online class that could help me grow, she passes along the information.

All of which is to say: Good leadership doesn't look, sound, or act just one way. There are a myriad of ways for a good leader to educate and inspire others.

Which means leadership is a harder skill to master than others. It isn't like mastering Excel, which requires knowledge of specific, fixed formulas. Instead, good leadership is more ambiguous, and mastering it is less of a linear path. There will be setbacks, and moments where you feel you didn't act as a good leader should. But there will also be incremental moments of true growth.

Whether you're an individual contributor or already a team lead, there's always room for improvement. Here, we'll cover leadership development on various levels - from individual contributor to senior management and above. Plus, hear leadership tips from Google, LinkedIn, Monday.com, and HubSpot.

We'll also explore how to achieve your career goals through actionable steps you can take to level-up and become a stronger, more effective leader.

Let's begin.

What is a leader? The Skills, Traits, & Qualities of Good Leadership How to Achieve Your Leadership Career Goals Why Goal Setting is a Critical Component of Good Leadership Expert Tips on Effective Leadership What is a leader?

Before we dive into how to become a leader, it's important we cover what a leader is.

At its most basic definition, a leader is someone who leads a group of people towards a common goal through inspiration, motivation, and strong vision setting.

For instance, a teacher leads her students towards the goal of learning and uses motivation and inspiration to help them reach that goal.

The motivation and inspiration aspects are key. A leader isn't just someone who barks orders and hopes people obey. Instead, an effective leader is highly emotionally intelligent and connects with his or her direct reports to create stronger relationships before driving the group towards change.

Additionally, a good leader is someone who is effective at big-picture strategizing, and equally adept at communicating that vision to the rest of the team.

If you're still unsure what a leader is, here are a few quotes from leaders who've defined the term for themselves:

""As a business leader, I think of myself as a coach. It's my responsibility to build a strong team, design a winning strategy and execute the strategy with excellence to bring the team to victory."" - Thasunda Duckett, President and CEO of TIAA ""Ensuring that people have everything they need to achieve the missions of an organization. That's it, all else is footnotes."" - Hans Vestburg, CEO, Verizon Communications ""Leadership is helping believe in a better tomorrow or a better outcome than you have today."" - Marissa Mayer, Former CEO, Yahoo! ""Leadership is helping people succeed, inspiring and uniting people behind a common purpose and then being accountable."" - Paul Polman, Former CEO, Unilever ""A leader is someone who can think strategically, simplify the strategy so everyone in the organization can understand it and communicate that strategy simply, enthusiastically, and in a caring way."" - Ajay Banga, CEO, MasterCard

Now that we've covered a more broad, basic definition, let's explore some skills, traits, and qualities of good leadership to understand the definition on a more actionable level.

The Skills, Traits, & Qualities of Good Leadership

Good leadership looks different for every leader. Some leaders are quiet and calm; others are rambunctious and extroverted. There isn't a specific personality that lends itself best to effective leadership. And that's a good thing - at its core, leadership is about leading people, and people are diverse, so you want your leadership teams to reflect that diversity.

However, there are a few specific skills, traits, and qualities that have been identified as strong indicators of good leadership.

A few high-level leadership skills include:

High emotional intelligence A growth mindset Strong communication skills Reliability Ability to give and receive feedback Decisiveness

To learn more about leadership skills (and how to improve them), take a look at What Are Leadership Skills? [+ How To Get Them].

For now, let's explore which skills are most relevant for various leadership roles.

Leadership as an Individual Contributor

You don't have to manage a team to be a leader. Instead, many individual contributors are strong leaders who need to develop leadership skills to manage projects or outcomes.

As an individual contributor, it is oftentimes your responsibility to have influence across the organization to drive projects across the finish line. This includes having the confidence to convince stakeholders that what you're doing matters to the organization, and that you're the best leader for the job.

Some of the most critical skills of an individual contributor include strong communication skills, time management skills, ability to work autonomously, and ability to collaborate effectively.

Here are a few specific examples of how individual contributors might need to demonstrate leadership skills:

A social media marketer spearheading a new campaign across channels. A website designer who is in charge of re-designing the new company homepage. A blogger who notices a gap in an existing editorial strategy and wants to pitch a new topic cluster to leadership. A product marketer who needs to work with various teams to drive traffic and leads to a new product launch.

All of these employees need strong leadership skills - including the ability to empathize, remain flexible, listen actively to other team's agendas, and communicate their own vision effectively - and yet, none of them lead a team in a traditional sense.

To develop leadership skills as an individual contributor:

Learn to seek out feedback from the employees with which you work. Once one project is complete, ask them to complete a survey that requests information related to your time management skills, communication skills, or collaboration skills.

Leadership as a Manager

Once you're a manager, developing leadership skills becomes more a practice of trial-and-error.

To develop or strengthen key leadership skills, you'll want to request regular feedback from each of your direct reports, as well as your manager, to determine areas for improvement. Ask clear, actionable questions such as, 'What is one thing you'd like me to start doing? (Specific examples are helpful)' and 'What is one thing you'd like me to stop doing? (Specific examples are helpful)'.

Additionally, take the time to reflect on situations to determine how you might shift your behavior moving forward. Good leaders are the first to admit their mistakes.

For instance, if you're managing an entry-level employee and recognize you didn't give her enough context or support before suggesting she meet with her first client, you'll want to reflect and decide how you'll change moving forward.

Then, in your 1:1, you can tell her: ""I apologize for pushing you into a client situation without ensuring you had all the context and information you needed to succeed. Moving forward, I've altered our team training schedule to ensure employees have more time to find their footing before meeting with a client.""

Finally, as you move into a manager role, take the time to identify your management style. Understanding your management style can help you uncover inherent strengths (and weaknesses), and expand upon those.

To develop leadership skills as a manager:

Ask your direct reports for candid, honest feedback. Reflect on situations and iterate on your behaviors over time. Finally, identify your management style and be self-aware about your areas for improvement.

Leadership as a Senior Manager and Above

When you become a senior manager, your job shifts significantly - because you're now leading a team of managers.

To be effective as a senior manager, you'll want to ensure you know how to ask the right questions. In skip level meetings, for instance, you might be speaking with employees who feel intimidated and hesitant to point out issues they're seeing on the ground-level - but their perspective is invaluable for spotting weaknesses within the organization.

Skip level meetings can also help you determine which areas your direct reports might need coaching, as well as patterns of challenges and inefficiencies across the team.

As a senior manager, it's also your responsibility to identify and nurture future leaders. Seek out opportunities to coach and mentor lower level leaders to ensure your organization is prepped with leaders who can drive positive change.

Finally, a senior leader is someone who motivates and inspires the department at-large with visions of the future of the company - two, five, and even ten years out. She is someone who is able to clearly articulate where she sees the business, and industry, headed, to create a sense of purpose among employees.

To foster this skill as a senior manager, you'll want to be intentional about staying up-to-date with the competitive landscape and consistently making note of existing customer pain points and how your company might reduce friction and stay relevant in the years to come.

To learn more about this, take a look at How to Set & Achieve Marketing Objectives in 2021.

To develop leadership skills as a senior manager or above:

Practice the art of active listening and asking the right questions to discover weaknesses and gaps in your organization. Keep up-to-date with the competitive landscape. Find mentors or senior manager peers who will provide you with leadership feedback, and attend conferences or seminars to network with other industry leaders.

How to Achieve Your Leadership Career Goals 1. Identify your leadership style, and know your strengths and weaknesses.

Leadership isn't one-size, fits-all. So when you first decide you want to become a leader, it's vital you take the time to determine what type of leader you want to be.

If you've never been in a leadership position before, you can start by taking a leadership style assessment to determine your style.

Alternatively, if you have been a leader in a previous position (even informally), take a look at The 8 Most Common Leadership Styles & How to Find Your Own [Quiz] to see which style you feel you fit most accurately.

For instance, let's say you've determined you fit a 'Coach-Style Leadership' style. Coach-Style leaders are focused on identifying and nurturing individual strengths of each team member.

Since Coach-Style leaders focus on growth and success of individual employees, it's vital you're efficient at communication and relationship-building.

Alternatively, if you felt better suited for a 'Strategic Leadership' style, you'd want to hone skills related to strategic, big-picture thinking.

Once you've figured out your leadership style, it becomes easier to identify areas for improvement and areas of potential weakness.

To create a more comprehensive list, take the time to make a list of your strengths and weaknesses (and collect external feedback as well) - this can help you determine, with your manager, which areas of growth will be most necessary before you can earn a leadership position.

2. Seek out opportunities to become a role model or mentor.

To become a leader, you'll need to vocalize to your manager that you want to become one. Then, he or she can help you identify opportunities to begin practicing leadership informally.

Alternatively, try seeking out those opportunities for yourself. There are a myriad of ways to test out your leadership skills. Perhaps you sign up to become a mentor to a new employee, or grab coffee once a week with a new team member to provide guidance and support.

Outside of work, you can look for areas in your community to become a leader. For instance, you could volunteer as a mentor for a local high school.

3. Develop your communication skills.

A core tenant of strong leadership is good communication skills.

Leadership requires you to communicate constantly with various stakeholders, effectively sell them on your goals or vision, and create rapport to build trust among your team.

In a given day, a leader might go from a meeting with executives in which she needs to communicate the resourcing needs of her team, to a meeting with individual contributors where she needs to build trust, inspire, and motivate.

All of which is to say: Good leadership and strong communication skills go hand-in-hand.

To develop stronger communication skills, you'll want to start by practicing your active listening skills, learning how to assert your opinion in a helpful way, and asking for feedback from others on your existing communication skills. You might also seek out public speaking opportunities to strengthen your public speaking skills.

Empathy and emotional intelligence are equally critical to communicating effectively, and can help you build stronger relationships with colleagues.

For instance, let's say a colleague comes to you with a problem. She expresses that she's been overwhelmed and, as a result, won't be able to meet the deadline you'd initially agreed upon for a project.

While you might be frustrated or even angry initially, empathy can enable you to put yourself in her shoes, and understand that missing deadlines can happen to all of us. Additionally, emotional intelligence can help you monitor your own emotions and react appropriately.

As a result of having empathy and high emotional intelligence, you might respond like this: ""Thanks for letting me know, and I'm sorry to hear you've been feeling overwhelmed. We've all been there. Give me some time to think over how we can come up with a solution to ensure we don't get behind on the project as a whole.""

Rather than reacting purely based on personal feelings, emotional intelligence ensures you have the skills to keep your emotions in-check and respond to situations in positive, effective ways.

4. Ask big picture questions and learn to think about strategy.

When asked, ""What skills are vital to being a good leader?"", over ⅓ of HubSpot survey respondents reported 'ability to think strategically and to think about the big picture'. That skill alone won out over communication skills, decision-making skills, and interpersonal skills.

Thinking strategically doesn't happen overnight. When you're in a role that requires you to be focused on ground level details, it can be difficult to suddenly pull back and analyze bigger trends, challenges, and solutions - but it's vital for any leader to be able to do so.

Here are a few ways you can begin exercising that 'strategic thinking' muscle:

Ask more big picture questions in meetings, even if it's not directly tied to your role. For instance, if you're a social media marketer and you're required to post Instagram stories for an upcoming product launch, you might explore questions such as, 'Why did our executive team choose to focus on investing in development for this product in particular?' 'How will this product expand our value proposition?' and 'What narrative are we telling around this product and how it fits into our existing product stack?' Expand your network outside of your immediate team. Grab lunches with members of the sales or services organization, and take the time to speak with those outside of your team. This will help you begin to understand what's happening in other areas of the organization, what other teams are working on, and challenges other teams are facing. Get organized with how you spend your time. While your day-to-day tasks are important, it's equally vital you carve out intentional time to focus on bigger projects or professional development opportunities. To do this, you might block off one hour every other week to focus on personal brainstorming - during this time, you might write down a list of higher-visibility projects you've been wanting to test out, or seek out workshops and courses in your area that will help you develop skills that your team currently lacks. Be willing to speak up. Beyond asking question in meetings, practice feeling comfortable sharing your own perspective or opinion. Show your colleagues you're willing to communicate new ideas or get creative when it comes to existing strategies.

5. Take on more responsibility.

To begin levelling up in your career, you'll need to seek out additional opportunities to expand your skillset and demonstrate your willingness to grow professionally.

The easiest way to do this is to have an honest conversation with your manager in which you ask where the team's needs are, and how you can help your team meet those needs. Alternatively, perhaps you've observed a weak spot on your team and you feel confident you know how to fix it - in that case, you might bring your proposal to your manager.

It's vital you have buy-in from your manager since taking on more responsibility outside of your existing role could look unprofessional if your manager doesn't know why you're adding tasks to your plate.

If you're interested in becoming a team manager, for instance, you might tell your manager: ""I noticed we're hiring a summer intern. If we don't already have a plan in-place, I'm wondering if I could become the intern's mentor or manager for the summer to strengthen some of my leadership skills?""

6. Go where the needs are.

I received this advice early in my career after I'd pitched a lengthy project to my manager. The pitch was strong - except my solution didn't solve a big problem, it solved a small one.

My manager said, ""It looks like you created this pitch with your own personal interests top-of-mind. While it's always great if your passions can match business need, first and foremost, you need to work from the perspective of, 'What will help our business the most?'""

She had a point. After some reflection, I realized our team didn't need infographics designed for blog posts as much as the team needed more SEO knowledge and input. Rather than looking for design courses, I pivoted and signed up for a workshop on SEO. It was less interesting (personally), but it impacted our business on a broader scale.

Effective leaders don't just suggest random ideas when it suits them. Instead, they start by asking the right questions and analyzing existing weak spots. Then, they work to fill in those gaps and create real change for their organizations.

7. Practice self-awareness.

Self-awareness is an incredibly vital skill for any leader.

For instance, leaders who can see how their employees view them are usually more effective, and have stronger relationships with their employees. Additionally, self-awareness can help you correctly identify what you do well, and which areas you can potentially improve.

But if you think you're already a master in self-awareness, think again. One study estimates only 10-15% of people are truly self-aware. And, even if you are self-aware, there is always opportunities to strengthen the skill.

In this context of developing leadership skills, self-awareness can help you:

Assess your current relationships with your colleagues, and how you might improve it. (Example: You recognize you were dismissive of another colleague's ideas in a recent meeting, and she's been avoiding you since. With that self-awareness, you can apologize for your behavior and practice more open-mindedness moving forward.) Analyze your own internal thought patterns, and recognize which ones aren't serving you, to build confidence. (Example: You feel imposter syndrome every time you present to your team, and you're self-aware enough to know it's because you're constantly thinking, 'I don't deserve to be here'. As a result, you work on self-affirmation, and create a folder on your desktop of positive reinforcements from colleagues.) Figure out which skills you lack that you'll need to develop before moving into a leadership role. (Example: After some reflection, you realize you aren't often honest about your mistakes, which can make you seem untrustworthy. As a result, you put effort into admitting when you've failed to your manager or team.) 8. Take the time for quiet reflection.

Becoming an effective leader doesn't happen overnight. And, unfortunately, there's no 'end' to becoming a good leader. For your entire leadership journey, you'll continuously iterate and grow.

When setbacks and failure happens, it's important you become adept at reflection. As you put these leadership tips into practice, take the time to regularly assess how you're doing. Leadership is trial-and-error, and as you practice new behaviors to grow your leadership skills, you'll want to determine which feel most authentic to you.

Ultimately, good leadership doesn't mean mirroring what others have done. It means figuring out what works for your personality and style, and expanding on those innate qualities. Since authentic leadership is the single strongest predictor of an employee's job satisfaction, it's imperative you take the time to grow into a leader in the way that's right for you.

Why Goal Setting Is a Critical Component of Good Leadership

As you move into a leadership role, you might feel pulled in many different directions by stakeholders with different goals.

This is why setting goals is vital for leading a team successfully: It keeps you focused on what matters for your team.

When you create goals for your team, you're effectively prioritizing what you will say yes (and no) to over a given period. Additionally, you're ensuring your team clearly knows where they're headed and how to get there - an essential component of good leadership.

Here are a few other reasons goal setting is a critical component of good leadership:

Goal setting helps you enable your employees to work more autonomously. If they know what results you're expecting from them, it doesn't necessarily matter when, where, or how they reach those. Goal setting helps you stay focused on what matters most for your business. It ensures you don't get distracted with quick wins, and instead remain fixated on long-term success. Goal setting can spark more engagement from employees. If your employees understand the purpose and long-term vision behind their daily tasks, they'll likely feel more motivated. Goal setting increases a team's creativity and collaboration. Once you've decided where your team is headed, you don't necessarily need to dictate how to get there. Instead, empower your employees to brainstorm and test out interesting strategies to drive the team forward towards that goal. It's more interesting - and likely more effective - to gather unique perspectives when driving towards a common goal. It helps you know when to say no. When your employees come to you with interesting projects or experiments, it can be tempting to say yes. By setting clear team goals, you're ensuring each team member uses their time intentionally in pursuit of that goal alone.

When setting goals, consider using a SMART framework to ensure your goals are clear, actionable, and specific.

The Eisenhower Matrix can also help you figure out which tasks are highest priority once you've determined your team's short and long-term goals. The Eisenhower Matrix enables you to categorize your tasks in order of urgency and importance.

Now that we've covered goal setting as a vital component of leadership, let's explore a few other critical factors according to Google, LinkedIn, Monday.com, and HubSpot.

What Makes an Effective Leader? Tips from Google, LinkedIn, Monday.com, and HubSpot 1. Effective leadership is humbling.

Anders Mortensen, Google's Managing Director of Channel Partners, says effective leadership is humbling.

He told me, ""In my early years of leadership, I was focused on the what - the results - while my team was focused on the how. It took me six years to realize that you don't define your leadership success, it's defined by others, and the how matters more than the what.""

Mortensen adds that he believes your definition of team will either limit leaders, or elevate them.

""To become an effective leader,"" Mortensen says, ""you have to make people around you better. Success is collaborative and your definition of 'team' will either limit you, or elevate you.""

""The broader you define 'team', the more holistically you'll lead, and you'll become the bridge-builder that solves for the entire company, versus optimizing for just your own.""

Ultimately, being a good leader means more than delivering exceptional results. It also means consistently motivating and supporting your team - through the highs, but also through the lows.

2. Effective leaders show compassion and encourage authenticity.

Alyssa Merwin, Vice President of LinkedIn Sales Solutions, told me compassion is a key characteristic of effective leaders.

As Merwin puts it, ""For many reasons, employees may struggle to show up as their full selves at work, creating barriers for them to be successful in certain parts of their roles. Whether because of caregiving responsibilities, mental health concerns, being part of an underrepresented group, or any other number of factors that make them feel different from the broader group, employees may experience increased stress of showing up to their desks - or Zoom, these days - on top of the pressure to perform in their roles.""

Employees desire the opportunity to show up as their authentic selves at work, which is a critical factor for long-term employee satisfaction and engagement.

Merwin says, ""To truly support their teams, it's imperative that leaders not only recognize that these challenges may exist for some team members, but that they also commit to integrating diversity, inclusion, and belonging into their day-to-day operations.""

""Creating and enabling great cultures and welcoming environments is just the starting point,"" Merwin adds.

""Effective leaders focus on how each individual team member is feeling and showing up to work, and they facilitate safe spaces for open discussion about how team members can better support one another.""

3. An effective leader is someone who walks side-by-side with their team.

Effective leaders are able to provide strong, actionable support and guidance for their team.

As Hila Levy-Loya, VP of Customer Success at monday.com, told me, ""Being an effective leader is about choosing to walk side-by-side with your team - not forging ahead and looking back to check where they are.""

Being able to walk side-by-side, Levy-Loya adds, requires you to take the time to have deeper conversations with your team and understand their daily activities. ""The first step in achieving this is to take the time to understand the details of your team's work and what keeps them up at night. Get to know their day-to-day responsibilities and stresses, and in turn you will become trusted to lead an informed discussion with your team.""

Along with discussing your team's responsibilities, you'll want to remain transparent about the bigger picture - including your long-term vision and goals.

Levy-Loya says, ""The second step is granting your team access into your motivations so they can understand your 'zoomed out' view just as you do. Sharing the good, the bad, and the unknown creates an environment of trust and transparency that is crucial to achieving incredible results. With that ability to tap into each others perspectives, you and your team are able to pave the way together.""

4. An effective leader always assumes good intent.

Lisa Toner, HubSpot's Director of Content Network, told me effective leaders always assume good intent, even when a team member makes a mistake.

As she puts it, ""No one sets out to make a bad decision or mistake. When it happens, they're likely going to be more upset about it than you are, so no matter how frustrated you are, approach the issue with empathy, and calmly and supportively lead your team member towards a better outcome.""

""Always assume good intent,"" Toner adds. ""Reacting negatively will only knock their confidence in themselves - and you - in the long run.""

Ultimately, good leadership doesn't happen overnight. To become an effective leader, you'll want to consistently request honest, candid feedback from your direct reports, and practice self-awareness to recognize - and improve - your leadership weaknesses.

Fortunately, your direct reports don't expect you to be perfect; they expect you to be human. Be humble, admit when you don't know, and collaborate with your team to leverage each person's expertise - all of which will bring you that much closer to truly leading effectively.

Bhiri, deputy president of the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, which President Kais Saied views as an enemy, was arrested by plainclothes officers Friday and his whereabouts were initially unknown.

Ennahdha had played a central role in Tunisia politics until a power grab by President Kais Saied last year.

Tunisia was the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago, but civil society groups and Saied's opponents have expressed fear of a slide back to authoritarianism a decade after the revolution that toppled longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

On Sunday activists and a former Ennahda legislator said Bhiri was in a critical condition and facing death.

But the source told AFP that Bhiri, 63, is ""not in critical condition for the time being"".

The source, asking not to be named, told AFP that a joint team from Tunisia's independent anti-torture group INPT and the United Nations rights commission visited Bhiri at hospital in the northern town of Bizerte on Sunday.

He is ""lively and lucid"", and being kept under close observation in a private room of the hospital's cardiology ward.

But since Friday Bhiri has ""refused to take any food or medication, prompting his transfer to hospital"", the source said.

Mondher Ounissi, a doctor and member of Ennahdha's executive bureau, said on Sunday that Bhiri suffers from several chronic illnesses, including diabetes and hypertension.

He has been ""deprived of his medication"" and ""his life is threatened"", Ounissi told a news conference, adding that Bhiri usually takes 16 pills a day.

The interior ministry on Friday said that two individuals had been ordered under house arrest, without identifying them. It said the move was a ""preventive measure dictated by the need to preserve national security"".

The president ""bears full responsibility for the life of Mr Bhiri"", the anti-Saied group ""Citizens against the coup"" said Sunday on Twitter.

It said he had been ""rushed to the hospital in a very serious condition"".

Saied on July 25 sacked the Ennahdha-supported government and suspended parliament, presenting himself as the ultimate interpreter of the constitution.

He later took steps to rule by decree, and in early December vowed to press on with reforms to the political system.","{'uri': 'today.rtl.lu', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'RTL Today'}",[],https://static.rtl.lu/rtl2008.lu/nt/p/2022/01/03/12/d677e6dce8dee3f57553403403ee2ff0.jpeg,-0.1058823529411764,eng-7377822,False,0.8509804010391235,-0.1058823529411764,378907980,1

Indigo Technologies, an automotive OEM delivering an entirely new class of smooth, roomy and affordable electric vehicles (EVs), is introducing two new vehicle designs aimed at the rideshare and delivery market - Indigo FLOW™ and FLOW PLUS™- at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Indigo's breakthrough robotic wheels enable new types of EVs that ride significantly smoother, are more spacious and operate at lower cost than any other vehicles in their class. The FLOW and FLOW PLUS will be markedly better in all of these attributes compared to the Toyota Rav4 and the Ford Transit Connect, respectively. Both FLOW and FLOW PLUS will provide more than 250 miles of range with only a 40kWh battery.

With explosive growth for on-demand deliveries and rideshare, and with companies like Uber and Amazon joining the Climate Pledge, providing efficient and capable EVs that drivers can afford is an imperative. heavy EVs are too inefficient and expensive for gig drivers, but reducing mass to save costs has meant sacrificing space and comfort due to conventional propulsion and suspension technologies.

""Indigo invented robotic wheels that uniquely enable more space and comfort for small urban EVs,"" says Will Graylin, CEO of Indigo. ""Without the transmission and motor between the wheels, Indigo FLOW has a low, flat floor that provides more cargo space than any vehicle of its size. And the active suspension in each wheel makes for an amazing ride comfort at an affordable price that people will love.""

Automakers have spent the past year announcing plans for electric vehicle models and production facilities. That makes 2022 a year when growing numbers of consumers will be weighing whether it's time to buy their first EV. Is it worth taking the plunge?

That probably depends on the price point and market segment you're considering. My view is that the higher your price point, the more you should think about buying an EV now rather than waiting another couple years. Here's a couple reasons why: First, automakers are launching their higher-end models before down-market ones, so the selection is better at the top end. There's also the tricky proposition of thinking through residual values for used vehicles in the future -- demand for gasoline-powered cars will be shrinking, so buying a new one now means it will be worth a lot less by the time you're ready to trade up.

It's important to keep in mind that much of consumer behavior stems from automakers' actions. Manufacturers have gotten the message from investors that they'll be rewarded for accelerating the transition to electrics, while profits from gasoline-powered vehicles will serve mostly to fund those investments. The major automakers, following Tesla Inc.'s lead, are starting with higher-end models both because that's where consumer demand is strongest and because it's easier to be profitable at higher price points while sales volumes remain far below gasoline vehicles.

Adding to temptation for consumers, industry tastemakers are giving these new, pricey EV models high marks. MotorTrend magazine named Rivian's $74,000 R1T its truck of the year, and the even more expensive Lucid Air its car of the year. Both vehicles recently started consumer deliveries and have lengthy waiting lists.

Maybe you're impressed by what you've seen so far, but would rather wait a little longer until EV infrastructure like charging stations are more built out. But the value calculation for buying any new vehicle includes what it will be worth years later when you're ready to trade it in or sell it. The average length of time drivers hold onto new vehicles is 6 years. So if you're buying a new vehicle in 2022, you should be thinking about the market for used cars in 2028 or later.

The demographics of electric vehicle owners look a lot like Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk: on average, male, 40 to 55 years old, with an annual household income of more than $100,000. My colleague Nat Bullard recently posted some additional tables on EV buyer demographics. The percentage of new vehicles sold in the U.S. that are electrics in 2022 might still be in the single digits, but for this demographic it will be well above that.

Looking out to 2028, when the overall market share of EVs in the U.S. might be as high as 30%, the majority of affluent younger and middle-aged consumers might be purchasing electric cars and trucks. That's going to have a big impact on the value of used, gasoline-powered vehicles, with fewer buyers in every passing year.

While there might still be a robust market for used Honda Accords in 2028, it will probably be a more tenuous market for used gasoline-powered $40,000 sedans and sport utility vehicles as people in that segment switch over to EVs.

Meanwhile, though it's still early in its vehicle history, the market for used Tesla Model 3's has been robust. The cumulative impact of advertising campaigns shouldn't be overlooked either. Automakers aren't investing tens of billions of dollars into EVs only to have them sit in factories and dealer lots. They'll also use ad campaigns to make consumers believe that they're tech savvy, forward-thinking companies. By 2028, automakers will want affluent vehicle buyers to believe that gasoline-powered cars are as cool as floppy disks or having a landline -- the kind of thing your grandpa still has in his house.

What about cost? In a recent research note, Goldman Sachs pointed out that some segments of the EV market are already cost-competitive versus gasoline-powered vehicles after fuel and maintenance costs are factored in. Savings worked out to around $1,000 a year using a gasoline price per gallon of around $3, so buying a $60,000 EV breaks even compared with a $55,000 gasoline-powered vehicle after about five years.

And that's before taking tax incentives into account. It's hard to make a generalized point here because different states have different incentive levels, and at the national level an automaker like Tesla has used up its allotment of incentives while other automakers that haven't sold as many EVs to date still have some available. The proposed Build Back Better Act, currently stalled in the Senate, could include new incentives of $7,500 a vehicle or more, but we'll have to see in the new year whether that line item or the legislation as a whole becomes law. Still, even a scaled-down version of that proposal would make the financial rationale for buying an EV now much stronger.

A fair concern to have is the uncertainty surrounding the longevity and standards of the batteries that power electrics. Batteries do degrade somewhat over time -- a Tesla Model S battery loses 5% of its charging capacity after its first 50,000 miles -- but EV batteries are estimated to last between 10 and 20 years before needing to be replaced.

It's also possible that technological breakthroughs will lead to a fundamentally different kind of battery powering vehicles in the future. On some level it's weighing the uncertainty of changes in batteries against the certainty that the market for gasoline-powered vehicles will decline perpetually.

For utilitarian, budget-conscious car buyers, there's still reason to be confident that a new gasoline-powered vehicle bought in 2022 will retain a decent value in the used market towards the end of the decade. But for affluent consumers, it's less of a sure thing. Those high-end buyers who are thinking about waiting a little while longer to make their next vehicle an EV should consider going ahead with it in the new year.","{'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}","[{'uri': 'conor_sen@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Conor Sen', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iBVNrtj6AU8M/v0/1200x901.jpg,0.3019607843137255,eng-7378627,False,0.5215686559677124,0.3019607843137255,378907380,1

He was aged 101.

According to his son in law, Carey Ngini, the Duke of Kabeteshire had been ailing since 2020, coupled with old age.

""Over the course of last year and this year, he'd been battling one ailment or another, very well despite his age,"" Ngini told KTN News at the Kariokor where Njonjo's body was cremated 3 hours after he died at his Muthaiga home at 5am on Sunday.

The family said the cremation was accoriding to his will.

""As of this morning (Sunday, January 2), at around 5:15am, he breathed his last. It was actually as a result of a little bout of pneumonia, which he suffered. Pneumonia had compromised his lungs. His passing was peaceful. He was surrounded by his family members,"" Ngini said.

Recalling his last conversation with him, Ngini said, ""As late as last night, we'd had some interesting conversations together. He was lucid, his memory was clear, but he was unwell and he was weak.""

President Uhuru Kenyatta who led Kenyans in mourning Njonjo, the last member of the independence Cabinet described him as a ""selfless leader"" who gave his all in serving the nation.

""The passing away of Hon. Njonjo is a big blow not only to his immediate family, friends and relatives but to all Kenyans and indeed, the entire African continent because of his leading role in the founding of the Kenyan nation at independence,"" President Kenyatta said in a dispatch from State House.

Njonjo, who hails from Kabete in the outskirts of the capital Nairobi, was known for his English mannerisms and eloquence entrenched in Britain where he undertook studies and lived for some time before coming back to Kenya and subsequently taking up the AG's job.

Family members crammed into her mother's house.

It didn't take much to bring together an extended circle of relatives. After all, everyone lived on nearby blocks and was able to join celebrations, pitch in when someone needed help and keep an eye out for one another.

In the diaspora after Hurricane Katrina, things have changed. Though many have returned - with some, like Perkins, only making it back to the city a decade or more after the flood - many others have not, straining the social and family networks that once stitched the city together.

Perkins' daughters now live in Baton Rouge and Houston, far from the city that had been the family's North Star for generations. The networks that served as a source of joy and protection now often connect only remotely, even before the pandemic made such accommodations common.

""Now everybody's scattered. We're doing conference calls,"" Perkins said. ""We're not linking up, holding hands. You don't have the camaraderie anymore, you don't have the sense of home.""

A decade and a half after the levees failed and the city flooded, 384,000 people lived in New Orleans, according to the latest census figures.

That's 40,000 more residents than the city had in 2010, a population bump prompted by the long tail of the recovery and a sudden influx of newcomers drawn to a city that looms large in the nation's cultural imagination.

But it's less than the city had in the middle part of the decade. And it leaves New Orleans with less than 80% of its pre-Katrina population, a presumably permanent gap of at least 100,000 people who never were able to make it back in a demographic shift that cut deeply into the city's Black majority.

With strong indications that its population is once again settling into the stagnation or slow decline that had defined it for a half-century, New Orleans finds itself at an existential crossroads. Reversing the slide, experts say, will mean building an economy beyond the often low-wage tourism jobs that now dominate and solving a housing crisis that has kept many from being able to afford to live in the city.

""These kinds of trends, you can't turn them around in a year. They take longer-term vision and implementation and commitment to a forward-looking vision,"" said Allison Plyer, chief demographer for The Data Center.

A patchwork recovery

There is no single reason the recovery petered out with the city still so much smaller. Some of the displaced may have found personal or professional reasons to stay in the places they left for. But for many, the challenges of returning were immense.

There were the inequities in how the Road Home program valued properties, which forced many homeowners to sell to the government because the payouts wouldn't cover their repairs. Even for those who were able to renovate, there was difficulty in managing it from afar.

Too, some areas of the city were hit harder than others.

By far the most dramatic losses were in the ""Big Four"" public housing complexes, which were shut down by the City Council and razed to make way for a smaller number of mixed-income housing in the years after the storm. Less visibly, thousands of modest mom-and-pop rentals around the city flooded and were never brought back online or were converted into single-family homes.

The result is a checkerboard. The Lower 9th Ward, obliterated during Katrina when the floodwall on the Industrial Canal failed, is now home to a mere 5,000 people, just more than a third as many as lived there two decades ago. Meanwhile, the Central Business District and Lower Garden District have a seen a boom in residents, more than doubling their population as former office towers were converted into condos and apartments. And areas near Tulane and Loyola universities as well as the University of New Orleans on the lakefront also now have more people than they did before the storm.

As of 2020, a bare majority of the city's residents, 53%, identified as Black. That's compared to the two-thirds of the population before Katrina.

Some portion of the change owes to changes to census questionnaires that encouraged people to provide more nuanced answers about their identity. The census now counts nearly 12,200 of New Orleans' residents as multi-racial - almost three times as many as a decade ago - and there are an additional 2,000 people who do not identify with any of the government's major racial classifications.

As with its suburbs, particularly Jefferson Parish, the last decade has also seen the Hispanic population boom in New Orleans. A community that had numbered less than 15,000 before Katrina now numbers 31,000 and makes up about 8% of the city's population.

An infusion of newcomers

Exactly how much of the city's growth since 2010 came from residents returning and how much from newcomers is unknown, though there is ample anecdotal evidence that there are many in the latter group.

Many of those new residents were drawn by housing costs that were cheap by the standards of other major metropolitan areas and a desire for culture and authenticity. Among millennials and Gen Z, New Orleans was widely seen as ""an intriguing environment and a place in a story they wanted to be a part of,"" Tulane University geographer Richard Campanella said, comparing it to the ""cultural renaissance"" of the 1920s in the French Quarter.

The influx of new residents is a daily reality in Holy Cross, said Calvin Alexander, who heads the neighborhood's homeowners association. Still at only 63% of its pre-Katrina population, the neighborhood -- which abuts the Lower 9th Ward -- has seen a steady stream of people buying homes from Chicago, Seattle, Portland, New York and elsewhere.

Alexander bought in Holy Cross in 1978, finding it provided many of the benefits of more suburban areas people were relocating to on the north shore without the headaches of a commute.

He said the new homeowners have been a good addition to the neighborhood and by and large have integrated themselves well into a community where some residents live in homes their families have owned for generations.

But, he said, housing prices have gone haywire. It used to be that $100,000 would buy a ""fairly substantial home,"" but now ""it's nothing"" to see small houses go for between $175,000 and $300,000.

""For those who want to sell and want to realize their lifelong investment, it's a good thing,"" Alexander said. ""On the other hand, my daughter lives in a property that my wife and I own as a rental, and she wants to live in Holy Cross, and frankly she can't find a thing to buy.""

For Plyer, the key question is not necessarily how many people are coming from elsewhere. Indeed, the very vibrancy of the city may owe to the constantly changing demographics and the interplay of cultures and ideas.

The more important questions, she said, may be: ""Are the culture-bearers able to afford to live in a city? Are we paying our culture-makers a living wage?

""Those are the things that matter a lot more to our culture than whether new people are coming or not.""

Even before the 2020 census, there were indications that New Orleans' post-Katrina population had already peaked. Census Bureau estimates showed a 2016 high of about 392,300 residents. After that, a decline due to outmigration resumed, a trend that has been the rule in New Orleans demographics since the population hit 628,000 in 1960.

The recent outmigration now appears to be driven by low-income workers who can no longer afford to live in the city.

Cashauna Hill, executive director of the Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center, returned to the city herself in 2011. She noted that as more people were priced out of the city, the suburbs absorbed some working-class people - which has helped fuel the diversification of Jefferson Parish and St. Bernard. But the lack of a functional regional public transit system has made it difficult for many of them to get to jobs in the city.

""You have to keep in mind that low-income workers who have been displaced to the suburbs, a large percentage of those people are there without their own personal vehicle,"" she said. ""It's not that far away in a car, but if you don't have a car, it's a world away from New Orleans.""

This forces lower-income residents to either take jobs in the suburbs, or move to other metro areas with better transit options, like Atlanta or Houston.

Built for White residents fleeing the city, inner suburbs like St. Bernard are increasingly diverse

Keyara Staples had driven across the St. Claude Avenue Bridge into St. Bernard Parish precisely once since moving to New Orleans in 2018.

HousingNOLA, which advocates for increasing affordable housing, notes that 58,200 low- to moderate-income people commute into the city every day and argues they could be enticed to live there given the opportunity. To do so would require making use of some of the nearly 20,700 vacant properties in the city, according to a forthcoming report from the group.

'The rent is so high'

For Perkins, the explosion in housing costs over the past decade was shocking.

After living in the city for much of her life, Perkins moved to Georgia a couple years before the storm. When she sought to come back in 2013, she was dumbfounded to find that apartments she had expected to rent for a few hundred dollars were going for nearly $1,000.

For a few years she lived with a roommate in Slidell. She was only able to return to the city after her mother asked a tenant who was renting one side of the family double to leave.

But while she made it back, it has been a different story for her two daughters.

One daughter moved to Texas after getting her doctorate at Tulane, saying she couldn't find a job that would pay enough in Louisiana. Her other daughter commutes from Baton Rouge for phlebotomy training because she can't afford the city.

""The average person in my community works at a fast-food restaurant or some other minimum wage job. So we definitely could not afford to purchase the homes in the neighborhoods now, because they're buying and renovating and selling at a rate we can't afford,"" she said. ""If you don't already own a home, you probably will never own a home, and investors will make sure you never own a home. And they will make sure you don't rent in certain neighborhoods because the rent is so high.""

Michael Hecht, who heads the regional economic development organization GNO Inc., pointed to at least two hopeful signs for the city's future. The recent sales of New Orleans start-ups, including a $1 billion deal for survey and analysis company Lucid, has ""put a fire in the belly"" of the business community, he said. And the possibility that the pandemic-driven trend toward remote work will encourage more people who like New Orleans but work elsewhere to move here.

'Not as sleepy': After decades of population explosion, growing pains evident in St. Tammany

When Robin Parker would visit family in Covington, Mandeville and Slidell as a girl in the 1960s and 1970s, much of St. Tammany Parish was the...

But taking advantage of either will require efforts, both in terms of policy and perception, he said.

""We need to have three areas of focus: first, on acute issues like infrastructure and public safety; second, on the strategic issue of economic diversification; and finally, on driving a narrative that makes greater New Orleans a place people want to grow both their business, and their family - there has to be an attractive brand, with a reality to back it up,"" Hecht said.

Some of those who have managed to make it back, even belatedly, also see signs of hope.

For much of her childhood, 23-year-old Tashia Gaspard's family bounced between New Orleans and Georgia. But she always felt connected to a city where her family has roots going back to the 1700s.

Returning wasn't easy. When she moved down in 2019, Gaspard spent time in the city's low-barrier homeless shelter before she got settled and started her own business.

While the city has changed, Gaspard said that she sees a bright future for New Orleans.

""We know New Orleans is always going to change,"" Gaspard said. ""The river deposits, but it will always over the years change course. It's up to us to make sure it doesn't go too far away.""

A rural Delta town withers amid population loss. It represents a broader trend in Louisiana. Shopping

LAS VEGAS, Jan. 3, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Indigo Technologies, an automotive OEM delivering an entirely new class of smooth, roomy and affordable electric vehicles (EVs), is introducing two new vehicle designs aimed at the rideshare and delivery market - Indigo FLOW™ and FLOW PLUS™- at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Indigo's breakthrough robotic wheels enable new types of EVs that ride significantly smoother, are more spacious and operate at lower cost than any other vehicles in their class. The FLOW and FLOW PLUS will be markedly better in all of these attributes compared to the Toyota Rav4 and the Ford Transit Connect, respectively. Both FLOW and FLOW PLUS will provide more than 250 miles of range with only a 40kWh battery.

Indigo Introduces New Class of Smooth, Roomy, Affordable EVs for Rideshare and Delivery at CES 2022

With explosive growth for on-demand deliveries and rideshare, and with companies like Uber and Amazon joining the Climate Pledge, providing efficient and capable EVs that drivers can afford is an imperative. Today's heavy EVs are too inefficient and expensive for gig drivers, but reducing mass to save costs has meant sacrificing space and comfort due to conventional propulsion and suspension technologies.

""Indigo invented robotic wheels that uniquely enable more space and comfort for small urban EVs,"" says Will Graylin, CEO of Indigo. ""Without the transmission and motor between the wheels, Indigo FLOW has a low, flat floor that provides more cargo space than any vehicle of its size. And the active suspension in each wheel makes for an amazing ride comfort at an affordable price that people will love.""

Automotive Innovators Join Indigo's Team

Indigo announces Volker Kaese, former Audi Head of Innovation Product Management, has joined Indigo as Chief Technology Officer. Kaese, who led development of the Volkswagen XL1 (310 MPG) and Audi e-tron show cars, brings over 20 years of vehicle innovation to spearhead Indigo's vehicle programs.

""I am excited to deliver the highest impact on both driver experience and the environment,"" said Kaese. ""From the voluminous interior to the sliding doors Indigo FLOW will allow drivers to be more efficient at their jobs. Ultimately they will be able to earn more while also doing good for our planet.""

Also joining Indigo are Eric Obers, formerly design leader at Porsche and Lucid, and Hugh Robinson, formerly of Porsche and General Motors, to lead design for the FLOW product line.

The strong fourth quarter of 308,600 vehicles gave Tesla full-year sales of 936,000, up 87% from the 2020 total, and above the 900,000 mark that had been the target set by many analysts.

""Taking a step back, with the chip shortage a major overhang on the auto space and logistical issues globally these delivery numbers were jaw dropping,"" Dan Ives, analyst for Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients Sunday. He said Wall Street forecasts of 265,000 Tesla sales in the fourth quarter would have taken full-year sales to 892,000. The 900,000 sales target that Tesla easily cleared was a ""best case number in the eyes of the street,"" according to Ives.

Other automakers are all expected to report reduced fourth-quarter sales when they release US numbers this coming week. Tesla reports only global sales, but industrywide, global auto sales are expected to be broadly lower in the fourth quarter.

Cox Automotive is forecasting that overall US fourth quarter sales will be down 24% due to the shortage of computer chips that caused plants to temporarily shut, limited the inventory of vehicles in dealerships and drove up car prices to record levels.

""The industry ran out of vehicles, and sales stalled in the second half,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, chief economist for Cox Automotive. ""Total sales in the second-half of 2021 were the slowest in a decade. Demand is healthy, but supply and production disruptions kept the industry in check. You can't sell what you don't have.""

Tesla had its own chip shortage issues during the year but was able to manage through them. The EV maker's achievement was more impressive considering that it is facing increased competition from traditional automakers now offering more electric vehicle models.

For example, the Ford Mustang Mach-E had US sales of nearly 25,000 vehicles through November in its first year on the market. Ford recently announced plans to triple production to meet demand. There are also new EV-only automakers now selling vehicles, including Lucid and Rivian, which both recently won MotorTrend's car and truck of the year honors.

So while Telsa's share of the EV market might be declining somewhat in the face of new competition, the demand for EVs is growing even faster, allowing Tesla to continue to report strong growth.

""While there are many competitors in the EV space, Tesla continues to dominate market share as evidenced again this quarter while battling through the chip shortage,"" Ives said.

Tesla has forecast that with new factories near Austin, Texas, and Berlin about to start full-scale production in 2022, it should have annual global sales growth of 50% or better for at least the next few years.

Investors have rewarded Tesla, lifting its share price 52% in 2021. While that's modest compared to the 743% gain shares achieved in 2020, it was still better than most automakers, including most other EV-only companies. And it was enough to give Tesla a market value greater than the combined value of the 12 largest global automakers, and to make it only the sixth company ever to be worth more than $1 trillion.","{'uri': 'wraltechwire.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'WRAL TechWire'}",[],https://www.wraltechwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tesla-charger.jpg,0.003921568627450966,,True,0,0.003921568627450966,378900180,1

It is much more than that, which is why you need to be careful while designing it. These are some of the most wonderful tools that help you build your brand image. So, if you want to create the best first impression on your audience, you need to learn how to create a perfect business card.

There are few privileged insights to extraordinary business card designs; however, most are barely noticeable. Except if you are a creator yourself, try not to plan your cards. However, you can surely give your designer some rough idea about it. What looks great won't look incredible to every other person. So when an expert planner suggests changes, kindly pay attention to them.

In this article, we will be sharing some tips that can help you build the most effective business cards for your company. Let us have a look at these tips below.

The primary rule of making a powerful business card is to focus on your target audience and industry. Select plan components and tones related to your specialty. Make your card effectively appealing to your business, making a decent portrayal of your company and a method for advertising your item. For instance, assuming you are a craftsman, you might incorporate a photograph connected with carpentry to feature your subject matter.

There is generally a great deal of business card trading on brand occasions. That implies individuals wind up returning home with heaps of cards that regularly sit getting dusty around their work area until they can be tried to toss them away. To this end, it's critical to have a business card that stands out in a heap of others, and the ideal way to do that is to get inventive or creative.

Rather than simply putting your subtleties and colors onto a customary square card, it would help if you zested things up by evaluating the most recent visiting card patterns. You can give the edges a vivid paint wash, so they stand apart when they're in a stack, or you may decide to cut it into an unusual and awesome shape. You can also check out Printyourorder.com to create customized designer visiting cards for your company.

Most business cards are imprinted on cardboard material. This is the most financially savvy choice for printing your visiting cards. Assuming you're willing to get somewhat more innovative, you can print onto a wide range of various materials, including plastics, metals, wood and slates.

Remember that they should be compact and simple to store in a pocket or folder case, yet get imaginative with your decision of stock material, and you'll immediately stand apart from ordinary visiting cards.

While designing a visiting card for your company, getting carried away with thoughts is not difficult. You truly need it to stick out, in addition to you having a ton of data to incorporate. This mentality can rapidly transform into a business card that is excessively occupied, excessively confounded and most certainly not interesting to the normal individual.

In this moment of delight, individuals need to know data as fast as conceivable. In this way, make certain to keep your calling cards design straightforward. Utilize one to three tones max, clean fuse lines and straight edges and don't become excessively insane with the information included.

Before you continue with printing your visiting cards, guarantee that you check for blunders. Check if there are any grammatical errors in the subtleties you have given on the card. Additionally, abstain from committing normal errors, for example, making a straight line on every one of the sides of calling cards. This is an extremely normal mix-up and may bring about some misalignment when your card gets printed.

Utilizing colors is quite possibly the most famous way organizations work, and designers separate their plans from the opposition. It's a verifiably amazing asset - and a device ought to be utilized shrewdly. If your brand as of now has a marked set of tones, take a stab at working with these to keep your image steady. If not, allude to the shading wheel to build up a shading plan that is correlative and masterfully engaging.

Except if you have printing capabilities, DIY business cards frequently appear modest or inferior, and that is not the impression you need to give your audience. You might have the option to save a reasonable measure of cash and update your data all the more effectively, assuming you print them yourself. Yet, the effect that you get by professionally printing them is extraordinary. So, always consider taking professional help when designing your visiting cards.

Remember that business cards have a restricted space where you can put text. Put some ideas in what textual styles you need to utilize. If you have textual styles in your brand, then, at that point, it's savvy to use them to keep the plan reliable. Try not to use enlivening and script text styles as your principal textual style. These are more qualified for titles and names.

When picking tones for your textual styles and illustrations, recall contrast is critical. You need your contact information to be effectively lucid, so use san-serif fonts for educational messages, for example, telephone numbers and subheaders.

Since it's an ID of your company, you need to invest in material that effectively talks about your business. If you don't bargain in such an industry where there is something about the materials, go for a decent quality one. Utilizing a great quality printer on a quality card will assist you with sticking out. A bad quality card is an adequate justification for clients to dismiss you.

Designing a business card that stands out can be a tough task. However, nothing is impossible when you have the right knowledge with you. Check out the tips mentioned above and implement them to create wonderful and effective visiting cards.","{'uri': 'opptrends.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Opptrends 2020'}","[{'uri': 'richard_orland@opptrends.com', 'name': 'Richard Orland', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.opptrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Important-Things-to-Remember-when-Designing-a-Business-Card.jpg,0.411764705882353,,False,0,0.411764705882353,378899580,1

The Mercedes-Benz EQS large luxury sedan has a drag coefficient of 0.200, making it the most aerodynamically efficient production Mercedes car yet.

The new Lucid Air sedan, which won Motor Trend's Car of the Year award in November, has a 0.200 Cd.

Tesla claims the new Model S Plaid, which can reach 60 mph in under two seconds, is the most aerodynamically efficient production car on the market, with a 0.208 drag coefficient.

The figures for these cars are not an apples-to-apples comparison, though, because different wind tunnels yield different results, test procedures vary, and the figure used to derive the drag coefficient rating is based in part on the car's frontal area, which can differ from vehicle to vehicle.

Still, the lower the drag coefficient, the less power it takes for the drivetrain to move the vehicle and the farther it can go on a charge.

Mercedes-Benz engineers calculated that reducing the Cd on an EV from 0.23 to 0.22, would yield a 2 percent increase in driving range at 56 mph, which adds about 9.3 miles of range to a charge.

Tesla says that a 10 percent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency yields a 5 to 8 percent increase in the range of one of its vehicles.

For Lucid's Air sedan, low aerodynamic drag played a key role in meeting one of CEO Peter Rawlinson's major goals: a 500-mile range between charges for one version of the car.

To help achieve that, the California startup hired Jean-Charles Monnet away from the Red Bull Formula One racing team to head Lucid's aero development.","{'uri': 'todayheadline.co', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TodayHeadline'}",[],https://todayheadline.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TH.png,0.223529411764706,,False,0,0.223529411764706,378897420,4

In all these, two of such events caught the attention of yours sincerely, hence, it has triggered this narrative. First, was the change of guards in the topmost echelon of the chairmanship position of First Bank Plc. Mr. Remi Babalola, former Minister of State for Finance, stood down as the board chairman, for Mr. Ahmad Abdullahi, former Director, Banking Supervision Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The news reverberated hugely on the financial system sphere of the land and even beyond. This was attributed to the robustness of the statures of the dramatize personae concerned on one hand. On the other, it can be ascribed to the elephantine or better still, the massive posture of the institution involved. On a salutary note, it is on record that the new chair taintlessly journeyed through his career in the apex bank. While there, he was an epitome of calmness, who abhorred bombastic rhetorics. To a large extent, he could be associated with meekness and lucid ideas. No wonder he gracefully and gleefully bowed out of the apex bank unscathed, some years ago.

It is on record also that during his central banking sojourn, he tenured one of the brightest and best moments in the annals of our financial system landscape that was devoid of any turmoil or rancor. These un-toxic traits among other reasons are capable of equipping him adequately in surmounting the challenges (if any) in his new position. Second, the other event that suffused through and filled the entire spectrum of the banking landscape in the land, was the acquisition of UBN by Titan Trust bank (2TB coinage is mine). When the news first broke out, many observers thought the acquisition or merger was consummated by Access bank Plc that recently absorbed Diamond. But when it became known that 2TB was the new owner, it sent jitters down the spine of many a depositor including but not limited to our Arise TV News Sunday Live Show anchor man Dr. Ruben Abati and his crew. According to them, it threw up some sort of surprises in the hearts of some depositors. A commentator had even described the development thus: ""....with 2TB's 89 percent stake acquisition in UBN, this was an uncommon acquisition or takeover."" Alas! He went further to say that: ""A Rabbit had finally swallowed an Elephant."" This is because a two year old bank had ironically acquired a-ten decade old bank. Indeed, it was a big news.

However, to the uninitiated, who are not abreast with developments in the disruptive business strategic parlance, this would pass for a new an unusual development. Contrariwise, disruptive business strategists, would hail the 2TB's strategic initiative. This is imperative given the positivism that Google, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, Nubank (disruptor of banks in Brazil), Flutterwave, Tesla etc had infused into the growth and development of businesses globally. For the acquisition to be effective and productive, the new UBN must begin to mimic some of the business models or stepping into the culture of Nubank especially in the areas of unlocking opportunities targeted at reducing cost of credits as well as adopting and adapting their problem solving approach into the Nigerian market. That being the case, are we expecting the new UBN to transform its culture to: .."" that of being ...""young,fast, hungry, and operate in a high trust environment?"" If that holds sway, are we also expecting the new UBN ""....organization structure is completely different than that of traditional companies work in a squared structure. A product of this system is a flat moldable structure, in which we are more efficient and faster in fixing and building whatever needs turning?""

In the positive development that ensued, the veil was eventually lifted by the stakeholders. The man behind the mask that would give strategic direction and provide efficacious leadership to the new bank was unveiled. Like that great columnist and prolific writer - 'Mr. Candido Johnson' (the man behind the mask), Mr. Tunde Lemo, the quintessentially cerebral banker, who is clearly but enormously gifted in thoroughness and paying attention to details, was mentioned as the Chairman of the board of Directors of the transformed 2TB (now UBN). This, perhaps had put paid to the initial banking inertia and extinguished the confusion, and consequently, the banking face was literally ""lit up with a new and radiant light."" Indeed, it was a big sigh of relief for both existing and prospective depositors to say the least. This air of relief cannot be controverted against the backdrop of his pedigree in the transformation agenda of the CBN where he earlier proved his mettle as a member of the team that reshaped and repositioned the Bank. I recall clearly while the working relationship lasted, he often stated to yours sincerely that : "" We needed to drop the toga of too much bureaucracy without compromising standards and work as if this edifice was a private entity."" He was such an amazing boss who never compromised standards while meeting deadlines. He was exceedingly resourceful and never allowed any memorandum to stay on his table for more than 24 hours. Despite his tight schedule, he masterfully replied all text messages even till date. This is the kind of person that will steer the ship of state in the new improved UBN.

In spite of the above, and without mincing words, one must state categorically that the tasks ahead are daunting, but they are not insurmountable. The good news? The management team led by Mr. Tunde Lemo, appears to be ""big, strong and reliable."" Additionally, they seem to be ethically and professionally sound, technologically innovative and technically savvy. More importantly, their clientele base is deep, visibly elastic and susceptible to accommodating more converts. Furthermore, the management team is blessed with array of experiences they can draw inferences from. The most profound, handy and perhaps the lowest hanging fruit, being a similar occurrence in the past. Retrospectively speaking, therefore, this type of take over or acquisition is NOT a novelty. We can recall quite vividly that Standard Trust Bank did same to United Bank for Africa (UBA) on August 1, 2005.

It was christened as one of the ""biggest"" and most celebrated mergers on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). The outcome? Your guess is as good as mine. UBA moved from a near analogue bank into a digitalized one, thereby leading to more efficient and effective service delivery and by extension posting juicy returns on shareholders' funds. For instance, the profit after tax in 2005 stood at N5,921m. However, after the first three years of the merger, UBA's ""gross earnings for 2008 increased by 55% to N169.6 billion (2007: N109.5 billion) with strong contributions from all of our business lines. Profit before tax and exceptional items for 2008 increased by 82% to N56.8 billion (2007: N31.2 billion) and profit after tax increased by 90% to N40.8 billion (2007: N21.5 billion)."" Thus, up until now, UBA's trajectory of growth has remained on the upbeat. Without being immodest, my prognosis is that 2TB (UBN) shall equal or surpass this phenomenal growth in not-too-far a future.

In view of the foregoing developments in our financial system, the above salient happenstances cannot be wished away. Typically, markets that are information-centric cannot but respond positively or otherwise to these two key occurrences in the days ahead. In some climes, such positive developments could jerk up the values of their stocks to witness unprecedented upswing and by extension, a non-deceleration, or some sort of soaring to the high heaven the returns on shareholders' funds.

Head or tail, there shall be market reactions. With these two key dynamic appointments, the space is expected to witness more opportunities that will be driven by more 'co-optition' ie ""competition, collaboration and co-operation"". This has been amplified by Omordion while commenting recently on the outlook for 2022. He elegantly put it that "".....there would be more opportunities for financial services, especially banks, expected to take advantage of the free trade zone agreement."" Within this context and advancing forward, it is no longer going to be business as usual. The duo of Lemo and Ahmad, who are no doubt tested and proven hands having bestrode the financial system stability sphere like colossus, will always strive hard to be primus inter pares. It is therefore, incumbent on them to prove this point by leveraging on technology, their vast experiences, and focus more on revolutionizing the traditional banking processes, practices and procedures that would stem the tide of their reaching the above mentioned strategic goal. It is when this strategic objective is achieved that the above poser would not have only been answered, but must have been seen to have been answered in the affirmative.","{'uri': 'tribuneonlineng.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Tribune Online'}",[],https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Opinion-logo.jpg,0.1215686274509804,,False,0,0.1215686274509804,378887700,1

The magazine chose the Lucid Air as the year's best car in November and the Rivian R1T as top truck last month. Its third award, SUV of the Year, went to a gasoline-powered vehicle from an established automaker, the Genesis GV70.

Rivian beat out another electric pickup, the GMC Hummer EV, for the coveted truck award, which Ram won in each of the past three years. It's the first time since 2008 that one of the Detroit 3 didn't win.

""The Rivian R1T would win praise if it were merely a credible pickup truck that is also an electric vehicle, but it's far more,"" the magazine wrote. ""Not content to simply mount an electric motor or two under the hood or box of a traditional pickup, Rivian used the opportunity to reexamine what a modern pickup truck could be.""

The R1T is the first EV to be Truck of the Year. Car of the Year went to the Tesla Model S in 2013 and the Chevrolet Bolt EV in 2017.

The R1T and Air also are among the nine finalists for the North American Car, Truck and Utility Vehicle of the Year awards, which will be announced next week.","{'uri': 'autonews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Automotive News'}",[],https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/RIVIANR-MAIN_i.jpg,0.3490196078431373,eng-7380498,False,0.843137264251709,0.3490196078431373,378883260,1

Not since the low-slung, streamlined General Motors EV1 from the late 1990s and the 2013 Volkswagen XL1 have production cars and light trucks slipped through the air with such efficiency.

For EVs, a low aerodynamic drag coefficient, or Cd, is crucial for lowering wind and road noise that would normally be masked by the piston engine. More importantly, a sleek, wind-cheating body enables a vehicle to go farther on a charge -- no trivial matter for consumers considering their first EV.

The lower the aerodynamic drag, the less power required to propel the vehicle at speed.

""The pressure is on to save energy any way possible. It's critically important for range,"" said Paul Snyder, chair of Transportation Design at Detroit's College for Creative Studies, one of the nation's premier schools for automotive designers.

Three sedans are contending for most aerodynamically efficient EV.

The Mercedes-Benz EQS large luxury sedan has a drag coefficient of 0.200, making it the most aerodynamically efficient production Mercedes car yet.

The new Lucid Air sedan, which won Motor Trend's Car of the Year award in November, has a 0.200 Cd.

Tesla claims the new Model S Plaid, which can reach 60 mph in under two seconds, is the most aerodynamically efficient production car on the market, with a 0.208 drag coefficient.

The figures for these cars are not an apples-to-apples comparison, though, because different wind tunnels yield different results, test procedures vary, and the figure used to derive the drag coefficient rating is based in part on the car's frontal area, which can differ from vehicle to vehicle.

Still, the lower the drag coefficient, the less power it takes for the drivetrain to move the vehicle and the farther it can go on a charge.

Mercedes-Benz engineers calculated that reducing the Cd on an EV from 0.23 to 0.22, would yield a 2 percent increase in driving range at 56 mph, which adds about 9.3 miles of range to a charge.

Tesla says that a 10 percent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency yields a 5 to 8 percent increase in the range of one of its vehicles.

For Lucid's Air sedan, low aerodynamic drag played a key role in meeting one of CEO Peter Rawlinson's major goals: a 500-mile range between charges for one version of the car.

To help achieve that, the California startup hired Jean-Charles Monnet away from the Red Bull Formula One racing team to head Lucid's aero development.

He didn't try to incorporate aero tricks from F1 racing on the Air sedan. But his 11 years at Red Bull did influence how the car manages airflow under, over, through and around the vehicle. Monnet said he was extremely proud of the diffuser.

The diffuser attaches to a vehicle's underbelly and usually consists of vertical slats mounted to a flat panel that covers mechanical components, such as the axles and suspension parts.

According to a Car and Driver report on race car aerodynamics, the ""diffuser acts as an expansion chamber to manage the air as it exits from underneath the car and reintegrates it with higher-pressure ambient air. Smoothing this transition reduces turbulence and drag in the car's wake and improves airflow under the car.""

In a 2017 test of the Air's aerodynamics performance on the racetrack, the car reached 235 mph and the tires remained firmly planted on the track.

""The design of the diffuser started early on,"" Monnet said. ""We only used computational fluid dynamic simulations. We went straight on the track at 235 mph. When you have that speed, aerodynamics is critical, and the diffuser performed as well as we expected.""

Snyder, of the College for Creative Studies, believes the EV era will see aerodynamic drag coefficients for cars in the low 0.20s become normal, not exceptions, as the design language of cars changes to adapt to electric drivetrains. It'll drop for pickups and SUVs, too, he says, but that challenge is far more difficult because of their body styles.

As Ford was sculpting a smooth body for the Mustang Mach-E, the aerodynamic team was busy focusing on the details, from the wheels, to the active grille shutters to the underbody, says Debbie Hands, aerodynamics supervisor for the vehicle. Ford's hot-selling electric crossover has a drag coefficient of just 0.28.

""As we were working through the development process, we had the styling studio in the wind tunnel with us to try and tune every last little bit we could,"" Hands said. ""In our work, we were really touching every part of the exterior.""

EVs have aerodynamic advantages over internal combustion engine vehicles. Perhaps the biggest: the grille.

On vehicles such as the Mustang Mach-E, Air or Porsche Taycan, the grille is either closed or reduced in size to little more than a slit under the fascia since no radiator is needed to disperse engine heat. Air going through a grille to cool an engine is one of the biggest drags on a traditional car or light truck.

""The grille actually traps a lot of air. There are more efficient ways of cooling the battery through the undercarriage, so that's a big part of it,"" Snyder told Automotive News.

Look for exterior body parts, he says, to become hidden, very smooth or mounted flush with the body.

Automakers ""are spending money in areas that really make a big difference,"" Snyder said. ""Door handles and mirrors and electronic navigation systems are being covered and disguised and designed for slippery airflow.""

At Lucid, Monnet may have one of the slipperiest cars on the road, but the quest to lower aerodynamic drag continues.

""With every vehicle, you try to understand how the airflow behaves around the vehicle. And what is important is the cooperation between the engineers and designers,"" he said. ""We are all marching towards the same goal.""","{'uri': 'autonews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Automotive News'}","[{'uri': 'richard_truett@autonews.com', 'name': 'Richard Truett', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/EQS-MAIN_i_4.jpg,0.1529411764705881,,False,0,0.1529411764705881,378883200,6

A quarter-century of peace has effaced many of the bitter sectarian divides of the three decades-long Troubles.

But to understand how important identity remains, just watch Northern Ireland's football team before an international. Some players belt out God Save the Queen with gusto. Others listen in silence to an anthem they do not consider represents them.

Football was partitioned along with the island of Ireland in 1921. But a long-simmering debate over whether a new anthem is needed is just one way the UK region is struggling to deal with the emblems of its twin identities.

In December, four years after its initial deadline, an official commission published a report on emblems and other cultural expressions of identity.

""In the conflictual politics in our society,"" it noted, wryly, ""we seem to spend an inordinate amount of time discussing flags, symbols, bonfires, statues, murals, banners and memorials"".

Take flags. The commission considered whether public buildings should either fly only the union jack, since Northern Ireland is part of the UK, or the Irish flag as well to honour both Irishness and Britishness together -- a compromise would be to fly the union jack only on certain days or have a no-flags-at-all policy.

As for other, similar issues -- the reason the £800,000, 168-page report is likely to gather dust on a shelf -- the commission concluded that ""there is currently no meeting point"".

Ironically, Ireland's tricolour is supposed to represent both communities -- the green of the Catholics, orange for Protestants, and white symbolising peace.

But even colour-coding can be complicated. The Northern Ireland football team plays at the Windsor Park stadium, in a traditionally unionist area, wearing a strip in the colour -- green -- traditionally associated with the Irish Republic. At the start of my Ireland posting last summer, I must subconsciously have been hedging my bets when, without calculating, I took along an orange jacket and a green dress to a conference.

Sinn Féin, the republican party, which is now the most popular in Ireland both north and south, wants a vote on reunification in five to 10 years. Polls in Northern Ireland suggest the popular mood is less sure -- its population can already decide to identify as British, or Irish, or both. But Brexit may be shaping opinions.

In order to avoid having a hard border on the island, the post-Brexit trade rules known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, drew a customs line down the Irish Sea, leaving Northern Ireland within the EU's customs union.

A Lucid Talk poll in Northern Ireland in November found 36 per cent of respondents would ditch the protocol, reunite with the Republic of Ireland and return to full EU membership, versus 30 per cent who wanted to stay British even if that meant a land border with the Republic.

On the other hand, a survey in December by conservative peer and pollster Lord Ashcroft found 54 per cent favoured staying part of the UK against 46 per cent who opposed, once undecided votes were removed. But it also found that 67 per cent thought Brexit had made Irish reunification more likely.

In the Republic, nearly three-quarters of people embrace the idea of a reunited Ireland -- as long as it doesn't happen now and they don't have to pay more taxes or change their flag and anthem, according to an Ipsos MRBI poll for the Irish Times. Even among Sinn Féin voters, only just over a third of respondents saw Irish unification as a priority.

Addressing an Irish government forum on its ""shared island"" programme, Northern Irish comedian Patrick Kielty summed it up: ""The vast majority of people in the north no longer look at things through a binary prism. They're getting on with their lives -- and each other,"" he said. ""Is it a love-in? No. Is it united? Definitely not. But you know too often on this island we get fixated with the notion of being united -- remaining part of the UK, becoming part of a united Ireland . . . This island is never going to be united, and that's OK.""","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times News'}",[],https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcc9219de-a1ee-4de0-8d14-0848724a1048.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,-0.01960784313725494,,False,0,-0.01960784313725494,378882060,1

Mercedes is set to unveil its most efficient vehicle to date at the opening of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. While its presence will now be virtual at the show (like ours), due to the pandemic, the reveal is still expected to impress.

The Mercedes Vision EQXX is just a prototype but as the name suggests, it's a demonstration of the direction that the company's all-electric range - that all bear an EQ badge - will take.

There are already three EV's in the EQ lineup: the EQS, an S-class equivalent in luxury; the EQB, set to be an electric equivalent of the GLB; and the EQE, an E-class level sedan.

The rather moody-looking preview picture for the EQXX suggests a coupe, perhaps something more like the current CLA or CLS. Though sensibly, this could be based on the C-class coupe. After all, a C-class EV would be the most mainstream offering to date and direct competition for the likes of the Tesla Model 3, Polestar 2 and BMW i4.

It's rumored that the Vision EQXX could give potential range figures of up to 600 miles. If true, this would make it class-leading, beating the likes of the Lucid Air (520 miles) and Tesla Model S Long Range (405 miles). If this kind of range would then be placed into a C-class equivalent vehicle, Mercedes could find itself dominating the EV market.

It's no surprise that younger, more agile car companies, like Tesla and Lucid, have led the electric revolution but the experience of companies like Ford, General Motors, VW and Mercedes is now rearing its head. These automotive giants have now fully committed to electric power and we can expect a big push of models with the benefit of production volume.

The strong fourth quarter of 308,600 vehicles gave Tesla full-year sales of 936,000, up 87% from the 2020 total, and above the 900,000 mark that had been the target set by many analysts.

""Taking a step back, with the chip shortage a major overhang on the auto space and logistical issues globally these delivery numbers were jaw dropping,"" Dan Ives, analyst for Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients Sunday. He said Wall Street forecasts of 265,000 Tesla sales in the fourth quarter would have taken full-year sales to 892,000. The 900,000 sales target that Tesla easily cleared was a ""best case number in the eyes of the street,"" according to Ives.

Other automakers are all expected to report reduced fourth-quarter sales when they release US numbers this coming week. Tesla reports only global sales, but industrywide, global auto sales are expected to be broadly lower in the fourth quarter.

Cox Automotive is forecasting that overall US fourth quarter sales will be down 24% due to the shortage of computer chips that caused plants to temporarily shut, limited the inventory of vehicles in dealerships and drove up car prices to record levels.

""The industry ran out of vehicles, and sales stalled in the second half,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, chief economist for Cox Automotive. ""Total sales in the second-half of 2021 were the slowest in a decade. Demand is healthy, but supply and production disruptions kept the industry in check. You can't sell what you don't have.""

Tesla had its own chip shortage issues during the year but was able to manage through them. The EV maker's achievement was more impressive considering that it is facing increased competition from traditional automakers now offering more electric vehicle models.

For example, the Ford Mustang Mach-E had US sales of nearly 25,000 vehicles through November in its first year on the market. Ford recently announced plans to triple production to meet demand. There are also new EV-only automakers now selling vehicles, including Lucid and Rivian, which both recently won MotorTrend's car and truck of the year honors.

So while Telsa's share of the EV market might be declining somewhat in the face of new competition, the demand for EVs is growing even faster, allowing Tesla to continue to report strong growth.

""While there are many competitors in the EV space, Tesla continues to dominate market share as evidenced again this quarter while battling through the chip shortage,"" Ives said.

Tesla has forecast that with new factories near Austin, Texas, and Berlin about to start full-scale production in 2022, it should have annual global sales growth of 50% or better for at least the next few years.

Investors have rewarded Tesla, lifting its share price 52% in 2021. While that's modest compared to the 743% gain shares achieved in 2020, it was still better than most automakers, including most other EV-only companies. And it was enough to give Tesla a market value greater than the combined value of the 12 largest global automakers, and to make it only the sixth company ever to be worth more than $1 trillion.","{'uri': 'cnnphilippines.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'cnnphilippines.com'}",[],http://cnnphilippines.com/.imaging/mte/demo-cnn-new/750x450/dam/cnn/2022/1/3/Tesla-0103_CNNPH.jpg/jcr:content/Tesla-0103_CNNPH.jpg,0.003921568627450966,,True,0,0.003921568627450966,378866580,1

On Thursday, the first strip was released in Marathi and English apart from the local tribal language Gondi.

The 'Gadchiroli Files', maybe the first comic strip launched by the police, is will be used as a medium to propagate various ideas revolving around the ground realities of the tribal-dominated district. Though destructive and counter-productive Maoist violence was the inaugural theme, the comic strip would also have other issues of government policies, developments and challenges in the coming days.

In the first strip, a Maoist is shown approaching a school student, trying to lure him to join the rebel movement, which is a reality in the district in several remote parts.

After the student rejects the offer, the comic strip shows the miffed rebels setting the zilla parishad school on fire, and hurling a grenade. The Maoist is shown laughing out loud while hailing the movement with a 'Lal Salam', which is their signature way of greeting each other.

A senior police official say the Maoists are known to have clandestine units, like 'Bal Sangam', comprising minors, whom they see as effective couriers or messengers apart from future recruits.

SP Ankit Goyal said the comic strip would project the ground realities of the district, in which Maoist violence is only an integral part. ""The medium of cartoon was chosen for its universal acceptance and lucid character easily appealing to all. The subjects would encompass issues pertaining to the district, which need to be exposed to the rest of the world,"" said Goyal, adding a comic strip would be released every fortnight.

Goyal said the police department had been adopting various platforms for positive propaganda for public awareness through posters, banners, pamphlets and handbills for information dissemination, which would be beneficial for the local population.","{'uri': 'timesofindia.indiatimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Times of India'}",[],"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-88653711,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-66678,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",-0.08235294117647063,eng-7379508,False,0.7411764860153198,-0.08235294117647063,378865980,1

Currently, electric vehicles account for just 1 per cent of sales outside of Europe, China and the US, according to Bernstein, and countries with patchy power grids will take much, much longer to catch up.

This could lead, they believe, to a two-tier world where richer countries have transitioned to electric cars but consumers in large parts of the developing world are left driving dirty older cars, or being priced out of private car ownership altogether.

The companies more cautious about EVs also believe that the way the transition in the car industry is handled could have a big impact on the climate. If consumers who could cut emissions by switching to hybrid models in large parts of the world remain in their old cars, the impact will be higher emissions until, by choice or government edict, they eventually move to electric cars.

""If the charging infrastructure isn't there, it doesn't matter how much CO2 would be replaced, customers won't buy it and instead keep their old car for longer,"" Gill Pratt, Toyota's chief scientist, told the FT.

German premium brand BMW agrees. ""It is absolutely unrealistic to expect that every customer in the world will have sufficient access to charging infrastructure in 2030,"" says BMW's sales chief Pieter Nota, in a thinly-disguised reference to the date when arch-rival Mercedes plans to switch to electric-only sales in Europe. ""That's our conviction and that's why it's important to still be able to offer internal combustion engines at that point in time in order to serve these customer needs.""

Ultimately, those who remain stubbornly off the battery-car bandwagon share a single concern: a fear that carmakers are being led by regulators too fast down the single technological avenue of battery electric vehicles.

Carlos Tavares, the head of Stellantis who has for years been the torchbearer for the industry's cautious wing, often likens carmakers to lightbulb manufacturers as they moved from incandescent bulbs to LED lights. He notes that low-energy bulbs, an interim step, were once considered the future, but they were fundamentally compromised: inefficient, expensive and dim.

Had the bulb-makers of the world been forced by regulators to go ""all in"" on these substandard products, the industry would have collapsed when better technology eventually presented itself. ""We are trying not to predict the future, but to make sure we can be successful whatever the future will be,"" says Toyota's science leader Pratt.

While regulators claim to be neutral about which technologies replace the combustion engine, in reality the strict timeframes they have set for the reduction of carbon emissions leave carmakers with little choice but to pursue battery car sales.

Not only is the cost of hydrogen and the lack of necessary fuelling infrastructure likely to hold back that technology before 2030, but regulators are pushing for non-electric solutions such as biomethane to be used in other areas of transport. The shipping and trucking sectors, for example, need to go green but cannot rely wholly on batteries due to their relatively heavy weight.

""We don't want to create a race in which the transport modes cannibalise each other in the fight for the same future,"" EU transport commissioner Adina-Ioana Valean told the FT's Global Boardroom summit earlier this month. ""So, for example, I would prefer to see the use of biomethane [go] towards maritime [transport], which does not have other solutions, [rather] than to waste it on the road where we have the solution for the moment.""

The holdouts insist they are also urging regulators to look at the bigger emissions picture. BMW, for instance, says it is following a ""holistic approach"" to sustainability that will focus on using more recycled materials in combustion engine models, and ethical sourcing of raw materials.

It aims to cut emissions from the supply chain by 60 per cent in real terms, eliminate emissions from its factories, and find ways of reusing car parts at the end of their life. ""Climate friendly mobility is not automatically created through a higher number of electric vehicles on the road,"" says BMW, which nevertheless has launched two new battery models -- the iX and the i4 -- to cater for the growing market.

Toyota makes a similar point when asked why it has not followed others by going ""all in"" on battery cars. ""It depends what you mean by 'all in', if it means reducing carbon, then there's no doubt Toyota is all in,"" says Toyota Europe president Matt Harrison, who notes the company's 20-year bet on hybrid technology has seen it sail past EU CO2 targets ahead of rivals. Earlier this month the Japanese group unveiled 30 new battery models, but still stressed its dedication to other technologies including hydrogen power.

""Carlos [Tavares] is a heterodoxical thinker, so are BMW and Toyota,"" says one industry insider who has witnessed the internal struggles in automotive boardrooms as executives wrestle with the question of how to cut emissions responsibly. ""You need to have options, you can't close down options.""

However, keeping options open forces carmakers to spread costs across a number of competing technologies at a time when the industry is already forced to shoulder vast investments into new electric systems. The industry plans to spend $US330 billion on battery electric vehicle technology alone in the next five years, according to calculations from consultancy AlixPartners.

The need to consolidate spending was the rationale for the €50 billion merger of France's PSA and Fiat Chrysler to create Stellantis, as well as the driving force behind Ford's global alliance with VW.

Yet the added costs from developing electric cars will still flow through to electric car prices, which remain stubbornly dearer than their petrol forebears despite falling battery costs. The gap is widest at the lowest end of the market, with the cars that often serve as many drivers' first entry into motoring.

""Electrification brings 50 per cent additional costs . . . there is no way we can transfer 50 per cent of [the] additional cost to the final consumer, because most parts of the middle classes will not be able to pay,"" Stellantis boss Tavares told a Reuters conference this month. The Portuguese executive previously warned that pricing people out of private vehicle ownership risked sparking the types of gilets jaunes protests that startled Paris in 2018.

Scratch the surface, and even Mercedes agrees that richer buyers will turn electric first. ""I think we're in a good position that our customer profile is perhaps a set of customers that will more easily access charging infrastructure,"" Mercedes-Benz boss Ola Kallenius told the FT. ""So that's why we have set the ambition high.""

Some of the most vocal criticism of the rapid push into EVs has come from suppliers, some of whom face possible extermination if the industry does fully transition to battery models.

Privately-owned Bosch, which makes engines for many household auto brands, appealed directly to politicians to tone down their electric-only rhetoric. ""Modern diesel engines no longer have higher [nitrogen oxide tailpipe] emissions than other vehicles, and particulate emissions for the gasoline engines has been decreased by the factor of 100,"" Bosch's chief executive Volkmar Denner said in February. ""This would have been impossible if we had stopped investing in these technologies.""

However, many environmental groups are not convinced by these arguments. ""The likes of Bosch and BMW refuse to see the writing on the wall that there is no future for combustion vehicles,"" says Julia Poliscanova, a director at environmental research group Transport & Environment.

She says clean fuel technology and hybrid vehicles are merely ""an attempt to prolong the life of the dying industry"", adding: ""The problem is that the planet can't afford such detours. Policymakers must set stricter emission rules this decade to avoid the unnecessary carbon pollution from such laggards.""

As the industry debates how quickly to move to EVs, some analysts believe one of the dividing lines could be the differing ownership structures of companies. While the Ford family, led by environmentalist Bill Ford, has backed ending the sale of polluting cars by 2040, in general the family-backed groups tend to be more cautious.

BMW, whose anchor shareholder -- the Quandt and Klatten families -- own as much as 46 per cent of the company, is under less pressure to convince investors of its plans than many of its listed rivals. Toyota is still run by Akio Toyoda, the grandson of the founder, while the Agnelli and Peugeot families stand behind Stellantis.

This has led to some speculation that part of the reason for GM and Daimler to be so vocal about their ambitions is an attempt to garner some of the EV stardust that has propelled Tesla's value to more than $US1 trillion, and seen the market values of sales-less start-ups Rivian and Lucid soar ahead of established names such as Ford and Renault.

""There is definitely a PR exercise at Mercedes and GM that we need to discount,"" says Philippe Houchois, an automotive analyst at Jefferies. ""It could be that a [share] re-rating is what they need -- they are not protected by a family or a state.""

He adds that companies that have significantly reduced emissions from their vehicles often get overlooked by investors unless they embrace the accepted narrative. ""Toyota has done more for EU emissions in the last five years than any of the others [by selling hybrids], but the market is so obsessed with ESG all-in and not very discriminating when looking at all these issues,"" he adds.

The gulf between enthusiasts and holdouts is also thinner than it appears. Mercedes for example, has caveated its 2030 commitment by saying it will be all electric ""where market conditions allow"". Houchois adds: ""The big difference between BMW and Mercedes is BMW says upfront what the problems are -- Merc says it is 'all in' but you have to look at the fine print"". He adds that the electric sales of both companies in Europe by 2030 are likely to be ""be broadly the same"".

The cynical view, therefore, is that the EV enthusiasts want to boost their share prices in the short-term, while the laggards want to dominate sales of engine cars once their rivals leave the field. Both are slightly unfair, though neither is wholly untrue.

Even those who have made the leap are realistic about the barriers that remain. ""We need to have everybody in that transition and transformation that's happening, and we need to make sure nobody is left behind,"" says GM sustainability boss Kristen Siemen. ""And that, you know, for us means having a range of products across all segments and price points. It's about ensuring infrastructure is available in all areas.""

The company's two largest markets are the US and China, neither of which signed the COP26 pledge to end polluting vehicle sales by 2035, and which both face vast challenges in ensuring widespread adoption of EVs. Nor is GM completely turning its back on engine improvements during the technology's twilight years.

""We're going to continue to develop fuel-saving technologies and more efficient solutions,"" says Siemen. ""The policies need to be there in order to achieve customer acceptance. But we're going to do everything we can and continue to work with those partners to make it happen.""

The likes of Bosch say their continued development of combustion engine technology plays a pivotal, if unglamorous, role in fighting climate change. With the vast majority of drivers still sitting behind the wheel of a petrol or diesel car for decades to come, reducing emissions will be as vital as eliminating them from newer models, they argue.

""We need combustion engines. We need to build combustion engines. We need to have them on the road,"" said Denner in February. ""And that's a fact.""","{'uri': 'afr.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Australian Financial Review'}",[],https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/77c60c51ac2781aa220ac1c647545583b63a57e4,-0.1372549019607843,,False,0,-0.1372549019607843,378865800,1
